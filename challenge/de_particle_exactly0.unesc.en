"What we tell you is for your good," added Bessie, in no harsh voice, "you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you away, I am sure."
Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.
Returning, I had to cross before the looking- glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed.
All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality: and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie's evening stories represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing before the eyes of belated travellers.
I can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world. My heart beat thick, my head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort.
I shall be killed if--"
Yet, I thought, I ought to have been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone out in the carriage with their mama. Abbot, too, was sewing in another room, and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys and arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted kindness.
Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.
Not a hint, however, did she drop about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that she would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable and rooted aversion.
I gave another tug before I answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied--
The handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low, I looked up at--a black pillar!--such, at least, appeared to me, at first sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug: the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft by way of capital.
My look or something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with extreme though suppressed irritation.
I got up, I went to the door; I came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up to her.
The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to which I clung with kisses.
Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead; thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and mysterious regions.
We passed through several towns, and in one, a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the passengers alighted to dine.
The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, with portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher of water and mug in the middle of each tray.
To-night I was to be Miss Miller's bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.
Again the bell rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out--
I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables, I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she looked at the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of them, the stout one, whispered--
She went on-- "You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be hungry:--I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served to all."
I saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the title--it was "Rasselas;" a name that struck me as strange, and consequently attractive.
I hardly know where I found the hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the serious or substantial.
She looks as if she were thinking of something beyond her punishment--beyond her situation: of something not round her nor before her.
The spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I sank prostrate with my face to the ground.
Besides, Jane"--she paused.
Continue to act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us."
"No, ma'am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have often heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that she would always keep me."
On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns's, and when we entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her shoulder.
Classes were broken up, rules relaxed.
She went into the house; I stayed behind a few minutes to plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and which I feared would wither if I left them till the morning.
While pondering this new idea, I heard the front door open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse.
Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of long chimneys and clouds of smoke--"but," I argued, "Thornfield will, probably, be a good way from the town."
"A little." There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me to sit down and give her a tune:
I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.
He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set off.
The car stopped at the front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.
She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments.
The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a house.
"Where are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?" for she was moving away.
The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,--a woman of between thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard, plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely be conceived.
The conversation, thus turned on Adele, continued till we reached the light and cheerful region below.
October, November, December passed away.
I took up my muff and walked on.
When I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant; and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye, traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.
Leah entered.
I closed the piano and returned.
Old Mr. Rochester and Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could not brook what he had to suffer in it.
By my word! there is something singular about you," said he: "you have the air of a little _nonnette_; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face; as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.
"Now," he continued, again addressing me, "I have received the pilgrim--a disguised deity, as I verily believe.
Only one thing, I know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that you regretted your own imperfection;--one thing I can comprehend: you intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane.
She entered, transformed as her guardian had predicted.
And spreading out her dress, she chasseed across the room till, having reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled lightly round before him on tip-toe, then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming--
"Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte;" then rising, she added, "C'est comme cela que maman faisait, n'est-ce pas, monsieur?"
She was returning: of course my heart thumped with impatience against the iron rails I leant upon.
The carriage stopped, as I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that is the very word for an opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a cloak--an unnecessary encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening--I knew her instantly by her little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of her dress, as she skipped from the carriage-step.
Celine's chamber-maid entered, lit a lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew.
The head of my bed was near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my bedside--or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels.
She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start, no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of guilt, or fear of detection.
A tread creaked on the stairs at last. Leah made her appearance; but it was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax's room.
I am afraid," she continued, "you are not well to- day: you look flushed and feverish."
Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the dusk. For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down a hill.
A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.
First, I wished to see whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax's description; secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted of her; and thirdly--it will out!--whether it were such as I should fancy likely to suit Mr. Rochester's taste.
He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter.
I try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes of the purse I am forming--I wish to think only of the work I have in my hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap; whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall the moment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him, what he deemed, an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down on my face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to overflow; in whose emotions I had a part.
As if loveliness were not the special prerogative of woman--her legitimate appanage and heritage!
I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out; rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr. Rochester.
"Bride!" Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.
I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons, because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given her his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from him that treasure.
A post-chaise was approaching.
The post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it was a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.
I have an inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford to give.' The forehead declares, 'Reason sits firm and holds the reins, and she will not let the feelings burst away and hurry her to wild chasms.
I reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had.
"Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!" he said. He swallowed the contents and returned it to me.
The cry died, and was not renewed.
But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness. They ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the confusion was inextricable.
Calming himself by an effort, he added--
I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer, and once more retraced my steps.
Mr. Rochester opened the shirt of the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged away blood, trickling fast down.
Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear, either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him.
Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.
"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart," said Mason.
Soon he produced his pocket-book: "Here," said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but fifteen.
"Yes; what then?"
Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I've a use for it."
Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired.
Oh, I wish he would cease tormenting me with letters for money? I have no more money to give him: we are getting poor.
And then I strangled a new-born agony--a deformed thing which I could not persuade myself to own and rear--and ran on.
When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her knitting, and I had assumed a low seat near her, and Adele, kneeling on the carpet, had nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affection seemed to surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent prayer that we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we thus sat, Mr. Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to take pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable--when he said he supposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted daughter back again, and added that he saw Adele was "prete a croquer sa petite maman Anglaise"--I half ventured to hope that he would, even after his marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.
Where the sun had gone down in simple state--pure of the pomp of clouds--spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven.
The moth roamed away.
"In there," pointing to the apartment she had left; and I went in, and there he stood.
"Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty," said he: "truly pretty this morning.
"You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having, Jane; but for God's sake, don't desire a useless burden!
She put up her spectacles, shut the Bible, and pushed her chair back from the table.
She looked at me bewildered.
"I'll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty to them that are enslaved--your harem inmates amongst the rest.
Being pushed unceremoniously to one side--which was precisely what I wished--he usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany himself: for he could play as well as sing.
"I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have no wish to go to bed."
Look wicked, Jane: as you know well how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me you hate me--tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather be incensed than saddened."
I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the summit.
I sat down on the narrow ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and woke."
I rose, bathed my head and face in water, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill, and determined that to none but you would I impart this vision.
I felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he hastily flung his arms round me.
One of his lately hired servants, a footman, answered it.
The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did the same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or eyes, he said, "Proceed."
The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails.
He heaved a sort of shuddering sigh, and taking me in his arms, carried me downstairs.
"A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the open casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the air grew pure. I then framed and fixed a resolution.
Last January, rid of all mistresses--in a harsh, bitter frame of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life--corroded with disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual, faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came back to England.
Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes; erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at once quitted the room.
Despair added, "Farewell for ever!"
A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed, and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.
I stood up and lifted my hand; it stopped.
He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the vehicle was empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.
The wish to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was amongst my fellow-beings.
I considered.
I reflected.
A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently wanted. I took leave.
Instinctively I turned my face again to the village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others were there besides the woman I ventured the request--"Would she give me a roll for this handkerchief?"
And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground.
There has been a beggar-woman--I declare she is not gone yet!--laid down there.
And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me.
"No more I ought," said she: "Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I wor wrang--but I've clear a different notion on you now to what I had.
Looking up as I drew near--"You have a question to ask of me?" he said.
Diana intimated that this would be a different parting from any they had ever yet known.
"Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what _might have been_," said Mr. Rivers, "and contrasts it somewhat too vividly with what _is_."
"With all his firmness and self-control," thought I, "he tasks himself too far: locks every feeling and pang within--expresses, confesses, imparts nothing.
He continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he looked, the firmer he held it, the more he seemed to covet it.
"Don't imagine such hard things.
I humoured him: the watch ticked on: he breathed fast and low: I stood silent.
I waited, expecting he would say something I could at least comprehend; but his hand was now at his chin, his finger on his lip: he was thinking.
"Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from Mr. Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed 'Alice Fairfax.'"
And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the portrait-cover.
He got up, held it close to my eyes: and I read, traced in Indian ink, in my own handwriting, the words "JANE EYRE"--the work doubtless of some moment of abstraction.
One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! at hearing one has got a fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder business; on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.
My uncle I had heard was dead--my only relative; ever since being made aware of his existence, I had cherished the hope of one day seeing him: now, I never should.
He looked rather embarrassed.
"Well, then," he said, "I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping.
I paused--he stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed enough.
It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general holiday approached.
Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously--I warn you of that.
And really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made.
I saw he was of the material from which nature hews her heroes--Christian and Pagan--her lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous column, gloomy and out of place.
He gave each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.
St. John had a book in his hand--it was his unsocial custom to read at meals--he closed it, and looked up.
Diana, who chanced to be in a frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his will; for hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed--
He looked up the pass and down the hollow; his glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat, let the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.
He continued--
In the tractability with which, at my wish, you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have since persevered in it--in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with which you have met its difficulties--I acknowledge the complement of the qualities I seek.
Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his succeeded in making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear.
Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice? It is the cause of God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you.
His eye, bent on me, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry.
"And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I presume?" said he, after a considerable pause.
The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back--"Where are you?"
I replied, that nothing ailed me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.
It stopped as I beckoned.
And if I did--what then?
God bless him!
We saw him approach her; and then, ma'am, she yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay smashed on the pavement."
I _cannot_ see, but I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst.
"Well, you can leave me, ma'am: but before you go" (and he retained me by a firmer grasp than ever), "you will be pleased just to answer me a question or two." He paused.
"Some days since: nay, I can number them--four; it was last Monday night, a singular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced frenzy--sorrow, sullenness.
Mary did look up, and she did stare at me: the ladle with which she was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of time John's knives also had rest from the polishing process: but Mary, bending again over the roast, said only--
She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, 'Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
However, this bottle was not marked 'poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.
Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, 'If you please, sir--' The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.
I'll try and say "How doth the little--"' and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--
'I must be growing small again.' She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
There was no 'One, two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over.
Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, 'I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, 'Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!'
'He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran. 'How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am!
Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
'Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. 'I've something important to say!'
Alice folded her hands, and began:--
This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, 'You're looking for eggs, I know that well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a serpent?'
It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. 'Come, there's half my plan done now!
Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause.
She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--
'Speak roughly to your little boy,
'Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. 'Come, it's pleased so far,' thought Alice, and she went on.
'Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: 'but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.'
'And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, 'or you'll be asleep again before it's done.'
'They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; 'and they drew all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'
The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on: '--that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness-- you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'
Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table. 'Now, I'll manage better this time,' she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden.
The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for her.
'Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next.
The Queen smiled and passed on.
By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: 'but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, 'as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.' So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.
'I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to feel a little worried.
Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.
The Mock Turtle went on.
He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice. 'Same as if he had a bone in his throat,' said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back.
'How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!' thought Alice; 'I might as well be at school at once.' However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:--
'Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently: 'it begins "I passed by his garden."'
The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this:--
Soo--oop of the e--e--evening, Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!' 'Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of 'The trial's beginning!' was heard in the distance.
'Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.
'Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact.
Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.
'I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. 'I've so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant till now.'
'--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door.
And he added in an undertone to the Queen, 'Really, my dear, you must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!'
'Oh, I beg your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.
At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book, cackled out 'Silence!' and read out from his book, 'Rule Forty-two.
'It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; 'in fact, there's nothing written on the outside.' He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added 'It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.'
'No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, 'and that's the queerest thing about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)
'Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, 'and go on till you come to the end: then stop.'
'All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself: '"We know it to be true--" that's the jury, of course-- "I gave her one, they gave him two--" why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'
We were in class when the head-master came in, followed by a "new fellow," not wearing the school uniform, and a school servant carrying a large desk. Those who had been asleep woke up, and every one rose as if just surprised at his work.
The head-master made a sign to us to sit down.
"Rise," said the master.
"Rise," repeated the master, "and tell me your name."
"Five hundred lines for all the class!" shouted in a furious voice stopped, like the Quos ego*, a fresh outburst. "Silence!" continued the master indignantly, wiping his brow with his handkerchief, which he had just taken from his cap.
They were given at spare moments in the sacristy, standing up, hurriedly, between a baptism and a burial; or else the cure, if he had not to go out, sent for his pupil after the Angelus*.
He grew thin, his figure became taller, his face took a saddened look that made it nearly interesting.
Charles had seen in marriage the advent of an easier life, thinking he would be more free to do as he liked with himself and his money. But his wife was master; he had to say this and not say that in company, to fast every Friday, dress as she liked, harass at her bidding those patients who did not pay. She opened his letter, watched his comings and goings, and listened at the partition-wall when women came to consult him in his surgery.
When it stopped of its own accord in front of those holes surrounded with thorns that are dug on the margin of furrows, Charles awoke with a start, suddenly remembered the broken leg, and tried to call to mind all the fractures he knew.
The watchdogs in their kennels barked, dragging at their chains.
Right along the outbuildings extended a large dunghill, from which manure liquid oozed, while amidst fowls and turkeys, five or six peacocks, a luxury in Chauchois farmyards, were foraging on the top of it.
They grew angry and left the house.
Thinking that, after all, he should lose nothing, Charles promised himself to ask her in marriage as soon as occasion offered, but each time such occasion did offer the fear of not finding the right words sealed his lips.
According to their different social positions they wore tail-coats, overcoats, shooting jackets, cutaway-coats; fine tail-coats, redolent of family respectability, that only came out of the wardrobe on state occasions; overcoats with long tails flapping in the wind and round capes and pockets like sacks; shooting jackets of coarse cloth, generally worn with a cap with a brass-bound peak; very short cutaway-coats with two small buttons in the back, close together like a pair of eyes, and the tails of which seemed cut out of one piece by a carpenter's hatchet.
Charles from horseback threw her a kiss; she answered with a nod; she shut the window, and he set off.
And then along the highroad, spreading out its long ribbon of dust, along the deep lanes that the trees bent over as in arbours, along paths where the corn reached to the knees, with the sun on his back and the morning air in his nostrils, his heart full of the joys of the past night, his mind at rest, his flesh at ease, he went on, re-chewing his happiness, like those who after dinner taste again the truffles which they are digesting.
He wanted to see her again; he turned back quickly, ran up the stairs with a beating heart.
By moonlight in the garden she recited all the passionate rhymes she knew by heart, and, sighing, sang to him many melancholy adagios; but she found herself as calm after as before, and Charles seemed no more amorous and no more moved.
The chateau, a modern building in Italian style, with two projecting wings and three flights of steps, lay at the foot of an immense green-sward, on which some cows were grazing among groups of large trees set out at regular intervals, while large beds of arbutus, rhododendron, syringas, and guelder roses bulged out their irregular clusters of green along the curve of the gravel path. A river flowed under a bridge; through the mist one could distinguish buildings with thatched roofs scattered over the field bordered by two gently sloping, well timbered hillocks, and in the background amid the trees rose in two parallel lines the coach houses and stables, all that was left of the ruined old chateau.
On the dark wainscoting of the walls large gold frames bore at the bottom names written in black letters. She read: "Jean-Antoine d'Andervilliers d'Yvervonbille, Count de la Vaubyessard and Baron de la Fresnay, killed at the battle of Coutras on the 20th of October, 1587."
They started again, and with a more rapid movement; the Viscount, dragging her along disappeared with her to the end of the gallery, where panting, she almost fell, and for a moment rested her head upon his breast.
She chose the Viscount, and the violin struck up once more.
She forgot the tune of the quadrilles; she no longer saw the liveries and appointments so distinctly; some details escaped her, but the regret remained with her.
And she sat there making the tongs red-hot, or looked at the rain falling.
The Church is on the other side of the street, twenty paces farther down, at the entrance of the square.
The hostess reddened with vexation. The chemist went on—
Binet came in.
He wore a blue frock-coat falling in a straight line round his thin body, and his leather cap, with its lappets knotted over the top of his head with string, showed under the turned-up peak a bald forehead, flattened by the constant wearing of a helmet.
Sometimes, on Sundays, I go and stay there with a book, watching the sunset."
Emma continued, "And what music do you prefer?"
Moreover, it contains everything that is agreeable in a household—a laundry, kitchen with offices, sitting-room, fruit-room, and so on. He was a gay dog, who didn't care what he spent.
"In fact," observed the clerk, "these works, not touching the heart, miss, it seems to me, the true end of art.
When from afar he saw her languid walk, and her figure without stays turning softly on her hips; when opposite one another he looked at her at his ease, while she took tired poses in her armchair, then his happiness knew no bounds; he got up, embraced her, passed his hands over her face, called her little mamma, wanted to make her dance, and half-laughing, half-crying, uttered all kinds of caressing pleasantries that came into his head.
Then the peasant woman, taking her aside behind an elm tree, began talking to her of her husband, who with his trade and six francs a year that the captain—
It flowed noiselessly, swift, and cold to the eye; long, thin grasses huddled together in it as the current drove them, and spread themselves upon the limpid water like streaming hair; sometimes at the tip of the reeds or on the leaf of a water-lily an insect with fine legs crawled or rested.
Wallflowers had sprung up between the bricks, and with the tip of her open sunshade Madame Bovary, as she passed, made some of their faded flowers crumble into a yellow dust, or a spray of overhanging honeysuckle and clematis caught in its fringe and dangled for a moment over the silk.
His fat, flabby, beardless face seemed dyed by a decoction of liquorice, and his white hair made even more vivid the keen brilliance of his small black eyes.
What was certain was that he made complex calculations in his head that would have frightened Binet himself.
Then Monsieur Lheureux delicately exhibited three Algerian scarves, several packets of English needles, a pair of straw slippers, and finally, four eggcups in cocoanut wood, carved in open work by convicts.
Emma grew thinner, her cheeks paler, her face longer.
The evening vapours rose between the leafless poplars, touching their outlines with a violet tint, paler and more transparent than a subtle gauze caught athwart their branches.
A long ray of the sun fell across the nave and seemed to darken the lower sides and the corners.
And he went on—
"Why?" And she looked like one awaking from a dream.
"Nothing much.
Emma shuddered.
The chemist went on—
The landlady did not answer. Homais went on—
The landlady never took her eyes off the "Cafe Francois" and the chemist went on—
Well, if my work had been given to the public—" But the druggist stopped, Madame Lefrancois seemed so preoccupied.
Emma's gesture, however, had only been meant for a warning; for Monsieur Lheureux was accompanying them, and spoke now and again as if to enter into the conversation.
The beasts were there, their noses towards the cord, and making a confused line with their unequal rumps.
Perhaps he could hear, but certainly he could see nothing, because of the visor of his helmet, that fell down on his nose.
It reached you in fragments of phrases, and interrupted here and there by the creaking of chairs in the crowd; then you suddenly heard the long bellowing of an ox, or else the bleating of the lambs, who answered one another at street corners.
And you, aged servants, humble domestics, whose hard labour no Government up to this day has taken into consideration, come hither to receive the reward of your silent virtues, and be assured that the state henceforward has its eye upon you; that it encourages you, protects you; that it will accede to your just demands, and alleviate as much as in it lies the burden of your painful sacrifices."
Six weeks passed.
She turned towards him with a sob.
And as she objected that she had no horse, Monsieur Rodolphe offered one.
Rodolphe had put on high soft boots, saying to himself that no doubt she had never seen anything like them. In fact, Emma was charmed with his appearance as he stood on the landing in his great velvet coat and white corduroy breeches.
At the bottom of the hill Rodolphe gave his horse its head; they started together at a bound, then at the top suddenly the horses stopped, and her large blue veil fell about her.
They dismounted.
Then some hundred paces farther on she again stopped, and through her veil, that fell sideways from her man's hat over her hips, her face appeared in a bluish transparency as if she were floating under azure waves.
It is impossible!" She rose to go.
He has an old cob, still very fine, only a little broken-kneed, and that could be bought; I am sure, for a hundred crowns." He added, "And thinking it might please you, I have bespoken it—bought it.
It stuck out sideways from the end of a small tub half-buried in the grass on the edge of a ditch.
He went on—
Emma wanted to bribe her servant with a present, but it would be better to find some safe house at Yonville.
She escaped, smiling, palpitating, undressed.
What next!" "'—Performed an operation on a club-footed man.' I have not used the scientific term, because you know in a newspaper everyone would not perhaps understand.
I understand that your work, that the whirl of the world may have kept you from care for your salvation.
He saw himself dishonoured, ruined, lost; and his imagination, assailed by a world of hypotheses, tossed amongst them like an empty cask borne by the sea and floating upon the waves.
Often, even in the middle of the day, Emma suddenly wrote to him, then from the window made a sign to Justin, who, taking his apron off, quickly ran to La Huchette.
Madame Homais!" And he added with a meditative air, "As if she were a lady like madame!"
Emma pounced upon and opened it.
"Leave the room!" said the young woman, springing up with a bound.
One would have thought that an artist apt in conception had arranged the curls of hair upon her neck; they fell in a thick mass, negligently, and with the changing chances of their adultery, that unbound them every day.
Then he reflected.
He rose to go; and as if the movement he made had been the signal for their flight, Emma said, suddenly assuming a gay air—
To get back something of her, he fetched from the cupboard at the bedside an old Rheims biscuit-box, in which he usually kept his letters from women, and from it came an odour of dry dust and withered roses.
Rodolphe stopped here to think of some good excuse.
I am going away.
"I shall be far away when you read these sad lines, for I have wished to flee as quickly as possible to shun the temptation of seeing you again.
For forty-three days Charles did not leave her. He gave up all his patients; he no longer went to bed; he was constantly feeling her pulse, putting on sinapisms and cold-water compresses. He sent Justin as far as Neufchatel for ice; the ice melted on the way; he sent him back again. He called Monsieur Canivet into consultation; he sent for Dr. Lariviere, his old master, from Rouen; he was in despair. What alarmed him most was Emma's prostration, for she did not speak, did not listen, did not even seem to suffer, as if her body and soul were both resting together after all their troubles.
"So you love him?" she said.
I beat him, did you see, in a way!—Now take my advice.
But a young woman stepped forward, throwing a purse to a squire in green.
He confessed, moreover, that he did not understand the story because of the music, which interfered very much with the words.
No doubt Emma did not herself know, quite absorbed as she was by the charm of the seduction, and the necessity of defending herself from it; and contemplating the young man with a moved look, she gently repulsed the timid caresses that his trembling hands attempted.
But a rustle of silk on the flags, the tip of a bonnet, a lined cloak—it was she!
"Read!" she said, holding out a paper to him. "Oh, no!"
The everlasting guide went on—
The cab went on again, and as soon as it reached the Carrefour Lafayette, set off down-hill, and entered the station at a gallop.
At about six o'clock the carriage stopped in a back street of the Beauvoisine Quarter, and a woman got out, who walked with her veil down, and without turning her head.
She shivered.
And Charles confessed she had gone off a little.
Those who had secured seats the evening before kept it waiting; some even were still in bed in their houses.
They stopped at the barrier; Emma undid her overshoes, put on other gloves, rearranged her shawl, and some twenty paces farther she got down from the "Hirondelle."
Shop-boys in caps were cleaning up the shop-fronts, and women with baskets against their hips, at intervals uttered sonorous cries at the corners of streets. She walked with downcast eyes, close to the walls, and smiling with pleasure under her lowered black veil.
She plunged into dark alleys, and, all perspiring, reached the bottom of the Rue Nationale, near the fountain that stands there.
He went up, opened the door, entered—What an embrace!
Often they had started when, with a sudden movement, his hat entered the diligence through the small window, while he clung with his other arm to the footboard, between the wheels splashing mud. His voice, feeble at first and quavering, grew sharp; it resounded in the night like the indistinct moan of a vague distress; and through the ringing of the bells, the murmur of the trees, and the rumbling of the empty vehicle, it had a far-off sound that disturbed Emma. It went to the bottom of her soul, like a whirlwind in an abyss, and carried her away into the distances of a boundless melancholy. But Hivert, noticing a weight behind, gave the blind man sharp cuts with his whip. The thong lashed his wounds, and he fell back into the mud with a yell. Then the passengers in the "Hirondelle" ended by falling asleep, some with open mouths, others with lowered chins, leaning against their neighbour's shoulder, or with their arm passed through the strap, oscillating regularly with the jolting of the carriage; and the reflection of the lantern swinging without, on the crupper of the wheeler; penetrating into the interior through the chocolate calico curtains, threw sanguineous shadows over all these motionless people. Emma, drunk with grief, shivered in her clothes, feeling her feet grow colder and colder, and death in her soul.
She cried out, scandalised.
Emma began to laugh, a strident, piercing, continuous laugh; she had an attack of hysterics.
One of these days I shall turn up at Rouen, and we'll go the pace together."
What seduced him above all else was chic. He admired an elegant toilette in a well-furnished apartment, and as to bodily qualities, he didn't dislike a young girl.
The druggist went on drinking, eating, and talking.
What had once charmed now frightened him a little.
Near the hotel there was always a kind of loafer who accosted travellers, and who would not refuse.
She wept; she even called him "her good Monsieur Lheureux."
At last Leon swore he would not see Emma again, and he reproached himself with not having kept his word, considering all the worry and lectures this woman might still draw down upon him, without reckoning the jokes made by his companions as they sat round the stove in the morning. Besides, he was soon to be head clerk; it was time to settle down. So he gave up his flute, exalted sentiments, and poetry; for every bourgeois in the flush of his youth, were it but for a day, a moment, has believed himself capable of immense passions, of lofty enterprises. The most mediocre libertine has dreamed of sultanas; every notary bears within him the debris of a poet.
She collapsed, more overcome than if felled by the blow of a pole-axe.
The servant appeared.
Felicite came back.
And, shaking him by both hands that she grasped tightly, she added—
Then he was afraid, and to avoid any explanation he smote his forehead, crying—
"Morel is to come back to-night; he will not refuse me, I hope" (this was one of his friends, the son of a very rich merchant); "and I will bring it you to-morrow," he added.
Then she remembered the day when, all anxious and full of hope, she had entered beneath this large nave, that had opened out before her, less profound than her love; and she walked on weeping beneath her veil, giddy, staggering, almost fainting.
The coach had gone on again when suddenly Monsieur Homais leant out through the window, crying—
The notary came in pressing his palm-leaf dressing-gown to his breast with his left arm, while with the other hand he raised and quickly put on again his brown velvet cap, pretentiously cocked on the right side, whence looked out the ends of three fair curls drawn from the back of the head, following the line of his bald skull.
She sprang up and said to him—
"What a wretch! what a scoundrel! what an infamy!" she said to herself, as she fled with nervous steps beneath the aspens of the path. The disappointment of her failure increased the indignation of her outraged modesty; it seemed to her that Providence pursued her implacably, and, strengthening herself in her pride, she had never felt so much esteem for herself nor so much contempt for others. A spirit of warfare transformed her. She would have liked to strike all men, to spit in their faces, to crush them, and she walked rapidly straight on, pale, quivering, maddened, searching the empty horizon with tear-dimmed eyes, and as it were rejoicing in the hate that was choking her.
And no doubt she was suggesting something abominable to him; for the tax-collector—yet he was brave, had fought at Bautzen and at Lutzen, had been through the French campaign, and had even been recommended for the cross—suddenly, as at the sight of a serpent, recoiled as far as he could from her, crying—
"But where is she?" continued Madame Caron, for she had disappeared whilst they spoke; then catching sight of her going up the Grande Rue, and turning to the right as if making for the cemetery, they were lost in conjectures.
The nurse, however, was a long while gone. But, as there was no clock in the cot, Emma feared she was perhaps exaggerating the length of time. She began walking round the garden, step by step; she went into the path by the hedge, and returned quickly, hoping that the woman would have come back by another road. At last, weary of waiting, assailed by fears that she thrust from her, no longer conscious whether she had been here a century or a moment, she sat down in a corner, closed her eyes, and stopped her ears. The gate grated; she sprang up. Before she had spoken Mere Rollet said to her—
The dogs in their kennels all barked, and the noise of their voices resounded, but brought out no one.
She collected her thoughts for one moment, and, strengthening herself by the feeling of present necessity, went in.
She yielded to his words, still more to his voice and the sight of him, so that, she pretended to believe, or perhaps believed; in the pretext he gave for their rupture; this was a secret on which depended the honour, the very life of a third person.
Emma went on, with dainty little nods, more coaxing than an amorous kitten—
Rodolphe thought this was an outburst of her love. As she did not speak, he took this silence for a last remnant of resistance, and then he cried out—
For you love yourself; you live well.
He went out.
She uttered a sharp cry.
He fell back terror-stricken.
The child, serious, and still half-asleep, was carried in on the servant's arm in her long white nightgown, from which her bare feet peeped out. She looked wonderingly at the disordered room, and half-closed her eyes, dazzled by the candles burning on the table. They reminded her, no doubt, of the morning of New Year's day and Mid-Lent, when thus awakened early by candle-light she came to her mother's bed to fetch her presents, for she began saying—
Pale as a statue and with eyes red as fire, Charles, not weeping, stood opposite her at the foot of the bed, while the priest, bending one knee, was muttering words in a low voice.
Charles was on the other side, on his knees, his arms outstretched towards Emma.
They all drew near.
Felicite put down a mattress for him in the drawing-room.
He threw himself upon it and fell asleep.
Charles came in, and advancing towards the bed, slowly drew the curtains.
Charles watched them burn, tiring his eyes against the glare of their yellow flame.
They dragged him down into the sitting-room. Then Felicite came up to say that he wanted some of her hair.
The priest did not need any persuading; he went out to go and say mass, came back, and then they ate and hobnobbed, giggling a little without knowing why, stimulated by that vague gaiety that comes upon us after times of sadness, and at the last glass the priest said to the druggist, as he clapped him on the shoulder—
Old Rouault arrived, and fainted on the Place when he saw the black cloth!
Day broke.
The bell began again.
Besides, Charles was not of those who go to the bottom of things; he shrank from the proofs, and his vague jealousy was lost in the immensity of his woe.
Charles consented to this, but when the time for parting came, all his courage failed him.
They came back at nightfall, when the only light left in the Place was that in Binet's window.
And thinking he wanted to play; she pushed him gently.
The piece! the piece! commence or we will commence again!"
The music of high and low instruments immediately became audible from the interior of the stage; the tapestry was raised; four personages, in motley attire and painted faces, emerged from it, climbed the steep ladder of the theatre, and, arrived upon the upper platform, arranged themselves in a line before the public, whom they saluted with profound reverences; then the symphony ceased.
It made Gringoire shudder as though it had been an electric shock.
All the people were staring and listening.
Laughter and applause burst forth.
From the moment of the cardinal's entrance, Gringoire had never ceased to tremble for the safety of his prologue.
But the usher's brutal monologue came to an end; every one had arrived, and Gringoire breathed freely once more; the actors continued bravely.
Coppenole went on,−−
Gringoire looked. It was but too true.
Oh! good God! even to the ferryman's!"
They are watching a hundred fagots burn; a fine spectacle!"
The young girl turned round in affright.
First came Egypt. The Duke of Egypt headed it, on horseback, with his counts on foot holding his bridle and stirrups for him; behind them, the male and female Egyptians, pell−mell, with their little children crying on their shoulders; all−−duke, counts, and populace−−in rags and tatters.
Only joy made itself felt, only pride dominated.
There is my pallet burning." And comparing himself to the pilot who suffers shipwreck by night, "~Salve~," he added piously, "~salve, maris stella~!"
And he passed on.
The three who had Gringoire in their clutches led him in front of this hogshead, and the entire bacchanal rout fell silent for a moment, with the exception of the cauldron inhabited by the child.
"Pick me up that knave, and hang him without ceremony."
Gringoire shuddered, and turned towards the side whence the clamor proceeded.
He began seriously to take himself for a personage in a fairy tale; he cast his eyes about him from time to time to time, as though to see if the chariot of fire, harnessed to two−winged chimeras, which alone could have so rapidly transported him from Tartarus to Paradise, were still there.
But this is no affair of mine, and I will come to the point.
Gringoire began to eat eagerly.
The young girl's mind was elsewhere, and Gringoire's voice had not the power to recall it.
"Why not this evening?" resumed the poet tenderly. "Why not me?"
"Don't touch it! It is an amulet.
She began to sing, to an ancient air,−− My father is a bird, my mother is a bird. I cross the water without a barque, I cross the water without a boat.
The very constitution of the Christian church is not attacked by it.
At the end of the fifteenth century, the Faubourg strides across it, passes beyond it, and runs farther.
Those which first caught the eye were the Bernardins, with their three bell towers; Sainte−Geneviève, whose square tower, which still exists, makes us regret the rest; the Sorbonne, half college, half monastery, of which so admirable a nave survives; the fine quadrilateral cloister of the Mathurins; its neighbor, the cloister of Saint−Benoit, within whose walls they have had time to cobble up a theatre, between the seventh and eighth editions of this book; the Cordeliers, with their three enormous adjacent gables; the Augustins, whose graceful spire formed, after the Tour de Nesle, the second denticulation on this side of Paris, starting from the west.
Some of these faubourgs were important: there were, first, starting from la Tournelle, the Bourg Saint−Victor, with its one arch bridge over the Bièvre, its abbey where one could read the epitaph of Louis le Gros, ~epitaphium Ludovici Grossi~, and its church with an octagonal spire, flanked with four little bell towers of the eleventh century (a similar one can be seen at Etampes; it is not yet destroyed); next, the Bourg Saint− Marceau, which already had three churches and one convent; then, leaving the mill of the Gobelins and its four white walls on the left, there was the Faubourg Saint−Jacques with the beautiful carved cross in its square; the church of Saint− Jacques du Haut−Pas, which was then Gothic, pointed, charming; Saint−Magloire, a fine nave of the fourteenth century, which Napoleon turned into a hayloft; Notre−Dame des Champs, where there were Byzantine mosaics; lastly, after having left behind, full in the country, the Monastery des Chartreux, a rich edifice contemporary with the Palais de Justice, with its little garden divided into compartments, and the haunted ruins of Vauvert, the eye fell, to the west, upon the three Roman spires of Saint−Germain des Prés.
From the tower where we are placed, the Hôtel Saint−Pol, almost half hidden by the four great houses of which we have just spoken, was still very considerable and very marvellous to see.
It was towards this epoch, that the excessive heat of the summer of 1466 caused that grand outburst of the plague which carried off more than forty thousand souls in the vicomty of Paris, and among others, as Jean de Troyes states, "Master Arnoul, astrologer to the king, who was a very fine man, both wise and pleasant."
It is certain that the mind becomes atrophied in a defective body.
Then Quasimodo boiled and frothed; he went and came; he trembled from head to foot with the tower.
Then, said the women of the neighborhood, the whole church took on something fantastic, supernatural, horrible; eyes and mouths were opened, here and there; one heard the dogs, the monsters, and the gargoyles of stone, which keep watch night and day, with outstretched neck and open jaws, around the monstrous cathedral, barking.
And, if it was a Christmas Eve, while the great bell, which seemed to emit the death rattle, summoned the faithful to the midnight mass, such an air was spread over the sombre façade that one would have declared that the grand portal was devouring the throng, and that the rose window was watching it.
It was supposed that Flamel had buried the philosopher's stone in the cellar; and the alchemists, for the space of two centuries, from Magistri to Father Pacifique, never ceased to worry the soil until the house, so cruelly ransacked and turned over, ended by falling into dust beneath their feet.
I had two things to consult you upon, one touching my health and the other touching my star."
The archdeacon went on, appearing to reply now only to his thoughts,−−
But underlying this thought, the first and most simple one, no doubt, there was in our opinion another, newer one, a corollary of the first, less easy to perceive and more easy to contest, a view as philosophical and belonging no longer to the priest alone but to the savant and the artist.
Michael Angelo, who, no doubt, felt even in the sixteenth century that it was dying, had a last idea, an idea of despair.
The judge supposed that it had been replied to, and continued,−−
Mahiette went on.
What shall we do to rouse her?" Eustache, who, up to that moment had been diverted by a little carriage drawn by a large dog, which had just passed, suddenly perceived that his three conductresses were gazing at something through the window, and,curiosity taking possession of him in his turn, he climbed upon a stone post, elevated himself on tiptoe, and applied his fat, red face to the opening, shouting, "Mother, let me see too!"
Every limb was trembling, her voice quivered, her eyes flashed, she had raised herself upon her knees; suddenly she extended her thin, white hand towards the child, who was regarding her with a look of astonishment. "Take away that child!" she cried.
The torturer stopped.
But wrath, hatred, despair, slowly lowered over that hideous visage a cloud which grew ever more and more sombre, ever more and more charged with electricity, which burst forth in a thousand lightning flashes from the eye of the cyclops.
Madame de Gondelaurier continued, "Fine tapestries, in truth. A work so esteemed that it passes as unrivalled."
Phoebus looked, and said,−− "Yes, I recognize her by her goat."
"You left me in your stead, my beauty," pursued the captain, whose tongue was unloosed when speaking to a girl out of the street, "a crabbed knave, one−eyed and hunchbacked, the bishop's bellringer, I believe.
At this reply uttered carelessly by the captain, like a stray stone, whose fall one does not even watch, Colombe began to laugh, as well as Diane, Amelotte, and Fleur−de−Lys, into whose eyes at the same time a tear started.
"I do not understand." And she fell to caressing the pretty animal, repeating, "Djali!
Fleur−de−Lys ran up and trembled.
From the moment when the archdeacon caught sight of this stranger, his attention seemed divided between him and the dancer, and his face became more and more gloomy.
"I agree, my master, that 'tis better to philosophize and poetize, to blow the flame in the furnace, or to receive it from carry cats on a shield.
Now that spirit seemed to have departed; the cathedral seemed gloomy, and gladly remained silent; festivals and funerals had the simple peal, dry and bare, demanded by the ritual, nothing more.
He halted, turned his back to the bells, and crouched down behind the projecting roof of slate, fixing upon the dancer that dreamy, sweet, and tender look which had already astonished the archdeacon on one occasion.
An idea had occurred to him as he laced his boots, but he rejected it at first; nevertheless, it returned, and he put on his waistcoat wrong side out, an evident sign of violent internal combat.
Then he sank down so deeply on the arm−chair and the table, that Jehan lost him from view behind the great pile of manuscripts.
I left the door unlocked expressly; enter Master Jacques!" The scholar entered boldly.
Accordingly, he assumed an extremely soft tone and began,−− "My good brother, do you hate me to such a degree as to look savagely upon me because of a few mischievous cuffs and blows distributed in a fair war to a pack of lads and brats, ~quibusdam marmosetis~?
The archdeacon began an examination of the vessel. "What has he engraved on his crucible? ~Och! och~! the word which expels fleas!
Phoebus exclaimed: "A purse in your pocket, Jehan! 'tis the moon in a bucket of water, one sees it there but 'tis not there.
Two boon companions came forth.
Give it to me, ~bédieu~!" or I will search you, were you as leprous as Job, and as scabby as Caesar!"
We will take, the Sainte−Marthe chamber; you can look at your ease from the kennel hard by."
The old woman was bent double, clad in tatters, with a shaking head, pierced with two small eyes, and coiffed with a dish clout; wrinkled everywhere, on hands and face and neck; her lips retreated under hergums, and about her mouth she had tufts of white hairs which gave her the whiskered look of a cat.
The captain rose to please her, chiding her with a smile of satisfaction,−−
Phoebus retreated amid said in a cold tone,−−
When she recovered her senses, she was surrounded by soldiers of the watch they were carrying away the captain, bathed in his blood the priest had disappeared; the window at the back of the room which opened on the river was wide open; they picked up a cloak which they supposed to belong to the officer and she heard them saying around her,
Take care, La Falourdel, that he doth not knock at your door.' One evening I was spinning on my wheel, there comes a knock at my door; I ask who it is.
Two men enter.
He goes out.
The gentlemen of the police enter, and not knowing just at the first moment what the matter was, and being merry, they beat me.
"And that dry leaf!" added another.
All eyes turned towards a small door, which opened, and, to the great agitation of Gringoire, gave passage to a pretty goat with horns and hoofs of gold.
Pierrat turned the handle of the screw−jack, the boot was contracted, and the unhappy girl uttered one of those horrible cries which have no orthography in any human language.
And she fell back upon the leather bed, dying, doubled up, allowing herself to hang suspended from the strap buckled round her waist.
He resumed,−−
Look!
The pretty broidered shoe is no longer anything but an instrument of torture which eternally crushes the heart of the mother.
The Place du Parvis Notre−Dame, upon which the balcony looked, as the reader knows, presented at that moment a singular and sinister spectacle which caused the fright of the timid Fleur−de−Lys to change its nature.
He stirred up in the depths of his heart all his hatred, all his malevolence; and, with the cold glance of a physician who examines a patient, he recognized the fact that this malevolence was nothing but vitiated love; that love, that source of every virtue in man, turned to horrible things in the heart of a priest, and that a man constituted like himself, in making himself a priest, made himself a demon.
This fine pleasantry made the courtesan laugh, and Jehan left the room.
Then the archdeacon rose to his feet, and ran without halting, towards Notre−Dame, whose enormous towers he beheld rising above the houses through the gloom.
Her thoughts awoke also, and returned to her one by one.
Then he gave her a profoundly sorrowful glance and fled.
"I frighten you.
This singular thing astonished her. She had been so long unaccustomed to sleep!
He went on,−−
He continued,−−
A groom came and unhitched the horse and led it to the stable of the house.
From that window, situated in the cloister, he could see la Esmeralda's chamber. He often saw herself with her goat, sometimes with Quasimodo.
Quasimodo looked him full in the face, a trembling seized him, and he released the priest and shrank back.
The young girl, deeply agitated by this violent scene, fell back exhausted on her bed, and began to sob and weep.
"Envy for what, monsieur the archdeacon? their strength, their armor, their discipline?
He came back clapping his hands. "If you were less engrossed with the fine clothes of men of war, monsieur the archdeacon, I would entreat you to come and see this door.
"What next?"
Give me something to drink.
Lay siege to the church, burst in the doors, drag out the beautiful girl, save her from the judges, save her from the priests, dismantle the cloister, burn the bishop in his palace−−all this we will do in less time than it takes for a burgomaster to eat a spoonful of soup.
I have a fief in the Rue Tirechappe, and all the women are in love with me, as true as Saint Eloy was an excellent goldsmith, and that the five trades of the good city of Paris are the tanners, the tawers, the makers of cross−belts, the purse−makers, and the sweaters, and that Saint Laurent was burnt with eggshells.
A vagabond presented his banner to Clopin, who planted it solemnly between two paving−stones.
Stay! I think I hear the lock breaking up."
The panels cracked, the carved work flew into splinters, the hinges, at every blow, leaped from their pins, the planks yawned, the wood crumbled to powder, ground between the iron sheathing.
Below that fire, below the gloomy balustrade with its trefoils showing darkly against its glare, two spouts with monster throats were vomiting forth unceasingly that burning rain, whose silvery stream stood out against the shadows of the lower façade.
Andry the Red laughed in an idiotic way: "Notre−Dame is making work for the hospital," said he.
The shot sped.
The loneliness of this chair made it apparent that only one person had a right to sit down in this apartment.
He continued,−−
Continue, Olivier."
Olivier made a mark with his thumb against the article of the "rascally foot soldier," and passed on.
The king began to walk slowly round the little edifice, examining it carefully, while Master Olivier, who followed him, read aloud the note.
The new comer understood, and began in a low tone to give a very terrified account, to which the king listened calmly, while Guillaume Rym called Coppenole's attention to the face and dress of the new arrival, to his furred cowl, (~caputia fourrata~), his short cape, (~epitogia curta~), his robe of black velvet, which bespoke a president of the court of accounts.
The king could not refrain from saying: "Good!" he went on,−− "Are they armed?"
Tristan l'Hermite advanced and pointing to Gringoire,−− "Sire, can this one be hanged also?" This was the first word that he had uttered.
Then turning towards the Flemings: "Come, look at this, gentlemen.
Then, laying his hand familiarly on Coppenole's shoulder,−− "You were saying, Master Jacques?"
He no longer laughed, he was terrible, he went and came; the fox was changed into a hyaena.
The night advances, and we are nearer the morning than the evening."
She uttered a feeble cry.
Gringoire rose. "
I must inform you that I have just seen the king, Louis XI., and that I have caught this oath from him,−−~Pasque−Dieu~!
The man in black did not utter a syllable; he held her firmly, and set out again at a quicker pace.
"Listen!" he said to her; and she shuddered at the sound of that fatal voice which she had not heard for a long time.
You will follow me, you will be obliged to follow me, or I will deliver you up! You must die, my beauty, or be mine! belong to the priest! belong to the apostate! belong to the assassin! this very night, do you hear?
She thought herself victorious, and continued,−−
He gave vent to a horrible cry, like the wretch to whom a hot iron is applied. "Die, then!" he said, gnashing his teeth.
She looked.
"Hold her well," said the priest; "'tis the gypsy escaped.
She would be the same age as you! so!−−I have been here fifteen years; fifteen years have I suffered; fifteen years have I prayed; fifteen years have I beat my head against these four walls−−I tell you that 'twas the gypsies who stole her from me, do you hear that? and who ate her with their teeth.−−Have you a heart? imagine a child playing, a child sucking; a child sleeping.
On the other side, in the direction of the bridge of Notre−Dame, the poor condemned girl fancied that she heard the sound of cavalry approaching.
"Madam," she cried, clasping her hands and falling on her knees, dishevelled, distracted, mad with fright; "madam! have pity!
The bars held firm.
He added, as he glanced at the Place de Grève around him, "'Tis a name which has an echo here."
The recluse breathed freely once more.
Do it.
When the mother heard the picks and crowbars mining her fortress, she uttered a terrible cry; then she began to stride about her cell with frightful swiftness, a wild beasts' habit which her cage had imparted to her.
Some workmen, a few fruit−sellers on their way to the markets on their asses, began to traverse the Grève; they halted for a moment before this group of soldiers clustered round the Rat−Hole, stared at it with an air of astonishment and passed on.
All at once, the recluse beheld the stone (for she was standing guard and never took her eyes from it), move, and she heard Tristan's voice encouraging the workers.
They thrust her back with much brutality, and noticed that her head fell heavily on the pavement. They raised her, she fell back again.
At length he summoned up courage, advanced on tiptoe, looked, entered.
He reflected that the archdeacon had done this thing, and the wrath of blood and death which it would have evoked in him against any other person, turned in the poor deaf man, from the moment when Claude Frollo was in question, into an increase of grief and sorrow.
It was presumed that he had broken the body when taking the soul, like monkeys who break the shell to get at the nut.
The presence of this gibbet sufficed to render gloomy all the surrounding places.
There was immediately a knock at the door and a man entered. He had never seen the man in this house before.
"No," said the man at the window, who threw his book down on a coffee table and stood up. "You can't go away when you're under arrest."
Franz joined in, and said, "Look at this, Willem, he admits he doesn't know the law and at the same time insists he's innocent."
He'd see to it you got a right thumping, and us and all!"
No-one stopped him doing this and he pushed his sleeves back, felt his chest, straightened his hair, went over to the three men, said, "It makes no sense," at which these three turned round to face him and came towards him with serious expressions. He finally came again to a halt in front of the supervisor's desk.
And the three of them did immediately retreat a few steps, the old pair even found themselves behind the man who then concealed them with the breadth of his body and seemed, going by the movements of his mouth, to be saying something incomprehensible into the distance.
But instead, he stood up, picked up a hard round hat that was laying on Miss Bürstner's bed and put it carefully onto his head, using both hands as if trying on a new hat.
But there was no explanation needed anyway as just then the taxi arrived, they sat inside and set off.
"It's alright," he said then, and went on, but before going up the stairs he turned round once more.
She stood up, as he had also stood up, and was a little self-conscious, she hadn't been able to understand everything that that K. said.
K., who had been lost in his thoughts in the hallway, walking up and down loudly as if it were his own room, fled behind his door.
"It's me," said K. and came out.
It turned out, though, that that was mostly possible without further ado, as almost all the doors were left open and the children ran in and out.
He wondered what he could say to get all of them to support him together or, if that were not possible, to at least get the support of the others for a while.
The judge had become quite cross but seemed to have no power over those below him in the hall, he tried to reduce what harm had been done in the gallery and jumped up threatening them, his eyebrows, until then hardly remarkable, pushed themselves up and became big, black and bushy over his eyes.
It should have been rewarded with some applause here and there but everything was quiet, they were all clearly waiting for what would follow, perhaps the quietness was laying the ground for an outbreak of activity that would bring this whole affair to an end.
He's always after me, he'd only just left when you arrived."
She stroked K.'s hand once more, jumped up and ran over to the window.
K. saw this as confirmation of the tyranny the student held over the woman and which she had already complained about, he stood up and walked up and down the room.
"You're wasting your breath," said K., then he reached his hand out towards the woman and said, "come with me."
K. followed them slowly. He realised that this was the first unambiguous setback he had suffered from these people.
So off I go running as fast as I can, shout the message through the crack in the door of the office I've been sent to, so out of breath they'll hardly be able to understand it, run back here again, but the student's been even faster than I have - well he's got less far to go, he's only got to run down the steps.
They moved back slightly, but not as far as where they had been sitting before.
And before leaving, he held him a lot harder, shoved him back onto the bench and walked on.
A young woman, probably summoned by the loudness of K.'s voice, entered and asked, "What is it the gentleman wants?"
He felt as if he were on a ship in a rough sea, as if the water were hitting against the wooden walls, a thundering from the depths of the corridor as if the torrent were crashing over it, as if the corridor were swaying and the waiting litigants on each side of it rising and sinking.
"What an idea!" said K. standing up, "there's no question of that.
At the door, however, both of them had to step back as it opened and Captain Lanz entered.
K. assumed she was pretending and knocked harder, eventually, when the knocking brought no result, he carefully opened the door with the sense of doing something that was not only improper but also pointless.
Look at him, look how fat he is - the first strokes of the cane will just get lost in all that fat. Do you know what it is that's made him so fat?
"I would make it well worth your while if you would let them go," said K., and without looking at the whip-man again - as such matters are best carried on with both pairs of eyes turned down - he pulled out his wallet.
"No," said K. as he stood up, "and you're speaking too loud, Uncle, I expect one of the staff is listening at the door and I find that rather unpleasant.
K.'s uncle nearly forgot the need to show any consideration for the man who lay ill in bed, he stood up, walked up and down behind the carer, and K. would not have been surprised if he had grabbed hold of her skirts behind her and dragged her away from the bed.
And he introduced him, "Chief Clerk Josef K."
But behind the door there was no-one, K.'s uncle came back not disappointed, as her not listening seemed to him worse than if she had been, but probably somewhat embittered.
But even for the junior officials, the proceedings in the courtrooms are usually kept secret, so they are hardly able to see how the cases they work with proceed, court affairs appear in their range of vision often without their knowing where they come from and they move on further without their learning where they go.
Those who were at the bottom of the steps could not believe it at first, so they sent somebody out to go and look behind the door to see if there really was no-one there, and only then did they all gather together and probably didn't even dare to complain, as it's far from being the lawyers' job to introduce any improvements in the court system, or even to want to.
But even this apology was spoken in such a mechanical way and with such false intonation that the manufacturer would certainly have noticed if he had not been fully preoccupied with his business affairs.
K. still had enough control of himself to turn away from the deputy director and direct his friendly, albeit stiff, smile only at the manufacturer, he made no other retaliation, bent down slightly and supported himself with both hands on his desk like a clerk, and watched as the two gentlemen, still talking, took the papers from his desk and disappeared into the manager's office.
K. stepped back and immediately exclaimed, "That's what the deputy director's been telling you!"
K. wanted to apologise for his behaviour in the conversation earlier that day, but the manufacturer would tolerate no interruption, shoved his briefcase up high in his armpit to show that he was in a hurry, and carried on.
And even if this advice doesn't turn out to make all the difference I still think it'll be very important once you've got it.
The deputy director listened to them for a short while, he also looked at K. as he held his hat in his hand cleaning the dust off it here and there, and then he said, "Gentlemen, there is a very simple way to solve this.
The sight of the picture seemed to make him feel like working, he rolled up his shirtsleeves, picked up a few of the crayons, and K. watched as a reddish shadow built up around the head of the judge under their quivering tips and radiated out the to edges of the picture.
"How's that?" asked K., as he leant his head to one side and looked at the painter.
K. valued the painter's help far more highly because it was offered in a way that was more harmless and open.
As a result, he said, "So let's pay no more attention to absolute acquittal, but you mentioned two other possibilities."
At the stove stood Leni, in a white apron as always, breaking eggs into a pot standing on a spirit lamp.
But now, before anything else, take your coat off!"
Yes, well over five years," he then added, pulling out an old briefcase, "I've got everything written down; I can tell you the exact dates if you like.
They all stood up for me.
Instead of which there were just more hearings, and most of them went through the same things anyway; I had all the answers off pat like in a church service; there were messengers from the court coming to me at work several times a week, or they came to me at home or anywhere else they could find me; and that was very disturbing of course (but at least now things are better in that respect, it's much less disturbing when they contact you by telephone), and rumours about my trial even started to spread among some of the people I do business with, and especially my relations, so I was being made to suffer in many different ways but there was still not the slightest sign that even the first hearing would take place soon.
You take it far too much for granted, what your friends do for you.
K. went over to the low, windowless room and looked in from the doorway. The room contained a narrow bed which filled it completely, so that to get into the bed you would need to climb over the bedpost.
Anyway, perhaps I should at least explain this peculiarity of hers to you, but you seem rather disturbed, the way you're looking at me, and so that's why I'll do it, this peculiarity of hers consists in this; Leni finds most of the accused attractive.
When I was by myself I never did anything about my case, I was hardly aware of it, but then, once there was someone representing me, everything was set for something to happen, I was always, without cease, waiting for you to do something, getting more and more tense, but you did nothing.
She went over to him and sat on the edge of the bed.
"In fact he became quite cross when I started to talk about Block to him. 'Don't talk to me about Block,' he said.
On the contrary, the first statement even hints at the second.
But in the doorkeeper's character there are also other features which might be very useful for those who seek entry to the law, and when he hinted at some possibility in the future it always seemed to make it clear that he might even go beyond his duty.
They see his ideas of what's inside the law as rather childish, and suppose he's afraid himself of what he wants to make the man frightened of.
He had not been notified they would be coming, but K. sat in a chair near the door, dressed in black as they were, and slowly put on new gloves which stretched tightly over his fingers and behaved as if he were expecting visitors.
After exchanging a few courtesies about who was to carry out the next tasks - the gentlemen did not seem to have been allocated specific functions - one of them went to K. and took his coat, his waistcoat, and finally his shirt off him.
If I didn't have my parents to think about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd have gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel.
Gregor, however, had no thought of opening the door, and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquired from his travelling, of locking all doors at night even when he was at home.
Gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be put into extreme danger.
It was not very clear how much she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarter of an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor's mother for her dismissal as if she had done her an enormous service. She even swore emphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had happened, even though no-one had asked that of her.
No sooner had she come in than she would quickly close the door as a precaution so that no-one would have to suffer the view into Gregor's room, then she would go straight to the window and pull it hurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating. Even if it was cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little while.
They do feed themselves. And here I am, dying!"
Gregor's father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his hands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself out for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head kept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all.
He sat upright, played with his uniform cap between the plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal, and occasionally looked down at Gregor as he lay there immobile. "We have to try and get rid of it", said Gregor's sister, now speaking only to her father, as her mother was too occupied with coughing to listen, "it'll be the death of both of you, I can see it coming.
In this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in seizing that principality, and you are not able to keep those friends who put you there because of your not being able to satisfy them in the way they expected, and you cannot take strong measures against them, feeling bound to them.
Therefore, the Romans, foreseeing troubles, dealt with them at once, and, even to avoid a war, would not let them come to a head, for they knew that war is not to be avoided, but is only to be put off to the advantage of others; moreover they wished to fight with Philip and Antiochus in Greece so as not to have to do it in Italy; they could have avoided both, but this they did not wish; nor did that ever please them which is for ever in the mouths of the wise ones of our time:—Let us enjoy the benefits of the time—but rather the benefits of their own valour and prudence, for time drives everything before it, and is able to bring with it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good.
The contrary happens in kingdoms governed like that of France, because one can easily enter there by gaining over some baron of the kingdom, for one always finds malcontents and such as desire a change.
Nor is it enough for you to have exterminated the family of the prince, because the lords that remain make themselves the heads of fresh movements against you, and as you are unable either to satisfy or exterminate them, that state is lost whenever time brings the opportunity.
In conclusion, the arms of others either fall from your back, or they weigh you down, or they bind you fast.
There is first to note that, whereas in other principalities the ambition of the nobles and the insolence of the people only have to be contended with, the Roman emperors had a third difficulty in having to put up with the cruelty and avarice of their soldiers, a matter so beset with difficulties that it was the ruin of many; for it was a hard thing to give satisfaction both to soldiers and people; because the people loved peace, and for this reason they loved the unaspiring prince, whilst the soldiers loved the warlike prince who was bold, cruel, and rapacious, which qualities they were quite willing he should exercise upon the people, so that they could get double pay and give vent to their own greed and cruelty.
He became hated by the whole world, and also feared by those he had around him, to such an extent that he was murdered in the midst of his army by a centurion.
And although a complete proof of this latter cannot be shown, nevertheless there was some evidence of it at the battle of Ravenna, when the Spanish infantry were confronted by German battalions, who follow the same tactics as the Swiss; when the Spaniards, by agility of body and with the aid of their shields, got in under the pikes of the Germans and stood out of danger, able to attack, while the Germans stood helpless, and, if the cavalry had not dashed up, all would have been over with them.
He accosted me with trepidation and passed on.
A winged odor went away.
But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the kingdom of inorganization.
Its immense weight caused an unusually sharp, grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges.
Completely unnerved, I leaped to my feet; but the measured rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed.
Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me.
'We'll see when the time comes,' thought Oblonsky, and got up, put on his grey dressing-gown lined with blue silk, tied the cords and drawing a full breath of air into his broad chest went with his usual firm tread toward the window, turning out his feet that carried his stout body so lightly, drew up the blind and rang loudly.
He tore open the telegram and read it, guessing at the words, which (as so often happens in telegrams) were misspelt, and his face brightened.
Having looked through his letters, Oblonsky drew the Departmental papers toward him, and turning over the pages of two files made a few notes on them with a big pencil; then pushing them aside, began to drink his coffee. At the same time he unfolded the still damp morning paper, and began reading.
Oblonsky's tendency and opinions were not his by deliberate choice: they came of themselves, just as he did not choose the fashion of his hats or coats but wore those of the current style.
Think, nine years... Can't they atone for a momentary – a momentary...'
'A momentary infatuation...' he said, and was going on, but at those words her lips tightened again as if with pain, and again the muscle in her right cheek began to twitch.
Darya Alexandrovna listened, and her face softened suddenly.
We used to have guardianships and judgeships as soft jobs, and now we've Zemstvos – not bribes, but unearned salaries!' he went on as warmly as if he had just been contradicted.
'What don't you understand?' asked Oblonsky with his usual merry smile, as he took out a cigarette.
Go there, and I'll call for you and we'll dine somewhere together.'
Levin listened no longer but sat waiting for the professor to go.
'Incapable!' said Koznyshev. 'No, you don't look at it from the right point of view.'
The bushy birch trees in the Garden with all their branches weighed down by snow seemed attired in new festive garments.
'I'll go and put them on at once,' he said, and went to hire some skates.
And in fact, as soon as he had uttered these words her face lost its kind expression – as when the sun hides behind a cloud – and Levin noticed that familiar play of her features which indicated an effort of mind: a wrinkle appeared on her smooth forehead.
WHEN THEY ENTERED THE RESTAURANT Levin could not help noticing something peculiar in his friend's expression, a kind of suppressed radiance in his face and whole figure. Oblonsky took off his overcoat, and with his hat on one side walked into the dining-room, giving his orders to the Tartar waiters, in their swallow-tail coats, with napkins under their arms, who attached themselves to him. Bowing right and left to his acquaintances who, here as elsewhere, greeted him joyfully, he passed on to the buffet, drank a glass of vodka and ate a bit of fish as hors-d'oeuvre, and said something to the painted Frenchwoman, bedecked with ribbons and lace, who sat at a little counter – something that made even this Frenchwoman burst into frank laughter.
'Well, and what do you say to it?' asked Levin with a trembling voice, feeling that all the muscles of his face were quivering. 'What do you think of it?'
Because such happiness does not exist on earth. But I have struggled with myself, and found that without that there's no life for me.
Oblonsky burst out laughing.
But just consider, here are two women: one insists only on her rights, and her rights are your love, which you cannot give her; and the other sacrifices herself and demands nothing.
She felt that this evening, when those two men were to meet for the first time, would decide her fate; and she kept picturing them to herself, now individually and now together.
At that moment another lady entered the room and Levin rose.
Vronsky rose and looking cordially into Levin's eyes pressed his hand.
We admit the existence of electricity, which we don't understand, why can't there be other forces which we do not yet know, but which...'
'Let us try table-turning now, Princess Kitty, please do,' said Vronsky. 'May we, Princess?' he said to her mother and he rose and looked round for a suitable table.
Just as the others began settling round the table and Levin was about to go, the old Prince came in, and having greeted the ladies he turned to Levin.
She rose and embraced her sister-in-law.
Yes, I can,' said Anna, after a minute's consideration. Her mind had taken in and weighed the situation, and she added, 'Yes, I can, I can.
Well, thank heaven Steve is stopping a long time with Dolly,' she added changing the subject, and she rose, dissatisfied with something, Kitty thought.
Seizing the first opportunity she rose and, stepping firmly and lightly, went out to fetch her album.
Although Kitty's gown and coiffure and all her other adornments had given her much trouble and thought, she now entered the ballroom in her complicated dress of white net over a pink slip, as easily and simply as if these bows and laces and all the details of her toilet had not cost her or her people a moment's attention, as if she had been born in this net and lace and with that high coiffure and the rose and its two leaves on the top.
She smiled at his praise, and over his shoulder continued to survey the ball-room.
'Pardon, pardon, a waltz – a waltz,' shouted Korsunsky from the other end of the room, and seizing the first girl within reach he himself began dancing.
And he moved slowly on, trying to draw her with him.
The woman rose, came out from behind the partition and saw Constantine.
Nicholas Levin continued speaking:
He considered an entire change of economic conditions nonsense; but he had always felt the injustice of his superfluities compared with the peasant's poverty, and now decided, in order to feel himself quite justified, that though he had always worked hard and lived simply, he would in future work still more and allow himself still less luxury.
A candle just brought in gradually lit up the study and its familiar details became visible: the stag's horns, the book shelves, the looking-glass, the hot-air aperture of the stove with its brass lid, which had long been in need of repair, his father's couch, the large table on which were an open volume, a broken ash-tray, and an exercise-book in his handwriting.
His steward entered and said that, 'the Lord be thanked,' everything was all right, but that the buckwheat had burned in the new drying kiln.
He listened to Agatha Mikhaylovna's talk of how Prokhor had forgotten the Lord, was spending on drink the money Levin had given him to buy a horse with, and had beaten his wife nearly to death; he listened and read, and remembered the whole sequence of thoughts raised by what he was reading.
It was a book of Tyndall's on heat. He recalled his disapproval of Tyndall's self-conceit concerning the cleverness of his experiments and his lack of a philosophic outlook.
She blushed and stopped.
To get over it she rose, threw off her wrap, and took off the cape of her coat.
She rose and came to herself, understanding that they had stopped at a station and that this was the guard.
'Vronsky! Bravo!' exclaimed Petritsky jumping up and noisily pushing back his chair.
Kamerovsky rose also, and, without waiting for him to go, Vronsky shook hands with him and went to his dressing-room.
She sees our dear Buzulukov standing there' – Petritsky imitated the pose 'the Grand Duchess asks him for his helmet, but he won't let her have it!
Vronsky shook with laughter, and long after, when he was already talking of other things, he again went off into roars of hearty laughter, showing his compact row of strong teeth, at the remembrance of the helmet.
Having heard all the news, Vronsky, with the help of his valet, put on his uniform and went to report himself.
'Well, what of that?
As if tears were the necessary lubricant without which the machine of mutual confidence could not work properly between the sisters, after having had a cry they started talking of indifferent matters, and in so doing understood one another.
'Oh, you must hear this!' cried Betsy, laughing and turning to a lady who was just entering the box. 'He has made me laugh so!'
After considering the whole question, the Commander decided to let the matter drop; but, for amusement, he asked Vronsky for particulars of the interview, and could not help laughing for a long time as he listened to the description of how the Titular Councillor suddenly again flared up at the recollection of some incident of the affair, and how Vronsky manoeuvred so as to retire just at the last half-word of reconciliation, pushing Petritsky before him.
The conversation in both circles, as always happens at first, hesitated for a few minutes, was interrupted by greetings, recognitions, and offers of tea, and seemed to be seeking something to settle on.
He was looking at the door with a strange new expression on his face.
Anna entered the room holding herself, as usual, very erect, and without changing the direction of her eyes approached her hostess, walking with that quick, firm yet light step which distinguished her from other Society women. She shook hands; smilingly, and with the same smile looked round at Vronsky.
Anna rose and went up to Betsy.
His face brightened.
From time to time he stopped, generally on the parquet floor of the lamp-lit dining-room, and thought: 'Yes, it is necessary to decide and to stop it: to express my opinion of it and my decision.' Then he turned back again.
ANNA WALKED IN WITH BOWED HEAD, playing with the tassels of her hood.
Karenin started and bent his hands to crack his fingers.
'But Society noticed, and that disturbs him! You are not well, Alexis Alexandrovich!' she added, rose and was about to pass out of the room, but he moved forward as if wishing to stop her.
'It's all over,' she said. 'I have nothing but you left.
WHEN LEVIN FIRST RETURNED FROM MOSCOW, and while he still started and blushed every time he remembered the disgrace of the refusal, he had said to himself, 'I blushed and started like this when I was ploughed in physics and had to remain in the second class; and in the same way I felt myself lost when I made a mess of my sister's affair that had been entrusted to me.
After he had for a while admired his cows, all familiar to him to the minutest detail, Levin gave orders for them to be driven into the field and for the calves to be let out into the yard.
Levin waved his hand angrily and went to the barn to look at the oats, then he came back to the stable.
'We will buy some more.
It began to get dark.
Ryabinin rose and smiled silently, surveying Levin from his feet to his head.
That's the way Ryabinin does business, no fussing about kopeks,' he said, frowning and flourishing his pocket-book.
You will again call me a reactionary or some other dreadful name, but all the same it vexes and hurts me to see on all sides the impoverishment of the noblesse, to which I too belong and to which, in spite of the merging of the classes, I am very glad to belong...
But it hurts me to see this impoverishment as a result of, – shall I call it simplicity?
'Let us go. I have finished,' said Vronsky, and he rose and moved toward the door.
'Get up, you've slept enough!' said Yashvin, stepping behind the partition and shaking by the shoulder the dishevelled Petritsky, who lay with his nose buried in the pillow.
Let us have a drink together! Vronsky, will you have a drink?' said Petritsky, getting up and wrapping himself to the arms in a rug of tiger-skin pattern.
'Get away!' said Vronsky, as he put on the overcoat his servant had handed him. 'Where to now?' asked Yashvin.
He laughed merrily, showing his compact row of teeth, and drawing his cap over the bald patch, went out and got into the calèche.
Having made sure that she was alone, and wishing to take her by surprise (he had not promised to come that day and she would certainly not expect him to come before the races), he went, holding up his sword and stepping carefully along the sand-strewn flower-bordered path to the verandah facing the garden.
He noticed this, and his face assumed that submissive, slavishly-devoted expression that had such an effect on Anna.
He gave her a look full of emotion, humbly kissed her hand, rose, and began silently pacing up and down the verandah.
He saw Bryansky, stayed with him five minutes, and drove back at a gallop.
How do you do, mon cher?' said Oblonsky, shining here, amid all this Petersburg brilliancy, no less than he shone in Moscow, with his rosy face and glistening, well-brushed whiskers. 'I came yesterday and, am very glad that I shall witness your triumph.
The winning-post was opposite the pavilion.
'It is this,' said the doctor, beckoning over Slyudin's head to his coachman to drive up. 'It's this,' and with his white hands he took a finger of his kid glove and stretched it; 'if you try to break a cord that is slack it is not easy to break it, but strain that cord to its utmost and the weight of a finger will snap it.
He only managed to get back at five, his dinner-time, and having dined with his private secretary, he invited the latter to drive with him to his country house and to go to the races with him.
Varenka, however, came in the evening and brought her music.
Kitty, deeply moved, gazed silently with wide-open eyes at Varenka.
'Yes, I really must be going!' said Varenka, rising. 'I have to look in at Madame Berthe's; she asked me to.'
'We are all arranging to go for a drive up the mountains to-morrow,' replied Kitty.
There one wakes up without any hurry, gets a bit cross about something, grumbles a bit, comes well to one's senses, and thinks everything well over without hurrying.'
'I must get home,' said Varenka, rising and bursting into another fit of laughter.
She did not renounce all she had learnt, but realized that she had deceived herself when thinking that she could be what she wished to be.
Kitty returned to Russia quite cured!
Levin, on the contrary, was impatient to get home in order to give orders about hiring the mowers on the morrow, and to decide about the hay harvest, which greatly occupied his mind.
'"Eh-h-h?" ' Constantine Levin was being carried away, and was presenting the judge and the idiot Aleshka; it seemed to him that all this was relevant to the case in point.
'Wait a moment! One can't reason that way, you know,' he remarked; but Constantine, wishing to justify the failing of which he was aware in himself (his indifference to the general welfare), continued:
They went on mowing long and short rows, good and poor grass.
As they were about to begin another swath the old man drew Levin's attention to the little boys and girls approaching from all sides along the road and through the long grass, hardly visible above it, carrying jugs of kvas stoppered with rags, and bundles of bread which strained their little arms.
When the old man got up and, having said grace, lay down beneath the willows with an armful of grass under his head, Levin did the same, regardless of the flies, importunate and persistent in the sunshine, and of the crawling insects that tickled his perspiring face and body. He at once fell asleep, waking only when the sun touched the opposite side of the willows and reached him.
Levin read it aloud.
'What can I have been disputing about?' he thought. 'Of course I was right, and he was right too, so it's all right!...
'Yes, he wrote that you had moved here, and he thought I might be of some use to you,' replied Levin, and having said this grew confused. Without finishing what he was going to say he continued walking beside the trap, breaking off twigs from the lime trees and biting them.
I can well imagine how strange everything here must seem to you, used as you are to managing a town house; and if you require anything I am quite at your disposal.'
'Oh, no! The heart does tell her; but just imagine: you men, having views on a girl, come to the house, get to know her, observe her and bide your time, and when you are quite certain that you love her you propose...'
He said good-bye and left, and she did not try to detain him any longer.
He knew that in their complex conditions of life it would not be possible to obtain those coarse proofs of a wife's infidelity which the law demanded; he knew that in that life there was a certain convention of refinement which would not allow him to bring forward such proofs, had they existed, because such an action would make him sink even lower than she in public opinion.
She knew what had stopped her, knew she had been ashamed.
She jumped up and began pacing up and down the room.
'Yes, that was very wrong,' said Anna, and putting her hand on his shoulder she looked at him not with a severe but with a timid expression which confused and gladdened the boy. She kissed him.
She shivered with cold, and with the terror that seized her with new power out in the open air.
'Go and see what it is,' she said, and, calmly prepared for anything, sat down in an easy-chair and folded her hands on her knees.
These ladies belonged to a circle which, though higher, was entirely hostile to the set Anna frequented.
From the moment that Anna gave him her love he considered his own right to her indefeasible.
Bring the Count something to eat!
Serpukhovskoy rose and said, as he stood before Vronsky,
'But our relations cannot be what they were before,' Anna began in a timid voice, looking at him with frightened eyes.
And I shan't be back to dinner.' He rose and went toward the door.
After pointing to the door with her bare arm she again stooped, hiding her handsome face, and went on scrubbing.
'There in the passage,' answered the old man, winding the reins into a ring and throwing them on the ground. 'Fix them on before we finish dinner.'
Levin took his provisions out of the tarantas and invited the old man to have tea with him.
He had planted many potatoes which had already flowered and were forming fruit, as Levin had noticed when passing the fields on the way, while Levin's own potatoes were just beginning to flower.
'That's how it is, sir,' said the old man, rising; and after crossing himself several times he thanked Levin and went out.
They agreed that an English plough ploughed better, that a scarifier worked quicker, but they found a thousand reasons why they could not use either the one or the other; and, though he was convinced that it would be necessary to lower his standards of farming, he disliked having to give up improvements the benefit of which was so clear.
He rose and began to pace up and down the room.
'There now! Visitors have come to you,' said Agatha Mikhaylovna, rising and going toward the door.
Levin listened, trying but unable to think of what to say.
Nicholas listened but evidently was not interested.
THE KARENINS, HUSBAND AND WIFE, continued to live in the same house and to meet daily, but they were wholly estranged.
They spoke of jealousy as 'the demon.' 'Yes, what had you begun telling me about the Prince?
He continued:
Don't interrupt,' she said hurriedly.
She showed how he fumbled in the sack: Her face was full of horror.
Anna exclaimed in a burst of anger, and rose to go.
He too was silent for a while and then again began in a less squeaky voice, coldly emphasizing certain chance words that had no special importance.
I should not venture so to express myself were I talking to a man of undeveloped mind,' said the lawyer, 'but I expect it is comprehensible to you.'
Dolly, ask him to come and dine with us!
Is this number seven?' Levin was standing in the middle of the room beside a peasant from Tver, measuring a fresh bearskin with a yard measure, when Oblonsky entered.
And Oblonsky got up and went downstairs to call on the new superior.
He uttered an exclamation of dismay and sat down in an easy-chair.
He rose and obediently followed her into the schoolroom.
And here I am living; my children growing, my husband returns to the family and feels his error, grows purer and better, and I live...
Every one has trouble enough of his own!' And having got himself under control, Karenin quietly rose, said good-bye, and went away.
He quickly rubbed out what he had written, handed her the chalk, and rose.
Levin rose and accompanied Kitty to the door.
Nothing, nothing, silence...' said Levin, and again wrapping the collar round his brother's face he added: 'I am very fond of you!
They arrived at the Council, and Levin listened to the secretary haltingly reading an official report which he evidently did not understand himself, but from his face Levin saw what a nice, kind, and splendid fellow he was.
All that time Levin felt uncomfortable and bored, but the stress of his joy went on increasing.
Rising, he began to pace the room. 'Quos vult perdere dementat,' he thought, quos being those who had had a hand in making the appointment.
But at sight of her husband he was filled with such confusion that he again sat down, drawing his head down between his shoulders as if trying to become invisible. Then, making an effort, he rose and said:
Why does he not come in?' she cried, calling to Vronsky on the other side of the door. 'Come, come!
'My duty is clearly defined: I must and will remain with her.
And in fact in a moment his thoughts grew confused and he began to fall into the abyss of forgetfulness.
He jumped up and sat down. 'That's at an end for me,' he thought, 'I must think over what I must do, what is left me.'
Continuing his search he leaned over to the other side, and unable to keep his balance, fell down bleeding.
The voices were silent and he entered.
She rose, but Anna, suddenly blushing, quickly seized her hand.
'Well, good-bye, my precious!' said Betsy, rising again.
She was lying down, but on hearing his step she quickly sat up in her former place and glanced at him with apprehension.
And even worse than lost. I. am not lost yet; I cannot say "all is finished": on the contrary, I feel that all is not yet finished.
'But again I say that is an accomplished fact.
To hide that embarrassment he took out a cigarette-case with a new kind of fastening which he had only just bought, smelt the leather of which it was made, and took out a cigarette.
To agree to a divorce – to give her her freedom – would mean, as he looked at it, to deprive himself of the only thing that bound him to life, the children he loved, and to deprive her of the last support on the path of virtue and cast her to perdition.
That is wrong!' The priest ceased and, with his head on one side, regarded Levin with mild kindly eyes.
ON HIS WEDDING-DAY Levin, according to custom – the Princess and Dolly insisted on his strictly conforming to custom – did not see his bride, and dined at his hotel with three bachelors who happened to drop in.
One thing was certain: there was no time to be lost, for it was already half-past six.
The best man went to find out what had occurred.
You look pale.
Several times the couple tried to guess what was expected of them, and blundered each time, the priest prompting them in whispers.
When what was necessary had at length been complied with, he made the sign of the cross over them with the rings and again gave the larger one to Kitty and the little one to Levin, and again they blundered and passed the rings twice backwards and forwards without doing what was necessary.
Dolly, Chirikov, and Oblonsky came forward to help them.
She rejoiced at the sight of Kitty and Levin, but going back to the past she thought of her own wedding, kept glancing at the beaming Oblonsky, and, forgetting the present, recollected nothing but her own young and innocent love.
We are travelling together.
Golenishchev pulled himself up and unwillingly agreed, but as the artist lived in a distant part of the town they decided to hire a carriage.
At best you are only a fool, and when you begin arguing in Italian you become a treble fool!' he said at the end of a long dispute.
During the few moments that they were silently gazing at it, Mikhaylov also regarded it with the indifferent eye of a stranger.
That is technique,' said Vronsky, addressing Golenishchev and alluding to a conversation they had had about Vronsky's despair of attaining technical mastery.
'That will come in good time,' said Golenishchev, consolingly. In his opinion Vronsky had talent, and especially the education that gives a lofty outlook on art.
He argued that Russia's poverty was caused not only by a wrong distribution of landed property and a false policy, but that of late years those evils had been fostered by a foreign civilization artificially grafted upon Russia, especially as to ways of communication – viz., the railways, which had conduced to a centralization in the cities, a growth of luxury, and consequently to a development of factories at the expense of agriculture, and, attendant upon this, to credit operations and speculation.
'Well?' he asked with a smile, and rose.
Go and write, don't let me distract you,' she said, puckering her lips. 'And I must cut out these little holes, you see!'
'No, this is awful... being a sort of slave!' exclaimed Levin, unable to restrain his annoyance any longer, but immediately conscious that he had dealt a blow to himself.
Why, since you are repenting?' she said, and jumped up and ran into the drawing-room.
As usual, after the inquiry as to what priced rooms they desired, it turned out that there was not a single good room vacant: one good room was occupied by a railway inspector, another by a lawyer from Moscow, a third by the Princess Astafyeva from the country.
She sent for the doctor, sent to the chemist's, made the maid she had brought with her help Mary Nikolavna sweep, dust, and wash; and herself washed and scrubbed some articles and spread something under the blanket. At her command things were brought in and taken out of the sick-room.
Kitty, having hurriedly shut the door behind Levin, was not looking that way; but the invalid moaned and she came toward him.
If I walk on tiptoe he will be displeased, and yet I am ashamed to tread on the whole of my foot.' But Kitty evidently did not think and had no time to think of herself.
The door opened and Kitty appeared.
He ordered the carriage that was waiting, to be unharnessed, said that he would receive no one, and did not appear at dinner.
Only in extreme cases will I apply to you,' and she rose and went out.
Sitnikov was the tutor to whom Serezha's secular education was entrusted. 'As I told you, he shows a certain coldness toward those most important questions which should stir the soul of every man and child,' he went on, speaking on the only subject which interested him outside the Service – the education of his son.
'I don't consider that I have a right to refuse,' he said timidly, raising his eyes.
Serezha jumped up, approached his father, kissed his hand, and looked at him attentively, trying to find some sign of his joy at receiving the Order of Alexander Nevsky.
But then windmills appeared, and a knife, and all became confused, and he fell asleep.
Vronsky understood that it was vain to make any further attempts and that they would have to spend those few days in Petersburg as in a strange town, avoiding contact with their former world in order not to lay themselves open to unpleasantnesses and insults which were so painful to him.
It seemed to her natural and simple that she should see her son when she was in the same town with him. But on reaching Petersburg her present social position presented itself clearly to her, and she realized that it would be difficult to arrange the meeting.
Never had she felt so humiliated as when, having called in the commissionaire, she heard from him the full account of how he had waited and had then been told that there would be no answer. Anna felt herself humiliated and wounded, but she saw that the Countess Lydia Ivanovna was right from her own point of view.
Next morning Anna went alone, and at eight o'clock got out of the hired carriage and rang the bell at the front door of the house which used to be her home.
I knew you would come!
At that moment the door opened and Vasily Lukich entered.
She had not had time even to unwrap the toys she had chosen with so much love and sadness the day before, and she took them back with her.
A waiter offered her coffee. 'Later,' she said.
Rising, she removed her bonnet and took from the table an album in which were photographs of her son at different ages.
'Then we shall not meet again?' said Yashvin, rising; and then turning to Vronsky he asked, 'Where are you dining?'
Vronsky glanced at Anna when that definite time was mentioned, which showed that care had been taken to prevent her meeting anyone there; but Anna did not seem to observe it.
Yashvin emptied another glass of brandy into the sparkling water, drank it, and then rose, buttoning his coat.
But why not come to the stalls? Take Krasinsky's place,' Yashvin added as he went out.
Send a waiter to clear it up, and get out my dress suit!'
She rose and went to the back of the box.
'It's all your fault! Your fault!' she exclaimed with tears of despair and spite in her voice, and rose.
'Kate, it is not good for you to be standing,' said her husband, with a meaning look, moving a chair toward her.
'I will come, but only as far as the threshing-floor. I shall stay there.'
'I will do it,' said Dolly, and she got up and began carefully sliding the spoon over the surface of the bubbling syrup, and now and then, to remove what had stuck to the spoon, she tapped it against a plate already covered with the yellowish pink scum, with blood-red streaks of syrup showing beneath it. 'How they'll lick it up at tea-time!' she thought of the children, remembering how she herself, when a child, used to marvel that the grown-ups did not eat the scum – the nicest part.
'Well?' he asked, looking at her with the expression with which every one addressed her nowadays.
She is all spirit.'
VARENKA WITH THE WHITE KERCHIEF OVER HER BLACK HAIR, surrounded by the children and good-naturedly and cheerfully busy with them, and evidently excited by the possibility of an offer of marriage from a man she liked, looked very attractive.
Varenka rose when Masha had picked the mushroom, breaking it into two white pieces. 'It reminds me of my childhood,' she added, moving away from the children with Koznyshev.
Even in the Levins' well-ordered household she found ways to be of use. 'I will see about supper,' she said, 'and you stay here'; and she rose to accompany Agatha Mikhaylovna.
Levin did not get in, but followed the calèche.
'It's very nice at their place,' Vasenka was saying, talking of Vronsky and Anna. 'Of course I do not take it upon myself to judge, but in their house one feels oneself to be in a family.'
'Yes,' said Kitty, with a still deeper blush, and she rose and went to her husband.
Now as he listened to her question he interpreted it in his own way.
On his head were the ruins of some sort of hat; but his gun was of a new type, as neat as a toy, and his game-bag and cartridge-belt, though much worn, were of the best quality.
The dogs returned.
Levin was rather afraid Veslovsky would tire out the horses, especially the roan on the left, whom he did not know how to hold in; but he could not resist Veslovsky's high spirits, the songs he sang all the way while sitting on the box, the stories he told, and his representation of the English way of driving four-in-hand; and after lunch they were all in the best of spirits when they reached the Gvozdevo marsh.
Her search became more and more indolent, and she looked round at the sportsmen as if in perplexity and with reproach.
'Hullo you sportsmen!' shouted one of several peasants who were sitting beside a cart from which the horses had been taken out.
Levin turned round.
'Oh, not bad!'
Why do we eat and drink, go shooting and do no work, while he is always, always working?' said Vasenka Veslovsky, evidently for the first time in his life thinking of this, and therefore speaking quite genuinely.
Come on, let's go!'
Laska paused with a mocking look at the horses and a questioning one at Levin.
'Well, if he wishes it, I will, but I can no longer answer for anything,'. thought Laska, and rushed forward at full tilt between the hummocks.
They all rose to greet Dolly.
'What is there in common between us and him?' thought Levin, as he went in search of Veslovsky.
Dolly dozed, and only woke up when approaching the inn where the horses were to be changed.
Even Kitty – young, pretty Kitty – how much plainer she has become! And I when I am pregnant become hideous, I know.
The metallic sound of a scythe being hammered beside the cart ceased, and one of the peasants rose and came toward the calèche.
The peasants beside the cart all got up and looked with merry curiosity at the visitor, making their own comments.
'Oh no!' he replied, and his face lit up with pleasure. 'If you had only seen that courtyard in spring!'
'C'est devenu tellement commun, les écoles,' [Schools have become so common.] answered Vronsky. 'Of course that's not the reason, but I...
Dolly did not reply and only looked at him with alarm.
I see that Anna is happy, quite happy, she has already told me so,' said Dolly smiling; and involuntarily while saying it she doubted whether Anna was really happy.
'Some day a son may be born, my son, and he will by law be a Karenin, and not heir either to my name or my property, and however happy we may be in our family life, and whatever children we may have, there will be no legal bond between them and me. They will be Karenin's!
They got up and went back to the house.
'Well... it's something like paste... no, putty!' replied Veslovsky, rousing general laughter.
'Well, and how's Kitty?' she asked with a deep sigh and a guilty glance at Dolly. 'Tell me the truth, Dolly: is she not angry with me?'
But imagine me living alone, without him, alone, and that will happen... everything shows that it will often happen, – that he will spend half his time from home,' she said, rising and taking a seat nearer to Dolly. 'Of course,' she went on, interrupting Dolly, who was about to reply, 'of course I won't keep him against his will!
Well?'
Anna noticed the sigh, which expressed dissent, and continued.
She rose, drew herself up, sighed deeply, and with her light steps began pacing up and down the room, pausing occasionally. 'I not consider it?
Recollections of home and of her children rose in her imagination with a new and peculiar charm.
He listened to what the steward had to say and questioned him, but only consented when the things to be ordered or built were the latest, as yet unknown in Russia, and likely to astonish people.
The Marshal of the Nobility rose and with tears in his eyes thanked the Nobility for their confidence.
He waited for the venomous nobleman to conclude, and then said he considered the proper course would be to consult the wording of the Act and requested the Secretary to look it up.
Every one who is a nobleman will understand... We shed our blood...
He began pacing up and down the room, watching the waiters with pleasure.
'That depends on each man's convictions,' he said severely.
'All Russia has assembled here: Chamberlains and almost Ministers.' He pointed to the portly figure of Oblonsky in his Chamberlain's uniform with white trousers, walking beside a General.
The Secretary knocked, the door opened and two landowners with flushed faces plunged out past Levin.
Everything, including the splendid dinner and the wines – which did not come from Russian merchants but were imported ready-bottled from abroad – was very distinguished, simple, and gay.
Even the Princess Barbara, who was playing patience, confirmed this, and Anna, flushing, rose, but instead of going downstairs, as she had already done twice, she stood still.
An event even occurred of great importance to them both in this respect, namely, Kitty's meeting with Vronsky.
When he had heard all, down to the fact that just for the first second she could not help blushing, but that afterwards she had felt as natural and easy as with anyone she might happen to meet, he became quite happy and said he was very glad it had happened and in future he would not behave as stupidly as he had done at the election, but would try to be as friendly as possible with Vronsky next time he met him.
Though he had to admit that in the Eastern and greater part of Russia rents were still nil, that wages – for nine-tenths of the eighty millions of the Russian population – represented only sustenance for themselves, and that capital did not yet exist except in the form of most primitive tools yet he regarded every labourer merely from that one point of view, though on many points he disagreed with the economists and had his own theory of wages, which he explained to Levin.
He rose and pushed forward a rocking-chair. 'Have you read the last circular in the Journal de St Petersbourg?
Every one rose, began to walk about, and to talk.
'Cordelia appears... here!' said Pestsov, tapping with his fingers the glossy programme he was holding, and handing it to Levin.
At length, having mentioned the folle journée [Mad fête.] that was being got up at Tyurin's, he laughed, rose noisily, and went away.
There was a pause, and the mother exchanged glances with her daughter.
'Well, I expect it's time now,' thought Levin, and rose.
Levin rose and went with him to a large table on which stood various kinds of vodka and a very varied assortment of hors d'oeuvres.
Levin went to the table, paid the forty roubles he had lost betting on the aces, paid the club bill to an old footman who stood by the door and who seemed in some miraculous way to know what it came to, and, swinging his arms in a peculiar way, passed through the whole suite of rooms to the exit.
The carriage drove up and they got in.
Levin did not now speak at all in the matter-of-fact way in which he had talked that morning.
The child rose and went out.
However, won't you come and have some tea?' She rose and took up a book bound in morocco-leather.
He listened and talked, and all the time thought of her, of her inner life, trying to guess her feelings.
But on the other side of the partition a light was moving, and he heard her step.
Having learnt that the doctor was not up yet, Levin, out of the many plans that occurred to him, decided on the following: Kuzma should go with a note to another doctor, while he himself would go to the chemist for the opium; and if the doctor was not up when he returned he would bribe the footman – or if that was impossible, he would enter by force and wake the doctor at all costs.
From the moment when he woke up and understood what was the matter Levin had braced himself to endure what might await him, without reasoning and without anticipating anything – firmly suppressing all his thoughts and feelings, determined not to upset his wife but on the contrary to calm and support her.
And every time when the screams that came from the bedroom roused him from momentary forgetfulness he succumbed to the same strange error that had possessed him in the first moments: every time, on hearing the scream, he jumped up and ran to justify himself, but recollected on the way that he was not to blame and that he longed to protect and help her.
When the baby had been swaddled and made into a firm doll, Mary Vlasevna turned it over as if proud of her work, and stepped aside that Levin might see his son in all his beauty.
'Oh, by the way!' said Oblonsky, 'I wanted to ask you to take an opportunity, when you see Pomorsky, to put in a word for me, and to tell him that I should very much like to get the vacant post of Member of the Committee of the Joint Agency of the Mutual Credit Balance of Southern Railways.' The name of the post that was so near his heart was already familiar to Oblonsky and he pronounced it rapidly without any blunder.
This is an abuse important in itself, which has a bad effect on the State service.
The lad looked healthy and bright.
I returned to Russia and had to be with my wife, and in the country besides, and in a fortnight I took to a dressing-gown and gave up dressing for dinner!
Landau hurriedly looked round, approached smilingly, laid upon Oblonsky's outstretched hand his own moist and motionless one, went back, and continued looking at the portraits.
'Yes, a misfortune which has turned into a great blessing, because his heart became new and is filled with Him,' she said, glancing at Oblonsky with lovesick eyes.
Landau rose and came up to them.
Karenin and Lydia Ivanovna exchanged significant looks, and the reading began.
Karenin rose, and though he tried to be cautious he caught against the table.
'You know yourself?' said she, and at the same moment, unable to restrain herself any longer, she burst into tears.
Voytov, who was buying a horse from Vronsky, arrived, and Anna rose and left the room.
'If it's nothing, then tant pis!' he thought, again chilled. Turning away, he went out.
If not, it means that all is over, and then I will decide what I am to do...!
Suddenly the shadow of the screen began to move and spread over the whole of the cornice, the whole ceiling. Other shadows rushed toward it from another side; for an instant they rushed together, but then again they spread with renewed swiftness, flickered, and all was darkness.
But he did not return to her; he only gave an order that they should let Voytov have the horse in his absence.
IS IT FINISHED?' said Anna to herself as she stood by the window; and in answer to that question, the impressions left by the darkness when her candle went out and by the terrible dream, merging into one, filled her heart with icy horror.
Twelve minutes had passed. 'Now he has received my note and is on his way back.
'A quarter of an hour there, a quarter of an hour back; he is already on the way, he will be here in a minute.' She looked at her watch.
'Yes, I will go,' said Anna, recovering and rousing herself; 'and if a telegram comes during my absence, send it to Darya Alexandrovna's...
She reproached herself now with the humiliation to which she had descended. 'I entreated him to forgive me.
The zest is gone!' she said to herself in English. 'That man wants to astonish everybody and is very well satisfied with himself,' she thought, glancing at a rosy-faced shop-assistant who was riding a hired horse.
He devoted himself completely to the service of that great movement and forgot to think about his book.
'No, Princess, I am going to my brother's for a rest.
They are both going.
For a moment Oblonsky's face looked sad, but a minute later when, with a slight spring in his step and smoothing his whiskers, he entered the waiting-room where Vronsky was, Oblonsky had quite forgotten how he had sobbed with despair over his sister's corpse, and he saw in Vronsky only a hero and an old friend.
The nurse stopped waving the branch and began to doze.
SINCE THE MOMENT when, at the sight of his beloved and dying brother, Levin for the first time looked at the questions of life and death in the light of the new convictions, as he called them, which between the ages of twenty and thirty-four had imperceptibly replaced the beliefs of his childhood and youth, he had been less horrified by death than by life without the least knowledge of whence it came, what it is for, why, and what it is.
But he did not hang or shoot himself and went on living.
When he returned to the country in June, he went back to his ordinary occupations – husbandry, intercourse with the peasants and with his neighbours, management of his house and of his sister's and brother's affairs, which were entrusted to him, relations with his wife and relatives, cares about his baby, and a new hobby – beekeeping, which he took up with enthusiasm that spring – occupied all his time.
'The rent is too high, Constantine Dmitrich,' answered Theodore, picking out the ears of rye from the front of his damp shirt.
'That is like him,' said Levin. 'But are Volunteers really still going?' he added with a glance at Koznyshev.
Imagine that you were going along a street and saw a tipsy man beating a woman or a child; I think you would not stop to ask whether war had or had not been declared against that man, but you would rush at him and defend the victim!'
Not to mention the undercurrents that have stirred in the motionless sea of the nation and which are evident to every unprejudiced person, look at Society in the narrower sense!
'No, I must not dispute with them,' he thought. 'They are clad in impenetrable armour, and I am naked.'
The wind. obstinately, as if insisting on having its way, pushed Levin back and, tearing the leaves and blossoms off the lime trees and rudely and strangely uncovering the white branches of birches, bent everything in one direction: the acacias, the flowers, the dock leaves, the grass, and the crests of the trees.
Kitty's wet and rosy face was turned to him, timidly smiling beneath her bedraggled hat.
Kitty brightened up with a smile.
The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger. The lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and disappeared over it.
Ben stopped nibbling his apple.
Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth--stepped back to note the effect--added a touch here and there--criticised the effect again--Ben watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more absorbed.
But Sid's fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and broke.
Then he thought of his flower.
The window went up, a maid-servant's discordant voice profaned the holy calm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr's remains!
At the door Tom dropped back a step and accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade: "Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?"
However, they worried through, and each got his reward--in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture on it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation.
Mr. Walters' heart sank within him.
Then there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so did the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of light.
Tom was panting with his exertions by this time.
Sid snored on.
The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe.
Open your mouth.
"Well, I reckon it's so, then.
"Come up here.
The boy worked on, apparently unconscious.
So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up.
So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin.
He sat long with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating.
Have at thee!"
Then he shot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle and sprang up too gaily for a corpse.
The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss.
"If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!" whispered Tom, in short catches between breaths.
It was deep, and dark, and awful; the hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it.
The howling stopped.
He undressed with excessive caution, and fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade.
The poor fellow's face was haggard, and his eyes showed the fear that was upon him.
He saw Injun Joe, and exclaimed:
Sid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries, though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises; he noticed, too, that Tom never acted as a witness--and that was strange; and Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even showed a marked aversion to these inquests, and always avoided them when he could.
She began to try all manner of remedies on him.
Tom winced, and dropped his eyes.
By this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for school to "take up" tinkled faintly upon his ear.
"You see," said Tom, "people don't go much on hermits, nowadays, like they used to in old times, but a pirate's always respected.
"Run away!
Gradually the cool dim gray of the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life manifested itself.
They discovered that the island was about three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards wide.
They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town.
Presently a revealing thought flashed through Tom's mind, and he exclaimed:
Here was a gorgeous triumph; they were missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account; tears were being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor lost lads were rising up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being indulged; and best of all, the departed were the talk of the whole town, and the envy of all the boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety was concerned.
He began to have a nobler opinion of himself than ever before.
Aunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so appealingly, and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice, that he was weltering in tears again, long before she was through.
Now the boy stole out, rose gradually by the bedside, shaded the candle-light with his hand, and stood regarding her.
He's up to something or other.
Then Tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon, and the other pirates got ready to fish and explore.
He glanced at Huck.
Huck began to pick up his scattered clothes.
The lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will, chattering all the time about Tom's stupendous plan and admiring the genius of it.
They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had been built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from the ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they patiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under sides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again.
"Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the bed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him."
And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and wrote on a piece of sycamore bark, 'We ain't dead--we are only off being pirates,' and put it on the table by the candle; and then you looked so good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned over and kissed you on the lips."
I'm thankful to the good God and Father of us all I've got you back, that's long-suffering and merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word, though goodness knows I'm unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His blessings and had His hand to help them over the rough places, there's few enough would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long night comes. Go 'long Sid, Mary, Tom--take yourselves off--you've hendered me long enough."
They began to tell their adventures to hungry listeners--but they only began; it was not a thing likely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish material.
Amy chatted happily along, as they walked, for her heart was singing, but Tom's tongue had lost its function.
Amy's happy prattle became intolerable.
I don't care for them!" and burst into tears, and got up and walked away.
Tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple; for with shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not forgetting her own treachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way, soon, to pleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with Becky's latest words lingering dreamily in his ear--
A very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited, "You'd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage," etc.--accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic gestures which a machine might have used--supposing the machine to be a trifle out of order.
Two men entered.
The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had bushy white whiskers; long white hair flowed from under his sombrero, and he wore green goggles.
When they came in, "t'other" was talking in a low voice; they sat down on the ground, facing the door, with their backs to the wall, and the speaker continued his remarks.
Tom urged--Huck held back.
"Good idea," said the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt down, raised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag that jingled pleasantly.
He ran and brought the boys' pick and shovel.
Tom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the towel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern. Huck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley.
Just as they got within its shelter the storm burst and the rain poured down.
Well, without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and open comes the door!
I hopped in, and shook off the towel, and, _Great Caesar's Ghost!_"
The day was completed and crowned in a peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint the next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she consented.
The mouth of the cave was up the hillside--an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood unbarred.
If you flinch, I'll kill you. Do you understand that?
"Well, poor chap, you do look as if you'd had a hard night of it--but there's a bed here for you when you've had your breakfast.
Why, what's the _matter_ with you?" Huck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful.
They smoked their own names under an overhanging shelf and moved on.
She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom was appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason.
The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing into his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and dreamy memories.
They rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless.
A frightened look in Becky's face brought Tom to his senses and he saw that he had made a blunder.
Tom got down on his knees and felt below, and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands conveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the right, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding a candle, appeared from behind a rock!
Tom lifted up a glorious shout, and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to--Injun Joe's!
He proposed to explore another passage.
If you drove them out they'd turn right around and come back. It's so in all the books."
It would hang round the money.
The point was well taken. It had its effect.
He proposed to explore. He stooped and passed under; the narrow way descended gradually.
He disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two small sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started off, dragging his cargo behind him.
