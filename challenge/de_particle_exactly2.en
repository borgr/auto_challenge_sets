I mounted into the window- seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement.
"I want you to come here;" and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.
Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would presently deal it.
Won't I tell mama? but first--" He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had closed with a desperate thing.
Then Mrs. Reed subjoined--
"Mind you don't," said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as incredulous of my sanity.
"Unjust!--unjust!" said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up, instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable oppression--as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.
"Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am," pleaded Bessie.
I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took it, smiling and saying, "We shall do very well by-and-by."
Then he laid me down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I was not disturbed during the night.
Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep.
"The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?" pursued Mr. Lloyd when Bessie was gone.
Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they can help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle,--so cruel that I think I shall never forget it."
Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced--
"Little darling!--with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour as she has; just as if she were painted!--Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh rabbit for supper."
Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned against him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to desist, and ran from me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose.
"What?" said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm, and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child or fiend.
Bessie supplied the hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she proved beyond a doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a roof.
I then sat with my doll on my knee till the fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might, and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.
It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of sensation.
It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in the morning: Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not less so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she thus obtained.
Having spread the quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in order some picture-books and doll's house furniture scattered there; an abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard frost.
I gave another tug before I answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied--
You look quite red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the window for?"
Presently he addressed me--"Your name, little girl?"
Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down on the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far enough away.
"Do you say your prayers night and morning?" continued my interrogator.
"Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a tendency to deceit.
"I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects," continued my benefactress; "to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at Lowood."
"Child! what do you mean?
Raw and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down the drive.
We passed through several towns, and in one, a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the passengers alighted to dine.
At last the guard returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the "stony street" of L-.
I answered "Yes," and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach instantly drove away.
"She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?" she asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.
"Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!"
Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered the books and removed them.
A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each walked to a table and took her seat.
I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the teachers--none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather-beaten, and over-worked--when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.
In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and I said to her directly--
The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight; but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen.
I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would praise her attention; but, instead of that, she suddenly cried out--
"Hardened girl!" exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; "nothing can correct you of your slatternly habits: carry the rod away."
"I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland."
I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the forbearance she expressed for her chastiser.
"Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and civilised nations disown it."
Helen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this sentence.
Miss Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble, appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material; especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor's chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified severity.
Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and when the first class could take in what was required of them, they obeyed.
Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching figure, which we at once recognised as Miss Temple.
And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, "Fortunately, I have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once."
"My things were indeed in shameful disorder," murmured Helen to me, in a low voice: "I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot."
After a long silence, she resumed, still whispering--
Feverish with vain labour, I got up and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two, shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.
There still remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.
"You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout," continued Mrs. Leaven.
"No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as a child."
"So he went?"
I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the "boots" placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced, and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to Thornfield.
I bethought myself to ring the bell.
He vanished, but reappeared instantly--
I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging by the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude, much larger than Lowton.
"You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now."
About ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we passed through, and they clashed to behind us.
A great many gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them, or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it.
Descending from her chair, she came and placed herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her, shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced singing a song from some opera.
Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry, biography, travels, a few romances, &c.
I then proposed to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her use.
When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I went; for all was well arranged and handsome.
Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by drift of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the narrow garret staircase.
"She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid's work," continued the widow; "not altogether unobjectionable in some points, but she does well enough.
"Mesdames, vous etes servies!" adding, "J'ai bien faim, moi!"
On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees, sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile distant, but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life.
The dog came bounding back, and seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to his magnitude.
I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I now drew near him again.
He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned his eyes in my direction before.
The traveller waited and watched for some time, and at last he laughed.
It was so like it that I went forward and said--"Pilot" and the thing got up and came to me and snuffed me.
"What dog is this?"
Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went to bed early that night; nor did he rise soon next morning.
Left alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence: twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very shrubs on the lawn.
In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts that were beginning to throng on my solitude.
He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved.
"Well," resumed Mr. Rochester, "if you disown parents, you must have some sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?"
The widow looked bewildered.
Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio: we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.
Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed--
"Now I have performed the part of a good host," pursued Mr. Rochester, "put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at liberty to attend to my own pleasure.
"I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint.
It was one afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and while she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and down a long beech avenue within sight of her.
The balcony was furnished with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,--I will take one now, if you will excuse me."
"'I will like it,' said I; 'I dare like it;' and" (he subjoined moodily) "I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to goodness--yes, goodness.
After this digression he proceeded--
The couple were thus revealed to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was 'the Varens,' shining in satin and jewels,--my gifts of course,--and there was her companion in an officer's uniform; and I knew him for a young roue of a vicomte--a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so absolutely.
All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen- door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up to the threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen him lying there myself in the mornings.
He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.
If you are not warm enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in the arm-chair: there,--I will put it on.
I shall take the candle. Remain where you are till I return; be as still as a mouse.
He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, them in both his own.
"Well, leave me:" he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.
I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep.
I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale, wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I could not reach it, even in fancy--a counteracting breeze blew off land, and continually drove me back.
"A strange affair!" I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her fixedly
Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to master's; but Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often sleep heavy."
Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and conscious eye.
He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing her?
She looked up with a sort of start. "Qu' avez-vous, mademoiselle?" said she.
I listened for the bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and I turned to the door, expecting it to open and admit him.
I never saw a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram was certainly the queen."
I went on with my day's business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.
And while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face.
"Miss Ingram!" exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post below.
"Some natural tears she shed" on being told this; but as I began to look very grave, she consented at last to wipe them.
The solo over, a duet followed, and then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals.
"No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea.
I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress: there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.
I rose and curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only stared at me.
He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter.
The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up at him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does Mr. Rochester.
Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.
I feared--or should I say, hoped?--the allusion to me would make Mr. Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the shade: but he never turned his eyes.
Then, in a lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, "I noticed her; I am a judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class."
"Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict a chastisement beyond mortal endurance."
I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out; rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr. Rochester.
He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I had been fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got loose.
Colonel Dent, their spokesman, demanded "the tableau of the whole;" whereupon the curtain again descended.
"Bridewell!" exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.
I have seen in his face a far different expression from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him; but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it--to answer what he asked without pretension, to address him when needful without grimace--and it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a fostering sunbeam.
The Ladies Lynn and Ingram continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets.
"How provoking!" exclaimed Miss Ingram: "you tiresome monkey!" (apostrophising Adele), "who perched you up in the window to give false intelligence?" and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault.
Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.
For a handsome and not an unamiable-looking man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power in that smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that aquiline nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low, even forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.
"Surely, colonel," cried Lady Ingram, "you would not encourage such a low impostor?
The footman still lingered. "She looks such a rough one," said he.
"She says, sir, that she'll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble themselves to come near her; nor," he added, with difficulty suppressing a titter, "any ladies either, except the young, and single."
All eyes met her with a glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to her seat, and took it in silence.
"If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she will not go till she has seen all.
The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl--if Sibyl she were--was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney- corner.
She shut her book and slowly looked up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as she raised it, that it was a strange one.
I have scarcely interchanged a syllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young, dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are all at liberty to be the recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me."
"A profound remark! A most ingenious quibble! He went to Millcote this morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that circumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance--blot him, as it were, out of existence?"
It depends on yourself to stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you will do so, is the problem I study.
I did not wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I had left it.
I dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies.
I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it to Mason.
Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs; unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you will see in the yard--or just outside, for I told him not to drive his rattling wheels over the pavement--to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane, if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem."
I, supposing he had done with me, prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call "Jane!"
Mind, I don't say a _crime_; I am not speaking of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is _error_.
He got up instantly, went quite to the other end of the walk, and when he came back he was humming a tune.
The information about Mr. John's death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.
"Does that person want you?" she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr. Rochester turned to see who the "person" was. He made a curious grimace--one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations--threw down his cue and followed me from the room.
I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was. "Five shillings, sir."
I approached the bed; I opened the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.
And yet I stooped down and kissed her: she looked at me.
But unimpressionable natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily eradicated. Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather from me, she remarked that the night was warm.
Again she regarded me so icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me--her feeling towards me--was unchanged and unchangeable.
But there was something I wished to say--let me see--" The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place in her once vigorous frame.
"Stop!" exclaimed Mrs. Reed, "there is another thing I wished to say.
I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed and content.
One day, however, as she put away her account-book and unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus--
I now gently assured her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.
She heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and drawn breath, she went on thus--
The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed.
And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I. Neither of us had dropt a tear.
Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make arrangements for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new carriage: she said the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed strange to her; but from what everybody said, and from what she had herself seen, she could no longer doubt that the event would shortly take place.
"It would be past the power of magic, sir;" and, in thought, I added, "A loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty."
I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr. Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to allege for leaving him.
"Very soon, my--that is, Miss Eyre: and you'll remember, Jane, the first time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to put my old bachelor's neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the holy estate of matrimony--to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short (she's an extensive armful: but that's not to the point--one can't have too much of such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche): well, as I was saying--listen to me, Jane!
"In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom," continued Mr. Rochester; "and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum for you."
I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking on the necessity of death."
"Yes, so, sir," I rejoined: "and yet not so; for you are a married man--or as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you--to one with whom you have no sympathy--whom I do not believe you truly love; for I have seen and heard you sneer at her.
None: as I have taken pains to prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the result; it was coldness both from her and her mother. I would not--I could not--marry Miss Ingram.
If you are true, and your offer real, my only feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion--they cannot torture."
"Gratitude!" he ejaculated; and added wildly--"Jane accept me quickly. Say, Edward--give me my name--Edward--I will marry you."
I only smiled at her, and ran upstairs.
"No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!" exclaimed I, nettled; "he is nothing like my father!
Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and- twenty."
"Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!" cried he to Adele.
He handed her over as if she had been a lapdog. "I'll send her to school yet," he said, but now he was smiling.
I told him in a new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and a silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his choice.
I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a speck of rain.
The cloven halves were not broken from each other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below; though community of vitality was destroyed--the sap could flow no more: their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter's tempests would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might be said to form one tree--a ruin, but an entire ruin.
Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples with which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I employed myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them into the house and put them away in the store-room.
The event of last night again recurred to me.
He saw me; for the moon had opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took his hat off, and waved it round his head.
As John took his horse, and he followed me into the hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on, and then return to him in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for the staircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long: nor was I long; in five minutes I rejoined him.
I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was ardent and flushed.
But presently she took my veil from its place; she held it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and turned to the mirror.
I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one: satisfied I was not, but to please him I endeavoured to appear so--relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him with a contented smile.
I remember Adele clung to me as I left her: I remember I kissed her as I loosened her little hands from my neck; and I cried over her with strange emotion, and quitted her because I feared my sobs would break her still sound repose.
"Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk are there: return and tell me."
"Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice."
We all withdrew.
He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage.
The house cleared, I shut myself in, fastened the bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded--not to weep, not to mourn, I was yet too calm for that, but--mechanically to take off the wedding dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn yesterday, as I thought, for the last time.
Suddenly he turned away, with an inarticulate exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he walked fast through the room and came back; he stooped towards me as if to kiss me; but I remembered caresses were now forbidden.
I turned my face away and put his aside.
"What!--How is this?" he exclaimed hastily. "Oh, I know! you won't kiss the husband of Bertha Mason?
He bared his wrist, and offered it to me: the blood was forsaking his cheek and lips, they were growing livid; I was distressed on all hands.
"Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?"
"A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the open casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the air grew pure. I then framed and fixed a resolution.
I have not done.
Adele claimed your outward attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and amused her a long time.
I wondered what you thought of me, or if you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out. "I resumed my notice of you.
I think you good, gifted, lovely: a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you, draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence about you, and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.
What then is left?
"Oh, comply!" it said. "Think of his misery; think of his danger--look at his state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the recklessness following on despair--soothe him; save him; love him; tell him you love him and will be his.
His fury was wrought to the highest: he must yield to it for a moment, whatever followed; he crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my waist.
As he said this, he released me from his clutch, and only looked at me.
Up the blood rushed to his face; forth flashed the fire from his eyes; erect he sprang; he held his arms out; but I evaded the embrace, and at once quitted the room.
It gazed and gazed on me.
The other articles I made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings (it was all I had), I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl, took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole from my room. "Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!"
Human life and human labour were near.
I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves, the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd.
I felt sorely urged to weep; but conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained it.
She looked at me with evident suspicion: "Nay, she never sold stuff i' that way."
I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the wood I have before alluded to. But my night was wretched, my rest broken: the ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed near me more than once, and I had again and again to change my quarters; no sense of safety or tranquillity befriended me.
"Mother!" she exclaimed, "there is a woman wants me to give her these porridge."
I put out my hand to feel the dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall--above it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge.
This scene was as silent as if all the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the click-click of the woman's knitting-needles.
You should not be roving about now; it looks very ill."
These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there--dumb and still.
"Yes--yes; open quickly."
"She does look white," said Hannah.
The traces of the bog were removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite decent.
I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness--
You look a raight down dacent little crater."
"Besides, the fire is too hot for you," interposed Mary.
"To be sure," added her sister.
I am but the incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort.
I soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my present strength would permit.
"Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and you to accept."
"Well?" I said, as he again paused--"proceed."
Standing still, he again looked at me.
He folded the letter, locked it in his desk, and again went out.
Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted in anger, and were never reconciled.
Perfect beauty is a strong expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet features as ever the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as ever her humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified, in this instance, the term.
"Papa says you never come to see us now," continued Miss Oliver, looking up. "You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall.
She turned twice to gaze after him as she tripped fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across, never turned at all.
There was an enjoyment in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a consideration--a scrupulous regard to their feelings--to which they were not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.
While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of "Marmion" (for "Marmion" it was), St. John stooped to examine my drawing.
I looked up at him: he shunned my eye.
"Oh, that is nothing yet," I muttered within. "I don't mean to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I'm prepared to go to considerable lengths."
He now furtively raised his eyes: he glanced at me, irresolute, disturbed: he again surveyed the picture.
Amidst this hush the quartet sped; he replaced the watch, laid the picture down, rose, and stood on the hearth.
I gazed at him in wonder.
I pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon forgot it.
"You unbend your forehead at last," said Mr. Rivers. "I thought Medusa had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone.
Mr. Rivers rose now and put his cloak on.
He was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.
"You think so now," rejoined St. John, "because you do not know what it is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a notion of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the place it would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would open to you: you cannot--"
He looked grave. "What now?
I looked at him with surprise.
He is right to choose a missionary's career--I see it now."
But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without one objection, one murmur, he departed.
It was then nine o'clock: he did not return till midnight.
He wanted to train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to aspire to the standard he uplifted.
Put on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment."
Do you not see it, Jane?
He looked at me fixedly, compressing his well-cut lips while he did so.
He has told me I am formed for labour--not for love: which is true, no doubt.
"My prayers are heard!" ejaculated St. John.
I filled the interval in walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had given my plans their present bent.
All is still: he again advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of beauty--warm, and blooming, and lovely, in rest.
I suppose you are a stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last autumn,--Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about harvest-time.
And then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own eyes.
It opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel whether it rained.
I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him--to examine him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible.
I asked John to go down to the turn- pike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring my trunk, which I had left there: and then, while I removed my bonnet and shawl, I questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the Manor House for the night; and finding that arrangements to that effect, though difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I should stay.
"I don't think he will see you," she answered; "he refuses everybody."
Pilot pricked up his ears when I came in: then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and bounded towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my hands.
I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting John's wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear."
"It is a bright, sunny morning, sir," I said. "The rain is over and gone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk soon."
But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed off the salt drops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast.
"Shake me off, then, sir,--push me away, for I'll not leave you of my own accord."
"That depends on circumstances, sir--on your choice."
I kept these things then, and pondered them in my heart.
"You cannot now wonder," continued my master, "that when you rose upon me so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any other than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted before.
He informed me then, that for some time he had fancied the obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was sure of it.
I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
Presently she began again. 'I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth!
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
I almost think I can remember feeling a little different.
Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, 'I do wish they would put their heads down!
'I must be growing small again.' She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.
'Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; 'I daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.' (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.)
'I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. 'Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'
'I thought you did,' said the Mouse. '--I proceed. "Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it
Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.
'You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice, 'and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.
She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.
And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: '"Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!"
She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself 'That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so much!'
She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.
'I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; 'but those serpents!
'Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, 'it'll never do to come upon them this size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.
For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles.
'There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went on without attending to her, 'if we had the door between us. For instance, if you were inside, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.'
At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.
'Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately: 'he's perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.
The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.
'I do,' Alice hastily replied; 'at least--at least I mean what I say--that's the same thing, you know.'
'You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, 'that "I like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'
'You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, 'that "I breathe when I sleep" is the same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!'
The Hatter was the first to break the silence. 'What day of the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.
For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!'
'It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, 'in this way:--
'And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, 'or you'll be asleep again before it's done.'
This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.
Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say, 'Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me like that!'
'That's none of your business, Two!' said Seven.
Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun 'Well, of all the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.
Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.
'And who are these?' said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.
'She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little scream of laughter.
The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it would twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.
'A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. 'I've read that in some book, but I don't remember where.'
'Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, 'My dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!'
It doesn't look like one, but it is.'
'I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: 'sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.'
'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.
'Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.
'Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, 'if you don't know what to uglify is, you are a simpleton.'
'And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.
'Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: 'advance twice, set to partners--' '--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the Gryphon.
So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:
Alice was thoroughly puzzled. 'Does the boots and shoes!' she repeated in a wondering tone.
Tell her to begin.' He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.
'Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the Gryphon went on. 'Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?'
In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--'I wish they'd get the trial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the refreshments!' But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time.
'They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in reply, 'for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.'
'Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, 'Silence in the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking.
'Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.
The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. 'Fourteenth of March, I think it was,' he said.
'Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse: 'not in that ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court.
'I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, 'and most things twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'
'Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.
'After that,' continued the Hatter, 'I cut some more bread- and-butter--'
'If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,' continued the King.
'Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. 'Behead that Dormouse!
And he added in an undertone to the Queen, 'Really, my dear, you must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!'
'You are,' said the King. 'Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.
The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. 'Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. 'Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?' he asked.
Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.
We were in class when the head-master came in, followed by a "new fellow," not wearing the school uniform, and a school servant carrying a large desk. Those who had been asleep woke up, and every one rose as if just surprised at his work.
The head-master made a sign to us to sit down.
Although he was not broad-shouldered, his short school jacket of green cloth with black buttons must have been tight about the arm-holes, and showed at the opening of the cuffs red wrists accustomed to being bare.
For two hundred francs a year he managed to live on the border of the provinces of Caux and Picardy, in a kind of place half farm, half private house; and here, soured, eaten up with regrets, cursing his luck, jealous of everyone, he shut himself up at the age of forty-five, sick of men, he said, and determined to live at peace.
But, peaceable by nature, the lad answered only poorly to his notions.
Six months more passed, and the year after Charles was finally sent to school at Rouen, where his father took him towards the end of October, at the time of the St. Romain fair.
He grew thin, his figure became taller, his face took a saddened look that made it nearly interesting.
When Charles returned in the evening, she stretched forth two long thin arms from beneath the sheets, put them round his neck, and having made him sit down on the edge of the bed, began to talk to him of her troubles: he was neglecting her, he loved another.
The servant opened the garret-window and parleyed for some time with a man in the street below.
Natasie came downstairs shivering and undid the bars and bolts one after the other.
Madame in modesty had turned to the wall and showed only her back.
It was a dark night; Madame Bovary junior was afraid of accidents for her husband.
In order to make some splints a bundle of laths was brought up from the cart-house.
Charles selected one, cut it into two pieces and planed it with a fragment of windowpane, while the servant tore up sheets to make bandages, and Mademoiselle Emma tried to sew some pads.
As she was a long time before she found her work-case, her father grew impatient; she did not answer, but as she sewed she pricked her fingers, which she then put to her mouth to suck them.
Although brown, they seemed black because of the lashes, and her look came at you frankly, with a candid boldness.
As to Charles, he did not stop to ask himself why it was a pleasure to him to go to the Bertaux. Had he done so, he would, no doubt, have attributed his zeal to the importance of the case, or perhaps to the money he hoped to make by it. Was it for this, however, that his visits to the farm formed a delightful exception to the meagre occupations of his life? On these days he rose early, set off at a gallop, urging on his horse, then got down to wipe his boots in the grass and put on black gloves before entering. He liked going into the courtyard, and noticing the gate turn against his shoulder, the cock crow on the wall, the lads run to meet him. He liked the granary and the stables; he liked old Rouault, who pressed his hand and called him his saviour; he like the small wooden shoes of Mademoiselle Emma on the scoured flags of the kitchen—her high heels made her a little taller; and when she walked in front of him, the wooden soles springing up quickly struck with a sharp sound against the leather of her boots.
The matter had to be gone into. The house at Dieppe was found to be eaten up with mortgages to its foundations; what she had placed with the notary God only knew, and her share in the boat did not exceed one thousand crowns.
He had an aimless hope, and was vaguely happy; he thought himself better looking as he brushed his whiskers before the looking-glass.
Between the window and the hearth Emma was sewing; she wore no fichu; he could see small drops of perspiration on her bare shoulders.
So she went to fetch a bottle of curacao from the cupboard, reached down two small glasses, filled one to the brim, poured scarcely anything into the other, and, after having clinked glasses, carried hers to her mouth.
Old Rouault would not have been sorry to be rid of his daughter, who was of no use to him in the house.
Far from having made a fortune by it, the good man was losing every year; for if he was good in bargaining, in which he enjoyed the dodges of the trade, on the other hand, agriculture properly so called, and the internal management of the farm, suited him less than most people.
They stopped.
"I ask nothing better", the farmer went on. "Although, no doubt, the little one is of my mind, still we must ask her opinion.
The guests arrived early in carriages, in one-horse chaises, two-wheeled cars, old open gigs, waggonettes with leather hoods, and the young people from the nearer villages in carts, in which they stood up in rows, holding on to the sides so as not to fall, going at a trot and well shaken up.
The other wedding guests talked of their business or played tricks behind each other's backs, egging one another on in advance to be jolly.
At night when they left, the horses, stuffed up to the nostrils with oats, could hardly be got into the shafts; they kicked, reared, the harness broke, their masters laughed or swore; and all night in the light of the moon along country roads there were runaway carts at full gallop plunging into the ditches, jumping over yard after yard of stones, clambering up the hills, with women leaning out from the tilt to catch hold of the reins.
Madame Bovary, senior, had not opened her mouth all day. She had been consulted neither as to the dress of her daughter-in-law nor as to the arrangement of the feast; she went to bed early. Her husband, instead of following her, sent to Saint-Victor for some cigars, and smoked till daybreak, drinking kirsch-punch, a mixture unknown to the company. This added greatly to the consideration in which he was held.
Charles, who was not of a facetious turn, did not shine at the wedding.
The next day, on the other hand, he seemed another man. It was he who might rather have been taken for the virgin of the evening before, whilst the bride gave no sign that revealed anything. The shrewdest did not know what to make of it, and they looked at her when she passed near them with an unbounded concentration of mind. But Charles concealed nothing. He called her "my wife", tutoyed* her, asked for her of everyone, looked for her everywhere, and often he dragged her into the yards, where he could be seen from far between the trees, putting his arm around her waist, and walking half-bending over her, ruffling the chemisette of her bodice with his head.
Two days after the wedding the married pair left. Charles, on account of his patients, could not be away longer.
This nature, positive in the midst of its enthusiasms, that had loved the church for the sake of the flowers, and music for the words of the songs, and literature for its passional stimulus, rebelled against the mysteries of faith as it grew irritated by discipline, a thing antipathetic to her constitution. When her father took her from school, no one was sorry to see her go.
Emma, on the other hand, knew how to look after her house. She sent the patients' accounts in well-phrased letters that had no suggestion of a bill. When they had a neighbour to dinner on Sundays, she managed to have some tasty dish—piled up pyramids of greengages on vine leaves, served up preserves turned out into plates—and even spoke of buying finger-glasses for dessert. From all this much consideration was extended to Bovary.
She went as far as the beeches of Banneville, near the deserted pavilion which forms an angle of the wall on the side of the country. Amidst the vegetation of the ditch there are long reeds with leaves that cut you.
She found again in the same places the foxgloves and wallflowers, the beds of nettles growing round the big stones, and the patches of lichen along the three windows, whose shutters, always closed, were rotting away on their rusty iron bars.
In town, with the noise of the streets, the buzz of the theatres and the lights of the ballroom, they were living lives where the heart expands, the senses bourgeon out.
The chateau, a modern building in Italian style, with two projecting wings and three flights of steps, lay at the foot of an immense green-sward, on which some cows were grazing among groups of large trees set out at regular intervals, while large beds of arbutus, rhododendron, syringas, and guelder roses bulged out their irregular clusters of green along the curve of the gravel path. A river flowed under a bridge; through the mist one could distinguish buildings with thatched roofs scattered over the field bordered by two gently sloping, well timbered hillocks, and in the background amid the trees rose in two parallel lines the coach houses and stables, all that was left of the ruined old chateau.
And on another: "Jean-Antoine-Henry-Guy d'Andervilliers de la Vaubyessard, Admiral of France and Chevalier of the Order of St. Michael, wounded at the battle of the Hougue-Saint-Vaast on the 29th of May, 1692; died at Vaubyessard on the 23rd of January 1693." One could hardly make out those that followed, for the light of the lamps lowered over the green cloth threw a dim shadow round the room.
The loose reins hanging over his crupper were wet with foam, and the box fastened on behind the chaise gave great regular bumps against it.
Charles, seated opposite Emma, rubbed his hands gleefully.
He smoked with lips protruding, spitting every moment, recoiling at every puff.
He put down his cigar and ran to swallow a glass of cold water at the pump.
She looked at it, opened it, and even smelt the odour of the lining—a mixture of verbena and tobacco.
To replace Nastasie (who left Tostes shedding torrents of tears) Emma took into her service a young girl of fourteen, an orphan with a sweet face. She forbade her wearing cotton caps, taught her to address her in the third person, to bring a glass of water on a plate, to knock before coming into a room, to iron, starch, and to dress her—wanted to make a lady's-maid of her. The new servant obeyed without a murmur, so as not to be sent away; and as madame usually left the key in the sideboard, Felicite every evening took a small supply of sugar that she ate alone in her bed after she had said her prayers.
Sometimes Emma tucked the red borders of his under-vest unto his waistcoat, rearranged his cravat, and threw away the dirty gloves he was going to put on; and this was not, as he fancied, for himself; it was for herself, by a diffusion of egotism, of nervous irritation.
Who would hear her?
She watched him going.
Often she persisted in not going out, then, stifling, threw open the windows and put on light dresses.
As she was constantly complaining about Tostes, Charles fancied that her illness was no doubt due to some local cause, and fixing on this idea, began to think seriously of setting up elsewhere.
The little pasteboard berries burst, the wire twisted, the gold lace melted; and the shriveled paper corollas, fluttering like black butterflies at the back of the stove, at least flew up the chimney.
He went to the small parlour, but the three millers had to be got out first, and during the whole time necessary for laying the cloth, Binet remained silent in his place near the stove.
"Yet they say he has parts," objected the landlady.
"Oh, I adore the sea!" said Monsieur Leon.
"And then, does it not seem to you," continued Madame Bovary, "that the mind travels more freely on this limitless expanse, the contemplation of which elevates the soul, gives ideas of the infinite, the ideal?"
"Ah! don't you listen to him, Madame Bovary," interrupted Homais, bending over his plate.
Madame Homais, as well as Madame Lefrancois of the Lion d'Or, almost immediately came running in to embrace her.
They ran over the calendar from end to end, and then consulted outsiders.
At last Emma remembered that at the chateau of Vaubyessard she had heard the Marchioness call a young lady Berthe; from that moment this name was chosen; and as old Rouault could not come, Monsieur Homais was requested to stand godfather.
He came to greet her, and stood in the shade in front of the Lheureux's shop under the projecting grey awning.
Through openings in the hedges one could see into the huts, some pigs on a dung-heap, or tethered cows rubbing their horns against the trunk of trees.
The room on the ground-floor, the only one in the dwelling, had at its farther end, against the wall, a large bed without curtains, while a kneading-trough took up the side by the window, one pane of which was mended with a piece of blue paper.
Leon walked up and down the room; it seemed strange to him to see this beautiful woman in her nankeen dress in the midst of all this poverty. Madam Bovary reddened; he turned away, thinking perhaps there had been an impertinent look in his eyes. Then she put back the little girl, who had just been sick over her collar.
"Well," the nurse went on, heaving sighs between each word, "I'm afraid he'll be put out seeing me have coffee alone, you know men—"
"Well," the latter continued, making a curtsey, "if it weren't asking too much," and she curtsied once more, "if you would"—and her eyes begged—"a jar of brandy," she said at last, "and I'd rub your little one's feet with it; they're as tender as one's tongue."
He thought he was to be pitied for living in this village, with Homais for a friend and Monsieru Guillaumin for master. The latter, entirely absorbed by his business, wearing gold-rimmed spectacles and red whiskers over a white cravat, understood nothing of mental refinements, although he affected a stiff English manner, which in the beginning had impressed the clerk.
Twice a day Leon went from his office to the Lion d'Or.
Emma could hear him coming from afar; she leant forward listening, and the young man glided past the curtain, always dressed in the same way, and without turning his head.
Skull-cap in hand, he came in on tiptoe, in order to disturb no one, always repeating the same phrase, "Good evening, everybody." Then, when he had taken his seat at the table between the pair, he asked the doctor about his patients, and the latter consulted his as to the probability of their payment.
The clerk never failed to be there.
Leon stopped, pointing with a gesture to his sleeping audience; then they talked in low tones, and their conversation seemed the more sweet to them because it was unheard.
They decided that she must be his lover.
She turned.
But a knife was wanted; Charles offered his.
What was certain was that he made complex calculations in his head that would have frightened Binet himself.
She reflected for a few moments, and ended by again declining Monsieur Lheureux's offer. He replied quite unconcernedly—
She was so sad, so sad, to see her standing upright on the threshold of her house, she seemed to you like a winding-sheet spread out before the door.
She fixed her pleading eyes upon the priest.
Leon was weary of loving without any result; moreover he was beginning to feel that depression caused by the repetition of the same kind of life, when no interest inspires and no hope sustains it. He was so bored with Yonville and its inhabitants, that the sight of certain persons, of certain houses, irritated him beyond endurance; and the chemist, good fellow though he was, was becoming absolutely unbearable to him. Yet the prospect of a new condition of life frightened as much as it seduced him.
This apprehension soon changed into impatience, and then Paris from afar sounded its fanfare of masked balls with the laugh of grisettes.
They looked at one another and their thoughts, confounded in the same agony, clung close together like two throbbing breasts.
She turned around, her chin lowered, her forehead bent forward.
"Because of the change of regimen," continued the chemist, "and of the perturbation that results therefrom in the whole system.
I can't go out for a minute!
I can see, thank you; Justin has the lantern."
Henceforth the memory of Leon was the centre of her boredom; it burnt there more brightly than the fire travellers have left on the snow of a Russian steppe. She sprang towards him, she pressed against him, she stirred carefully the dying embers, sought all around her anything that could revive it; and the most distant reminiscences, like the most immediate occasions, what she experienced as well as what she imagined, her voluptuous desires that were unsatisfied, her projects of happiness that crackled in the wind like dead boughs, her sterile virtue, her lost hopes, the domestic tete-a-tete—she gathered it all up, took everything, and made it all serve as fuel for her melancholy.
She thought herself now far more unhappy; for she had the experience of grief, with the certainty that it would not end.
At the prick of the lancet the blood spurted out, splashing against the looking-glass.
"Some vinegar," he cried.
The ploughman revived, but Justin's syncope still lasted, and his eyeballs disappeared in the pale sclerotics like blue flowers in milk.
Then she went to fetch a bottle of water, and she was melting some pieces of sugar when the chemist arrived.
Then he put three francs on the corner of the table, bowed negligently, and went out.
I'll send them venison, poultry; I'll have myself bled, if need be.
"It seems odd to you, doesn't it, I who am always more cooped up in my laboratory than the man's rat in his cheese."
Homais drew back with stupefaction.
"What a terrible catastrophe!" cried the druggist, who always found expressions in harmony with all imaginable circumstances.
"Ah! yes.
And she protested that she was not mocking him, when the report of a cannon resounded. Immediately all began hustling one another pell-mell towards the village.
Then was seen stepping down from the carriage a gentleman in a short coat with silver braiding, with bald brow, and wearing a tuft of hair at the back of his head, of a sallow complexion and the most benign appearance.
Monsieur Tuvache answered them with compliments; the other confessed himself nervous; and they remained thus, face to face, their foreheads almost touching, with the members of the jury all round, the municipal council, the notable personages, the National Guard and the crowd.
He fetched three stools from the round table under the bust of the monarch, and having carried them to one of the windows, they sat down by each other.
There was commotion on the platform, long whisperings, much parleying.
"But, gentlemen," continued the councillor, "if, banishing from my memory the remembrance of these sad pictures, I carry my eyes back to the actual situation of our dear country, what do I see there?
"And this is what you have understood," said the councillor. "You, farmers, agricultural labourers! you pacific pioneers of a work that belongs wholly to civilization! you, men of progress and morality, you have understood, I say, that political storms are even more redoubtable than atmospheric disturbances!"
Rodolphe had drawn nearer to Emma, and said to her in a low voice, speaking rapidly—
His arms were folded across his knees, and thus lifting his face towards Emma, close by her, he looked fixedly at her.
You do not repulse me!
They looked at one another.
The meeting was over, the crowd dispersed, and now that the speeches had been read, each one fell back into his place again, and everything into the old grooves; the masters bullied the servants, and these struck the animals, indolent victors, going back to the stalls, a green-crown on their horns.
The feast was long, noisy, ill served; the guests were so crowded that they could hardly move their elbows; and the narrow planks used for forms almost broke down under their weight.
He looked at her again, but so hard that she lowered her head, blushing.
And as she objected that she had no horse, Monsieur Rodolphe offered one.
She refused his offer; he did not insist.
Sometimes through a rift in the clouds, beneath a ray of sunshine, gleamed from afar the roots of Yonville, with the gardens at the water's edge, the yards, the walls and the church steeple.
Just as they were entering the forest the sun shone out.
He said—
She feebly tried to disengage herself.
He supported her thus as they walked along.
She was charming on horseback—upright, with her slender waist, her knee bent on the mane of her horse, her face somewhat flushed by the fresh air in the red of the evening.
People looked at her from the windows.
Rodolphe came to fetch it, and put another there, that she always found fault with as too short.
Emma felt about, opening and closing her eyes, while the drops of dew hanging from her hair formed, as it were, a topaz aureole around her face.
Then she examined the apartment, opened the drawers of the tables, combed her hair with his comb, and looked at herself in his shaving-glass.
Emma, half-fainting with terror, nevertheless walked on, and a man stepped out of the tub like a Jack-in-the-box.
She remained until evening racking her brain with every conceivable lying project, and had constantly before her eyes that imbecile with the game-bag.
She lighted one of the kitchen candles that she had hidden behind the books.
He blew out the light.
He had no longer, as formerly, words so gentle that they made her cry, nor passionate caresses that made her mad, so that their great love, which engrossed her life, seemed to lessen beneath her like the water of a stream absorbed into its channel, and she could see the bed of it.
In fact, the little girl was just then rolling on the lawn in the midst of the grass that was being turned.
"However," continued the chemist, "it doesn't concern me.
Charles pierced the skin; a dry crackling was heard.
"Read it yourself," said Bovary.
She brought him linen for his poultices; she comforted, and encouraged him.
Then having flatly declared that it must be amputated, he went off to the chemist's to rail at the asses who could have reduced a poor man to such a state.
We are practitioners; we cure people, and we should not dream of operating on anyone who is in perfect health.
Then, without any consideration for Hippolyte, who was sweating with agony between his sheets, these gentlemen entered into a conversation, in which the druggist compared the coolness of a surgeon to that of a general; and this comparison was pleasing to Canivet, who launched out on the exigencies of his art. He looked upon, it as a sacred office, although the ordinary practitioners dishonoured it. At last, coming back to the patient, he examined the bandages brought by Homais, the same that had appeared for the club-foot, and asked for someone to hold the limb for him. Lestiboudois was sent for, and Monsieur Canivet having turned up his sleeves, passed into the billiard-room, while the druggist stayed with Artemise and the landlady, both whiter than their aprons, and with ears strained towards the door.
He kept downstairs in the sitting-room by the side of the fireless chimney, his chin on his breast, his hands clasped, his eyes staring.
Charles was walking up and down the room; his boots creaked on the floor.
At the unexpected shock of this phrase falling on her thought like a leaden bullet on a silver plate, Emma, shuddering, raised her head in order to find out what he meant to say; and they looked at the other in silence, almost amazed to see each other, so far sundered were they by their inner thoughts. Charles gazed at her with the dull look of a drunken man, while he listened motionless to the last cries of the sufferer, that followed each other in long-drawn modulations, broken by sharp spasms like the far-off howling of some beast being slaughtered. Emma bit her wan lips, and rolling between her fingers a piece of coral that she had broken, fixed on Charles the burning glance of her eyes like two arrows of fire about to dart forth. Everything in him irritated her now; his face, his dress, what he did not say, his whole person, his existence, in fine. She repented of her past virtue as of a crime, and what still remained of it rumbled away beneath the furious blows of her pride. She revelled in all the evil ironies of triumphant adultery. The memory of her lover came back to her with dazzling attractions; she threw her whole soul into it, borne away towards this image with a fresh enthusiasm; and Charles seemed to her as much removed from her life, as absent forever, as impossible and annihilated, as if he had been about to die and were passing under her eyes.
Charles sank back into his arm-chair overwhelmed, trying to discover what could be wrong with her, fancying some nervous illness, weeping, and vaguely feeling something fatal and incomprehensible whirling round him.
She was thinking how to get out of this when the servant coming in put on the mantelpiece a small roll of blue paper "from Monsieur Derozeray's."
Emma pounced upon and opened it.
"Did you think you'd got a virgin?" he exclaimed laughing.
They went at a walking-pace because of the great flag-stones, and on the ground there were bouquets of flowers, offered you by women dressed in red bodices.
But the tradesman cried out that she was wrong; they knew one another; did he doubt her? What childishness! She insisted, however, on his taking at least the chain, and Lheureux had already put it in his pocket and was going, when she called him back.
He was already on the other side of the river and walking fast across the meadow.
Finally, he read some of her letters; they were full of explanations relating to their journey, short, technical, and urgent, like business notes.
"Come," said he, "let's begin."
Rodolphe got up to, shut the window, and when he had sat down again—
"I shall be far away when you read these sad lines, for I have wished to flee as quickly as possible to shun the temptation of seeing you again.
Then, having emptied some water into a glass, Rodolphe dipped his finger into it, and let a big drop fall on the paper, that made a pale stain on the ink.
She could bear it no longer; she ran into the sitting room as if to take the apricots there, overturned the basket, tore away the leaves, found the letter, opened it, and, as if some fearful fire were behind her, Emma flew to her room terrified.
Emma pushed open the door and went in.
She drew back the bolt, and the dazzling light burst in with a leap.
She was free. She advanced, looking at the paving-stones, saying to herself, "Come! come!"
Then she unfolded her napkin as if to examine the darns, and she really thought of applying herself to this work, counting the threads in the linen.
Emma uttered a cry and fell back rigid to the ground.
The table with all the plates was upset; sauce, meat, knives, the salt, and cruet-stand were strewn over the room; Charles was calling for help; Berthe, scared, was crying; and Felicite, whose hands trembled, was unlacing her mistress, whose whole body shivered convulsively.
But turning away her head, Emma said in a broken voice "No, no! no one!"
"And not only," the druggist went on, "are human beings subject to such anomalies, but animals also.
They thought she was delirious; and she was by midnight.
For forty-three days Charles did not leave her. He gave up all his patients; he no longer went to bed; he was constantly feeling her pulse, putting on sinapisms and cold-water compresses. He sent Justin as far as Neufchatel for ice; the ice melted on the way; he sent him back again. He called Monsieur Canivet into consultation; he sent for Dr. Lariviere, his old master, from Rouen; he was in despair. What alarmed him most was Emma's prostration, for she did not speak, did not listen, did not even seem to suffer, as if her body and soul were both resting together after all their troubles.
Her strength returned to her; she got up for a few hours of an afternoon, and one day, when she felt better, he tried to take her, leaning on his arm, for a walk round the garden.
Charles several times asked himself by what means he should next year be able to pay back so much money.
She began by taking out her comb, shaking her head with a quick movement, and when he for the first time saw all this mass of hair that fell to her knees unrolling in black ringlets, it was to him, poor child! like a sudden entrance into something new and strange, whose splendour terrified him.
"Come, come!" said the cure.
All these great artists burn the candle at both ends; they require a dissolute life, that suits the imagination to some extent.
The idea of the theatre quickly germinated in Bovary's head, for he at once communicated it to his wife, who at first refused, alleging the fatigue, the worry, the expense; but, for a wonder, Charles did not give in, so sure was he that this recreation would be good for her. He saw nothing to prevent it: his mother had sent them three hundred francs which he had no longer expected; the current debts were not very large, and the falling in of Lheureux's bills was still so far off that there was no need to think about them. Besides, imagining that she was refusing from delicacy, he insisted the more; so that by dint of worrying her she at last made up her mind, and the next day at eight o'clock they set out in the "Hirondelle."
For fear of seeming ridiculous, Emma before going in wished to have a little stroll in the harbour, and Bovary prudently kept his tickets in his hand, in the pocket of his trousers, which he pressed against his stomach.
Now the lights of the orchestra were lit, the lustre, let down from the ceiling, throwing by the glimmering of its facets a sudden gaiety over the theatre; then the musicians came in one after the other; and first there was the protracted hubbub of the basses grumbling, violins squeaking, cornets trumpeting, flutes and flageolets fifing. But three knocks were heard on the stage, a rolling of drums began, the brass instruments played some chords, and the curtain rising, discovered a country-scene.
Emma leant forward to see him, clutching the velvet of the box with her nails.
People coming out of the theatre passed along the pavement, humming or shouting at the top of their voices, "O bel ange, ma Lucie!*" Then Leon, playing the dilettante, began to talk music. He had seen Tambourini, Rubini, Persiani, Grisi, and, compared with them, Lagardy, despite his grand outbursts, was nowhere.
Monsieur Leon, while studying law, had gone pretty often to the dancing-rooms, where he was even a great success amongst the grisettes, who thought he had a distinguished air.
"I sometimes fancied that some chance would bring you.
Then, when he had taken a deep breath—
"Will you—" She seemed to reflect; then abruptly, "To-morrow at eleven o'clock in the cathedral."
Leon stepped back to go out.
And he first went round the lower aisles. Then he went out to look at the Place.
Leon with solemn steps walked along by the walls.
"Oh, no!" cried the clerk.
Hivert pulled in his horses and, the servant, climbing up to the window, said mysteriously—
Justin was standing up with bowed head, and the chemist was screaming—
It was thus the druggist called a small room under the leads, full of the utensils and the goods of his trade. He often spent long hours there alone, labelling, decanting, and doing up again; and he looked upon it not as a simple store, but as a veritable sanctuary, whence there afterwards issued, elaborated by his hands, all sorts of pills, boluses, infusions, lotions, and potions, that would bear far and wide his celebrity. No one in the world set foot there, and he respected it so, that he swept it himself. Finally, if the pharmacy, open to all comers, was the spot where he displayed his pride, the Capharnaum was the refuge where, egoistically concentrating himself, Homais delighted in the exercise of his predilections, so that Justin's thoughtlessness seemed to him a monstrous piece of irreverence, and, redder than the currants, he repeated—
"Or poison a patient!" continued the druggist. "Do you want to see me in the prisoner's dock with criminals, in a court of justice?
She could not finish, the druggist was thundering—"Empty it!
The lad stooped, but Homais was the quicker, and, having picked up the volume, contemplated it with staring eyes and open mouth.
"No, do not touch it!"
But as he urged her to try, she resolutely began eating, while Charles opposite her sat motionless in a dejected attitude.
A quarter of an hour after he added, "My poor mother! what will become of her now?"
Emma was thinking that it was scarcely forty-eight hours since they had been together, far from the world, all in a frenzy of joy, and not having eyes enough to gaze upon each other.
She insisted.
She took off her bonnet, and they landed on their island.
Mere Lefrancois, when she saw him, uttered many exclamations.
She went on Thursdays. She got up and dressed silently, in order not to awaken Charles, who would have made remarks about her getting ready too early.
Then on a sudden the town appeared.
Shop-boys in caps were cleaning up the shop-fronts, and women with baskets against their hips, at intervals uttered sonorous cries at the corners of streets. She walked with downcast eyes, close to the walls, and smiling with pleasure under her lowered black veil.
The curtains were in red levantine, that hung from the ceiling and bulged out too much towards the bell-shaped bedside; and nothing in the world was so lovely as her brown head and white skin standing out against this purple colour, when, with a movement of shame, she crossed her bare arms, hiding her face in her hands.
They lunched by the fireside on a little round table, inlaid with rosewood.
He knelt on the ground before her, and with both elbows on her knees looked at her with a smile, his face upturned.
Motionless in front of each other, they kept repeating, "Till Thursday, till Thursday."
She went up the streets; reached the Croix-Rouge, put on her overshoes, that she had hidden in the morning under the seat, and sank into her place among the impatient passengers.
He put the matches ready, the candlestick, a book, arranged her nightgown, turned back the bedclothes.
One day, as they were talking philosophically of earthly disillusions, to experiment on his jealousy, or yielding, perhaps, to an over-strong need to pour out her heart, she told him that formerly, before him, she had loved someone. "Not like you," she went on quickly, protesting by the head of her child that "nothing had passed between them."
And she went to the writing-table, ransacked all the drawers, rummaged the papers, and at last lost her head so completely that Charles earnestly begged her not to take so much trouble about those wretched receipts.
Lheureux burst into lamentations and reminded her of all the kindnesses he had shown her.
"But if you haven't any ready money, you have an estate." And he reminded her of a miserable little hovel situated at Barneville, near Aumale, that brought in almost nothing.
"Frankly," he added, "that's a good price."
Don't you think I know what household affairs are?" And he looked at her fixedly, while in his hand he held two long papers that he slid between his nails.
At last, at eleven o'clock, able to bear it no longer, Charles harnessed his chaise, jumped in, whipped up his horse, and reached the "Croix-Rouge" about two o'clock in the morning.
An idea occurred to him.
He threw himself upon her rather than embraced her, crying—
She wanted him to dress all in black, and grow a pointed beard, to look like the portraits of Louis XIII.
"Oh, my dear!" tenderly murmured Madame Homais, alarmed at the vague perils he was preparing to brave.
The druggist would formerly have taken good care not to use such an expression, but he was cultivating a gay Parisian style, which he thought in the best taste; and, like his neighbour, Madame Bovary, he questioned the clerk curiously about the customs of the capital; he even talked slang to dazzle the bourgeois, saying bender, crummy, dandy, macaroni, the cheese, cut my stick and "I'll hook it," for "I am going."
The idea of seeing again the place where his youth had been spent no doubt excited him, for during the whole journey he never ceased talking, and as soon as he had arrived, he jumped quickly out of the diligence to go in search of Leon.
She undressed brutally, tearing off the thin laces of her corset that nestled around her hips like a gliding snake.
But her pride revolted at this.
Once, however, a wretched-looking man, rubicund and bald, came to her house, saying he had been sent by Monsieur Vincart of Rouen.
And opening one of his ledgers, "See," he said.
She renewed the bills, and thus it was continually.
And he walked up and down, his hands behind his back.
On Mid-Lent she did not return to Yonville, but in the evening went to a masked ball. She wore velvet breeches, red stockings, a club wig, and three-cornered hat cocked on one side. She danced all night to the wild tones of the trombones; people gathered round her, and in the morning she found herself on the steps of the theatre together with five or six masks, debardeuses* and sailors, Leon's comrades, who were talking about having supper.
Then she was frightened, pushed back her chair, and cast down her eyes.
"What do I care?" said he, shutting the door.
"At your office." And she looked at him.
She turned away; the street was empty.
She was so overwhelmed, so sad, that she had to lean against a wall to keep herself from falling.
But when the blind man appeared as usual at the foot of the hill he exclaimed—
He advised him to take good wine, good beer, and good joints.
"Now," said Hivert, "for all this trouble you'll give us your performance."
The blind man sank down on his haunches, with his head thrown back, whilst he rolled his greenish eyes, lolled out his tongue, and rubbed his stomach with both hands as he uttered a kind of hollow yell like a famished dog.
It seemed to her very fine thus to throw it away.
"You are taking a shameless advantage of my distress, sir!
"Madame! what do you mean?"
Mere Rollet went out, raised the fingers of her right hand to that side of the sky that was brightest, and came back slowly, saying—
The nurse, however, was a long while gone. But, as there was no clock in the cot, Emma feared she was perhaps exaggerating the length of time. She began walking round the garden, step by step; she went into the path by the hedge, and returned quickly, hoping that the woman would have come back by another road. At last, weary of waiting, assailed by fears that she thrust from her, no longer conscious whether she had been here a century or a moment, she sat down in a corner, closed her eyes, and stopped her ears. The gate grated; she sprang up. Before she had spoken Mere Rollet said to her—
"No matter!" she said, looking at him sadly. "I have suffered much."
"You know," she went on quickly, "that my husband had placed his whole fortune at a notary's.
And then when I come back to him—to him, rich, happy, free—to implore the help the first stranger would give, a suppliant, and bringing back to him all my tenderness, he repulses me because it would cost him three thousand francs!"
Everything in her head, of memories, ideas, went off at once like a thousand pieces of fireworks.
"Ah! it is beginning," she murmured.
"Bring me the child," she said, raising herself on her elbow.
She soon began vomiting blood.
Her limbs were convulsed, her whole body covered with brown spots, and her pulse slipped beneath the fingers like a stretched thread, like a harp-string nearly breaking.
Felicite was running hither and thither in the room. Homais, motionless, uttered great sighs; and Monsieur Canivet, always retaining his self-command, nevertheless began to feel uneasy.
Bovary raised his hands; Canivet stopped short; and Homais pulled off his skull-cap long before the doctor had come in.
Then she turned away her head with a sigh and fell back upon the pillows.
Suddenly on the pavement was heard a loud noise of clogs and the clattering of a stick; and a voice rose—a raucous voice—that sang—
And Emma began to laugh, an atrocious, frantic, despairing laugh, thinking she saw the hideous face of the poor wretch that stood out against the eternal night like a menace.
Charles burst out into blasphemies: "I hate your God!"
A fine rain was falling: Charles, whose chest was bare, at last began to shiver; he went in and sat down in the kitchen.
Monsieur Bournisien was there, and two large candles were burning at the head of the bed, that had been taken out of the alcove. The druggist, on whom the silence weighed, was not long before he began formulating some regrets about this "unfortunate young woman." and the priest replied that there was nothing to do now but pray for her.
"But," objected the chemist, "since God knows all our needs, what can be the good of prayer?"
They sat opposite one another, with protruding stomachs, puffed-up faces, and frowning looks, after so much disagreement uniting at last in the same human weakness, and they moved no more than the corpse by their side, that seemed to be sleeping.
At last, stiffening himself against emotion, Homais gave two or three great cuts at random that left white patches amongst that beautiful black hair.
He entered Maromme shouting for the people of the inn, burst open the door with a thrust of his shoulder, made for a sack of oats, emptied a bottle of sweet cider into the manger, and again mounted his nag, whose feet struck fire as it dashed along.
When he had recovered consciousness, he fell, weeping, into Bovary's arms: "My girl! Emma! my child! tell me—"
Lestiboudois went about the church with his whalebone stick.
At times he thought he felt nothing more, and he enjoyed this lull in his pain, whilst at the same time he reproached himself for being a wretch.
The women followed in black cloaks with turned-down hoods; each of them carried in her hands a large lighted candle, and Charles felt himself growing weaker at this continual repetition of prayers and torches, beneath this oppressive odour of wax and of cassocks.
He also noticed that Monsieur Binet had not been present, and that Tuvache had "made off" after mass, and that Theodore, the notary's servant wore a blue coat, "as if one could not have got a black coat, since that is the custom, by Jove!" And to share his observations with others he went from group to group.
Charles on getting home undressed, and old Rouault put on his blue blouse.
But when he reached the top of the hill he turned back, as he had turned once before on the road of Saint-Victor when he had parted from her.
Charles, among the other congratulations he sent him, wrote this sentence—
He sat down opposite it.
He mended her toys, made her puppets from cardboard, or sewed up half-torn dolls.
Then, if his eyes fell upon the workbox, a ribbon lying about, or even a pin left in a crack of the table, he began to dream, and looked so sad that she became as sad as he.
Some are seen going about alone, and these are not, perhaps, the least dangerous.
But he was released.
Monsieur Bournisien even paid him two or three visits, then gave him up.
She made the first overtures of reconciliation by offering to have the little girl, who could help her in the house, to live with her.
As his affections vanished, he clung more closely to the love of his child.
One day, however, he sat down before it, turned the key, and pressed the spring.
He never went out, saw no one, refused even to visit his patients.
"Master Andry," pursued Jean Jehan, still clinging to his capital, "hold your tongue, or I'll drop on your head!"
Master Andry raised his eyes, seemed to measure in an instant the height of the pillar, the weight of the scamp, mentally multiplied that weight by the square of the velocity and remained silent.
"Where are you bound for in that fashion, Thibaut, ~Tybalde ad dados~, with your back turned to the university, and trotting towards the town?"
"We must have the mystery instantly," resumed the student; "or else, my advice is that we should hang the bailiff of the courts, by way of a morality and a comedy."
The crowd hurled itself towards them, and they already beheld the frail wooden railing, which separated them from it, giving way and bending before the pressure of the throng.
At that moment, the tapestry of the dressing−room, which we have described above, was raised, and afforded passage to a personage, the mere sight of whom suddenly stopped the crowd, and changed its wrath into curiosity as by enchantment.
The two young girls dropped their eyes.
The man, who asked nothing better than to enter into conversation, looked at them with a smile. "So you have nothing to say to me, damsels?"
The tall, light−haired young man retreated a step; but the two curious maidens had no mind to let slip their prize.
Liénarde lowered her eyes modestly.
Besides, the people listened patiently.
A deep silence settled over the assembly, accompanied by stifled laughter at the preposterous names and all the bourgeois designations which each of these personages transmitted with imperturbable gravity to the usher, who then tossed names and titles pell−mell and mutilated to the crowd below.
Jupiter, whose thunder could be heard rumbling in the dressing−room, supported her claim, and Venus was on the point of carrying it off,−−that is to say, without allegory, of marrying monsieur the dauphin, when a young child clad in white damask, and holding in her hand a daisy (a transparent personification of Mademoiselle Marguerite of Flanders) came to contest it with Venus.
With the exception of Gisquette and Liénarde, who turned round from time to time when Gringoire plucked them by the sleeve; with the exception of the big, patient neighbor, no one listened, no one looked at the poor, deserted morality full face. Gringoire saw only profiles.
A pane broken in the pretty rose window above the door, left free a circle of stone through which it was agreed that the competitors should thrust their heads.
"As wicked as he is ugly," retorted another.
"What a devil of a man!" said Robin Poussepain still all bruised with his fall. "He shows himself; he's a hunchback.
The young girl, stopped at length, breathless, and the people applauded her lovingly.
Nothing remained upon the wall but slender fleurs−de−lis, mingled with rose bushes, painted in 1434 by Mathieu Biterne. It was a meagre supper.
The priest resumed his sombre gravity, made a sign to Quasimodo, and retired in silence.
Quasimodo walked in front of him, scattering the crowd as he passed.
Quasimodo came up to him, tossed him four paces away on the pavement with a backward turn of the hand, and plunged rapidly into the gloom, bearing the young girl folded across one arm like a silken scarf.
That said, he turned his back upon the blind man, and pursued his way.
The lame man ran! The cripple in the bowl ran!
But the three beggars did not loose their hold and tore him from the rest, howling, "He belongs to us!"
Reality made its way to the light around him, struck his eyes, struck his feet, and demolished, bit by bit, all that frightful poetry with which he had, at first, believed himself to be surrounded.
"I must call your attention to the fact," continued the king, "that you will be hung all the same."
"Only," continued Clopin imperturbably, "you will be hung later on, with more ceremony, at the expense of the good city of Paris, on a handsome stone gibbet, and by honest men.
They brought two thick posts, terminated at their lower extremities in spreading timber supports, which made them stand readily upon the ground; to the upper extremity of the two posts they fitted a cross−beam, and the whole constituted a very pretty portable gibbet, which Gringoire had the satisfaction of beholding rise before him, in a twinkling.
Perceiving that no respite, nor reprieve, nor subterfuge was possible, he bravely decided upon his course of action; he wound his right foot round his left leg, raised himself on his left foot, and stretched out his arm: but at the moment when his hand touched the manikin, his body, which was now supported upon one leg only, wavered on the stool which had but three; he made an involuntary effort to support himself by the manikin, lost his balance, and fell heavily to the ground, deafened by the fatal vibration of the thousand bells of the manikin, which, yielding to the impulse imparted by his hand, described first a rotary motion, and then swayed majestically between the two posts.
The thieves made him mount the stool, Clopin came to him, passed the rope about his neck, and, tapping him on the shoulder,−−
"Now," resumed Clopin Trouillefou, "as soon as I clap my hands, you, Andry the Red, will fling the stool to the ground with a blow of your knee; you, François Chante−Prune, will cling to the feet of the rascal; and you, Bellevigne, will fling yourself on his shoulders; and all three at once, do you hear?"
Guillaume Longuejoue would beat me." She retreated into the crowd.
They undid the noose, and made the poet step down from the stool.
The gypsy offered it to Gringoire:
"So you don't want me for your husband?" The young girl looked at him intently, and said, "No."
Each wave of time contributes its alluvium, each race deposits its layer on the monument, each individual brings his stone.
Art often undergoes a transformation while they are pending, ~pendent opera interrupta~; they proceed quietly in accordance with the transformed art.
Beyond, the fields gleamed green; beyond, fled the roads, along which were scattered a few more suburban houses, which became more infrequent as they became more distant.
I do not see why history has not transmitted to posterity the names of these four discreet and venerable damsels.
"To think that Monsieur of Reims sent this enormity to Monsieur of Paris," added la Gaultière, clasping her hands.
"A fine, flaming fagot," added the old woman.
Only, he imagined, for he was at the age when illusions are as yet replaced only by illusions, that the affections of blood and family were the sole ones necessary, and that a little brother to love sufficed to fill an entire existence.
And all this came from Quasimodo.
What that cell contained, no one knew; but from the strand of the Terrain, at night, there was often seen to appear, disappear, and reappear at brief and regular intervals, at a little dormer window opening upon the back of the tower, a certain red, intermittent, singular light which seemed to follow the panting breaths of a bellows, and to proceed from a flame, rather than from a light.
He seemed to meditate for a moment, and then resumed: "Gossip Tourangeau, since that is your name, turn your head, you will find my reply already written on the wall."
Between theocratic architecture and this there is the difference that lies between a sacred language and a vulgar language, between hieroglyphics and art, between Solomon and Phidias.
Take away the press; heresy is enervated.
All the life which is leaving architecture comes to it.
In the nineteenth, it begins to reconstruct.
Good! Another amorous woman!
Quasimodo turned round, shrugging his hump with disdain, while Master Florian, equally astonished, and supposing that the laughter of the spectators had been provoked by some irreverent reply from the accused, rendered visible to him by that shrug of the shoulders, apostrophized him indignantly,−−"You have uttered a reply, knave, which deserves the halter.
And he seated himself, utterly breathless, wiping away the great drops of sweat which fell from his brow and drenched, like tears, the parchments spread out before him.
Eh, be quick, Mahiette! redouble your pace and drag along your boy.
Oudarde and Gervaise rejoined her.
The old father died when Paquette was still a mere child; she had then no one but her mother, the sister of M. Pradon, master−brazier and coppersmith in Paris, Rue Farm− Garlin, who died last year.
The mother was a good simple woman, unfortunately, and she taught Paquette nothing but a bit of embroidery and toy−making which did not prevent the little one from growing very large and remaining very poor.
She put them into the tiny shoes, took them out, admired them, marvelled at them, looked at the light through them, was curious to see them try to walk on her bed, and would gladly have passed her life on her knees, putting on and taking off the shoes from those feet, as though they had been those of an Infant Jesus."
The three women retraced their steps, and, on arriving in the vicinity of the Tour−Roland, Oudarde said to the other two,−−
Again she shook her head, looked at Oudarde fixedly and replied, "Water." Oudarde persisted,−−"No, sister, that is no beverage for January.
And the crowd burst into a laugh, especially the boys and young girls.
Quasimodo leaped as though awakened with a start.
He merely turned his head backward, to the right, then to the left, balancing it as a bull does who has been stung in the flanks by a gadfly.
Soon the blood burst forth, and could be seen trickling in a thousand threads down the hunchback's black shoulders; and the slender thongs, in their rotatory motion which rent the air, sprinkled drops of it upon the crowd.
"This is the grimace of the pillory. When shall we have that of the gibbet?"
And all began to laugh.
The young girl looked at him again, then she blushed as though a flame had mounted into her cheeks, and, taking her tambourine under her arm, she made her way through the astonished spectators towards the door of the house where Phoebus was calling her, with slow, tottering steps, and with the troubled look of a bird which is yielding to the fascination of a serpent.
The name of some festival when the bells are pealed! So he took the liberty of carrying you off, as though you were made for beadles!
The captain burst out laughing. "Corne−de−boeuf! here's pity as well placed as a feather in a pig's tail!
"That petticoat is so short that it makes one tremble," added la Gaillefontaine.
"True God!" exclaimed the captain, "that's not the way to depart.
Come back and dance something for us.
The crowd was swarming around her; from time to time, a man accoutred in red and yellow made them form into a circle, and then returned, seated himself on a chair a few paces from the dancer, and took the goat's head on his knees.
When they had advanced a few paces, Dom Claude placed his back against a pillar, and gazed intently at Gringoire.
This garment presented itself, I took it, and I left my ancient black smock, which, for a hermetic like myself, was far from being hermetically closed.
"What concern is it of yours?"
One would have said that there was no longer a musician in the belfry.
This sight suddenly changed the course of his ideas, and congealed his enthusiasm as a breath of air congeals melted rosin.
He dressed himself sadly.
Then he hastily donned his long jacket with furred half− sleeves, picked up his cap, and went out like a man driven to desperation.
He stopped a beadle who emerged from the cloister,−−"Where is monsieur the archdeacon of Josas?"
Jehan clapped his hands.
The key was in the lock, the door was very close to him; he gave it a gentle push and thrust his head through the opening.
But what is one to do in order to extract from science the secret of this general law?
"Others have thought," continued the dreamy archdeacon, "that it would be better worth while to operate upon a ray of Sirius.
"Hence," continued the priest, "one wretched thought is sufficient to render a man weak and beside himself!
Suddenly, Dom Claude sprang up, seized a compass and engraved in silence upon the wall in capital letters, this Greek word
"Who," pursued the archdeacon, "is that Mahiet Fargel, whose gown you have torn? ~Tunicam dechiraverunt~, saith the complaint."
"Yes," pursued the priest shaking his head, "that is the state of learning and letters at the present day.
"Young man," resumed the archdeacon, "at the king's last entry, there was a young gentleman, named Philippe de Comines, who wore embroidered on the housings of his horse this device, upon which I counsel you to meditate: ~Qui non laborat, non manducet~."
She flies, she is joyous, she is just born; she seeks the spring, the open air, liberty: oh, yes! but let her come in contact with the fatal network, and the spider issues from it, the hideous spider!
But release my arm, master, for pity's sake!
"Oh, madman!" he went on, without removing his gaze from the window. "And even couldst thou have broken through that formidable web, with thy gnat's wings, thou believest that thou couldst have reached the light?
"~Te Deum Laudamus~!" exclaimed Master Jehan, creeping out from his hole, "the screech−owls have departed.
He cast a glance of tenderness and admiration into the interior of the precious pouch, readjusted his toilet, rubbed up his boots, dusted his poor half sleeves, all gray with ashes, whistled an air, indulged in a sportive pirouette, looked about to see whether there were not something more in the cell to take, gathered up here and there on the furnace some amulet in glass which might serve to bestow, in the guise of a trinket, on Isabeau la Thierrye, finally pushed open the door which his brother had left unfastened, as a last indulgence, and which he, in his turn, left open as a last piece of malice, and descended the circular staircase, skipping like a bird.
He advanced a few paces, and caught sight of the two screech owls, that is to say, Dom Claude and Master Jacques Charmolue, absorbed in contemplation before a carving on the façade.
By listening to them attentively, the man in the mantle could catch in its entirety the following interesting conversation,−−
"Captain," pursued the man, "to−morrow, the day after to−morrow, a month hence, ten years hence, you will find me ready to cut your throat; but go first to your rendezvous."
While her back was turned, the bushy−headed and ragged little boy who was playing in the ashes, adroitly approached the drawer, abstracted the crown, and put in its place a dry leaf which he had plucked from a fagot.
The young girl looked at him in affright: "Hate me! what have I done?"
"Phoebus," continued the Bohemian, gently releasing her waist from the captain's tenacious hands, "You are good, you are generous, you are handsome; you saved me, me who am only a poor child lost in Bohemia.
"Do I love thee, angel of my life!" exclaimed the captain, half kneeling. "My body, my blood, my soul, all are thine; all are for thee.
"Die!" exclaimed the amorous captain, "What are you saying, my lovely angel?
The captain's face assumed an expression of mingled surprise and disdain, of carelessness and libertine passion.
"My beautiful love," resumed Phoebus, tenderly, "what nonsense is this?
When she recovered her senses, she was surrounded by soldiers of the watch they were carrying away the captain, bathed in his blood the priest had disappeared; the window at the back of the room which opened on the river was wide open; they picked up a cloak which they supposed to belong to the officer and she heard them saying around her,
The scholar went his way, and Gringoire set out to follow the crowd which was mounting the staircase of the great chamber.
The populace which he had joined walked and elbowed in silence.
"Monsieur," Gringoire inquired of one of his neighbors, "who are all those persons ranged yonder, like prelates in council?"
The girl does not concern me, but the goat!
The elegant beast halted for a moment on the threshold, stretching out its neck as though, perched on the summit of a rock, it had before its eyes an immense horizon.
Sometimes, they went even further than animals.
"For the last time, do you confess the facts in the case?" demanded Charmolue, with his imperturbable benignity.
A few apathetic faces of judges alone could be dimly discerned.
When Charmolue had installed himself in a magisterial manner in his own, he seated himself, then rose and said, without exhibiting too much self−complacency at his success,−−"The accused has confessed all."
This incident, this last proof, produced a great effect.
The priest threw back his cowl; she looked.
Here the priest paused, and the prisoner heard sighs of anguish break from his breast with a sound of the death rattle.
"Accordingly, I denounced you.
The prisoner recoiled with horror.
He was not listening to her.
All at once, the young girl beheld his head reappear; it wore a frightful expression, and he cried, hoarse with rage and despair,−−
"Some children said that it was a gypsy," went on the recluse.
"Do I hate them!" exclaimed the recluse, " they are vampires, stealers of children!
Thanks, priest!" she cried.
They untied her hands, made her alight, accompanied by her goat, which had also been unbound, and which bleated with joy at finding itself free: and they made her walk barefoot on the hard pavement to the foot of the steps leading to the door.
The rope about her neck trailed behind her.
She looked intently at him: "Begone, demon, or I will denounce you!"
He staggered, passed his hand across his eyes, looked again, muttered a curse, and all his features were violently contorted.
She raised her dry, red eyes to heaven, to the sun, to the silvery clouds, cut here and there by a blue trapezium or triangle; then she lowered them to objects around her, to the earth, the throng, the houses; all at once, while the yellow man was binding her elbows, she uttered a terrible cry, a cry of joy.
She raised her eyelids, looked at Quasimodo, then closed them again suddenly, as though terrified by her deliverer.
Then the women laughed and wept, the crowd stamped with enthusiasm, for, at that moment Quasimodo had a beauty of his own.
Then he laughed frightfully, and suddenly became pale again, when he considered the most sinister side of his fatal passion, of that corrosive, venomous malignant, implacable love, which had ended only in the gibbet for one of them and in hell for the other; condemnation for her, damnation for him.
When he heard the brisk challenge of the men−at−arms of the abbey, around the crenelated, circumscribing wall of Saint−Germain, he turned aside, took a path which presented itself between the abbey and the lazar−house of the bourg, and at the expiration of a few minutes found himself on the verge of the Pré−aux−Clercs.
When the boatman had taken his departure, he remained standing stupidly on the strand, staring straight before him and perceiving objects only through magnifying oscillations which rendered everything a sort of phantasmagoria to him.
The chimneys of the houses, the battlements of the walls, the faceted gables of the roofs, the spire of the Augustines, the tower of Nesle, all these projections which broke the profile of the colossal obelisk added to the illusion by displaying in eccentric fashion to the eye the indentations of a luxuriant and fantastic sculpture.
His knees gave way beneath him, and he sank upon the pavement, thinking of her who had died that day.
As long as that course lasted, the young girl had been unable to recover her senses, half unconscious, half awake, no longer feeling anything, except that she was mounting through the air, floating in it, flying in it, that something was raising her above the earth.
She made haste to dress herself.
Do not look at me; only listen to me.
"Do come," she cried, but he continued to retreat.
Then she darted from her cell, ran to him, and grasped his arm.
He watched her attentively while she was speaking.
I will love you for it!"
When he reached the Place, he no longer saw anything except the handsome horse hitched at the door of the Gondelaurier house; the captain had just entered there.
The captain halted.
"Come, captain, 'tis a woman who is waiting for you." He added with an effort: "A woman who loves you."
"Oh!" said the poor deaf man, in a very low voice; "to refuse that!" He re−entered Notre−Dame, lighted his lamp and climbed to the tower again.
Quasimodo looked him full in the face, a trembling seized him, and he released the priest and shrank back.
Then she added with a pitiless expression, well aware that she was about to pierce the priest's heart with thousands of red−hot irons,−− "Ah!
When he was gone, Quasimodo picked up the whistle which had just saved the gypsy. "It was getting rusty," he said, as he handed it back to her; then he left her alone.
"So you have no care, Master Pierre?" resumed the archdeacon, gazing intently at Gringoire.
After a silence, the priest resumed,−− "You are, nevertheless, tolerably poor?"
"That concerns us not."
"What is that to me?"
"Malediction!" exclaimed Dom Claude. "You are the executioner.
"Brother," resumed the hypocrite, "you are so good to me, and you give me such wise counsels that I always return to you."
There was a moment of partial silence, during which the sharp voice of the Duke of Egypt rose, as he gave instructions to his Bohemians.
I quote the text.
That is why we call upon you to return the girl if you wish to save your church, or we will take possession of the girl again and pillage the church, which will be a good thing.
Thus, as soon as they began to batter the grand door, the shower of rough blocks of stone began to fall, and it seemed to them that the church itself was being demolished over their heads.
"Let us make another trial," resumed the vagabond.
"What is that to me?" said Clopin.
The arrow broken, Quasimodo breathing heavily, bounded like a grasshopper, and he fell upon the scholar, whose armor was flattened against the wall by the blow.
He paused breathless, then resumed energetically,−−
They serve no purpose, as they stand thus useless round the king; they produce upon me the effect of the four Evangelists who surround the face of the big clock of the palace, and which Philippe Brille has just set in order afresh.
"~Pasque−Dieu~!" exclaimed the king.
"So," resumed the king,−−"speak sir,−−there is a commotion among the louts in our good city of Paris?"
When Gringoire paused at last, quite out of breath, he raised his head tremblingly towards the king, who was engaged in scratching a spot on the knee of his breeches with his finger− nail; then his majesty began to drink from the goblet of ptisan.
At last the king looked at him. "Here is a terrible bawler!" said, he.
"~Pulsus creber, anhelans, crepitans, irregularis~," continued the leech.
"Since your majesty is so clement," replied the leech, "you will not refuse to aid me a little in building my house, Rue Saint−André−des−Arcs."
"I am at the end of my finances," pursued the doctor; and it would really be a pity that the house should not have a roof; not on account of the house, which is simple and thoroughly bourgeois, but because of the paintings of Jehan Fourbault, which adorn its wainscoating.
Yes, gentlemen," added the king turning to the Flemings, "this man hath been an ambassador.
I! 'tis different," returned the king. "If I willed."
I mount it, and I say aloud, in the first words that occur to me, what I have on my heart; and when one is of the people, sire, one always has something on the heart: Then people troop up, they shout, they ring the alarm bell, they arm the louts with what they take from the soldiers, the market people join in, and they set out.
Louis XI. returned and seated himself, saying, with a smile,−− "Ah! here they have only got as far as the bailiffs." At that instant Olivier le Daim returned.
Here, as though seized with a sudden idea, he flung himself on his knees before his chair, took off his hat, placed it on the seat, and gazing devoutly at one of the leaden amulets which loaded it down,
He made the sign of the cross, rose, donned his hat once more, and said to Tristan,−−
I come from him.
France! cut down the louts!
The frightened vagabonds wheeled round.
She raised her eyes once more, and recognized the poet in very fact.
He took a position in the stern; and the young girl, whom the stranger inspired with an indefinable uneasiness, seated herself close to the poet.
But the man in black finally recovered himself, seized the oars once more and began to row against the current.
The man halted, turned towards her and raised his cowl.
Then listen to me.
Oh!−−There is a decree of Parliament which gives you back to the scaffold.
He reddened, turned pale, then released her and gazed at her with a gloomy air.
The lean and bony fingers which bruised her, clenched on her flesh and met around it.
When your mother, the gypsy, comes to reclaim you, I shall say to her: 'Mother, look at that gibbet!−−Or, give me back my child.
When her daughter was inside the cell, she laid her gently on the ground, then raised her up again, and bearing her in her arms as though she were still only her little Agnes, she walked to and fro in her little room,intoxicated, frantic, joyous, crying out, singing, kissing her daughter, talking to her, bursting into laughter, melting into tears, all at once and with vehemence.
"Do you see, my little girl," resumed the recluse, interspersing her words with kisses, "I shall love you dearly?
The priest says that we shall find her at the Rat−Hole." The noise of the horses began again.
She made her crouch down, arranged her carefully so that neither foot nor hand projected from the shadow, untied her black hair which she spread over her white robe to conceal it, placed in front of her her jug and her paving stone, the only articles of furniture which she possessed, imagining that this jug and stone would hide her.
The commander dismounted, and came toward her.
"Come, now, old madwoman," began the commander again, "do not lie.
"Through the Rue du Mouton, I believe." Tristan turned his head and made a sign to his troop to prepare to set out on the march again.
Rennet returned once more to the provost in great embarrassment.
She threw herself upon it, she tried to hold it back; she scratched the stone with her nails, but the massive block, set in movement by six men, escaped her and glided gently to the ground along the iron levers.
"Come, now," repeated the provost. "Here you, Rennet Cousin!"
Then she shook herself and shrieked in a loud and heartrending voice: "No! no!
The headsman howled with pain.
They thrust her back with much brutality, and noticed that her head fell heavily on the pavement. They raised her, she fell back again.
As he approached it, he fancied that he might, perhaps, find her there.
He uttered not a word; only at long intervals, a sob heaved his body violently, but it was a tearless sob, like summer lightning which makes no noise.
This figure was coming towards him.
In this terrible situation, the archdeacon said not a word, uttered not a groan.
Once, he glanced below him into the Place, into the abyss; the head which he raised again had its eyes closed and its hair standing erect.
His cassock burst open at the same time.
Then, feeling everything give way beneath him, with nothing but his stiffened and failing hands to support him, the unfortunate man closed his eyes and let go of the spout.
To that deep charnel−house, where so many human remains and so many crimes have rotted in company, many great ones of this world, many innocent people, have contributed their bones, from Enguerrand de Marigni, the first victim, and a just man, to Admiral de Coligni, who was its last, and who was also a just man.
"It's better for you if you give us the things than if you leave them in the storeroom," they said. "Things have a tendency to go missing in the storeroom, and after a certain amount of time they sell things off, whether the case involved has come to an end or not.
K. paid hardly any attention to what they were saying, he did not place much value on what he may have still possessed or on who decided what happened to them. It was much more important to him to get a clear understanding of his position, but he could not think clearly while these people were here, the second policeman's belly - and they could only be policemen - looked friendly enough, sticking out towards him, but when K. looked up and saw his dry, boney face it did not seem to fit with the body.
K. stared at the supervisor.
No-one stopped him doing this and he pushed his sleeves back, felt his chest, straightened his hair, went over to the three men, said, "It makes no sense," at which these three turned round to face him and came towards him with serious expressions. He finally came again to a halt in front of the supervisor's desk.
You want to see some point in it while you're carrying out something as pointless as it could be?
The supervisor may have agreed with him, at least K. thought that was what he saw from the corner of his eye.
You're simply under arrest, nothing more than that.
Thank you for your suggestions, but I won't accept them.
She pulled her hand away and answered, "No, no, I'm never cross with anyone."
He very soon went to sleep, but before he did he thought a little while about his behaviour, he was satisfied with it but felt some surprise that he was not more satisfied; he was seriously worried about Miss Bürstner because of the captain.
"No, no, " said K., he stepped to one side but did not go away entirely.
He dressed hurriedly, without the time to think and assemble the various plans he had worked out during the week. With no breakfast, he rushed to the suburb he had been told about.
All of them seemed to be looking at him, surprised at seeing their superior running; it was a kind of pride that made K. want to go on foot, this was his affair and the idea of any help from strangers, however slight, was repulsive to him, he also wanted to avoid asking for anyone's help because that would initiate them into the affair even if only slightly. And after all, he had no wish at all to humiliate himself before the committee by being too punctual.
It turned out, though, that that was mostly possible without further ado, as almost all the doors were left open and the children ran in and out.
Half grown girls, who seemed to be dressed in just their pinafores worked hardest running to and fro.
It was usually a woman who opened the door, heard the enquiry and turned to somebody in the room who would raise himself from the bed.
It's on behalf of them that I stand here now, not for myself alone."
On the contrary, they stood in his way, old men held out their arms in front of him and a hand from somewhere - he did not have the time to turn round - took hold of his collar.
K. laughed towards the door.
"It's not so much the room that surprises me," said K., looking at her crossly, "it's your being married that shocks me."
So that's what all this is about, thought K., she's offering herself to me, she's as degenerate as everything else around here, she's had enough of the court officials, which is understandable I suppose, and so she approaches any stranger and makes compliments about his eyes.
K. looked at him with some curiosity, he was the first student he had ever met of the unfamiliar discipline of jurisprudence, face to face at least, a man who would even most likely attain high office one day.
K. saw this as confirmation of the tyranny the student held over the woman and which she had already complained about, he stood up and walked up and down the room.
K. followed them slowly. He realised that this was the first unambiguous setback he had suffered from these people.
All he did, he just chases after any woman.
Then the usher of the court stepped forward to him and, in order to calm him down and raise his spirits, said, "The gentleman here's only asking what it is you're waiting for.
The usher remained always one or two steps behind K, which he found irritating as in a place like this it could give the impression that he was being driven along by someone who had arrested him, so he frequently waited for the usher to catch up, but the usher always remained behind him.
K. looked at the usher.
So he said, "I am able to walk now," and stood up, shaking after becoming used to sitting so comfortably.
K. said nothing, did not even look up, he tolerated the two of them negotiating over him like an object, that was even what suited him best.
K. nodded, but started to move off again when the information-giver repeated, "Would you not like to sit down here a while?"
He was at their mercy, if they let go of him he would fall like a board.
Their little eyes glanced here and there, K. could feel the evenness of their steps but could not do the same, as from step to step he was virtually being carried.
K. then stood still for a while, combed his hair with the help of a pocket mirror, picked up his hat from the next stair - the information-giver must have thrown it down there - and then he ran down the steps so fresh and in such long leaps that the contrast with his previous state nearly frightened him.
Then he wrote her a letter, both to the office and the flat, attempting once more to justify his behaviour, offered to make whatever amends he could, promised never to cross whatever boundary she might set him and begged merely to have the chance to speak to her some time, especially as he was unable to do anything with Mrs. Grubach either until he had spoken with Miss Bürstner, he finally informed her that the following Sunday he would stay in his room all day waiting for a sign from her that there was some hope of his request being fulfilled, or at least that she would explain to him why she could not fulfil it even though he had promised to observe whatever stipulations she might make.
In silence, the two of them drew chairs out from the farthest end of the table and sat down facing each other.
But Miss Montag stood straight up again as she had left her handbag on the window sill and went to fetch it; she shuffled down the whole length of the room.
In that way she took control of what he wanted to say before he said it.
For a while there was silence, but then came some more sighs. His first thought was to fetch one of the servitors, it might well have been worth having a witness present, but then he was taken by an uncontrollable curiosity that make him simply yank the door open.
"How's that?" asked K., looking at him.
"They've opened the door for you, now," said the gentleman, pointing at the door of the lawyer.
K. himself looked on calmly, he was not even disappointed at finding the lawyer unwell, he had been able to do nothing to oppose the enthusiasm his uncle had developed for the matter, he was glad that this enthusiasm had now been distracted without his having to do anything about it.
"Whose business is it then?" asked the lawyer in an exhausted voice as he leant back again.
The lawyer now looked so much stronger that it seemed the idea of being visited because he was ill had somehow made him weak, he remained supporting himself of one elbow, which must have been rather tiring, and continually pulled at a lock of hair in the middle of his beard.
K. believed he understood not a word of this entire speech, he looked at his uncle for an explanation but his uncle sat on the bedside table with the candle in his hand, a medicine bottle had rolled off the table onto the floor, he nodded to everything the lawyer said, agreed to everything, and now and then looked at K. urging him to show the same compliance.
"What circles should I move in, then, if not with members of my own discipline?" the lawyer added.
"You have to realise," the lawyer continued, in a tone as if he were explaining something obvious, unnecessary and incidental, "you have to realise that I also derive great advantage for my clients from mixing with those people, and do so in many different ways, it's not something you can keep talking about all the time.
Now he stood up with a great deal of fuss, clearly unhappy that attention had been drawn to him.
K. was able to quietly watch everything as nobody paid any attention to him, the office director took over as leader of the conversation as seemed to be his habit once he had been called forward, the lawyer listened attentively with his hand to his ear, his initial weakness having perhaps only had the function of driving away his new visitors, K.'s uncle served as candle-bearer - balancing the candle on his thigh while the office director frequently glanced nervously at it - and was soon free of his embarrassment and was quickly enchanted not only by the office director's speaking manner but also by the gentle, waving hand-movements with which he accompanied it.
But do you have to be always thinking about your trial?" she added slowly.
Then she hung both her arms around his neck, leant back and took a long look at him.
He was almost aghast as he looked up at her, now that she was so close to him there was a bitter, irritating smell from her, like pepper, she grasped his head, leant out over him, and bit and kissed his neck, even biting into his hair.
Just then, her knee slipped out and, with a little cry, she nearly fell down onto the carpet, K. tried to hold her by putting his arms around her and was pulled down with her.
The lawyer, in contrast, did not ask questions but did all the talking himself or sat silently facing him, leant forward slightly over the desk, probably because he was hard of hearing, pulled on a strand of hair in the middle of his beard and looked down at the carpet, perhaps at the very spot where K. had lain with Leni.
Once the lawyer thought he had humiliated K. sufficiently, he usually started something that would raise his spirits again.
But K. should not forget that the trial would not be public, if the court deems it necessary it can be made public but there is no law that says it has to be.
The first signs of it could already be seen in the fact that the first documents still had not been submitted even though the trial had already lasted several months, and that, according to the lawyer, everything was still in its initial stages, which was very effective, of course, in making the defendant passive and keeping him helpless. Then he could be suddenly surprised with the verdict, or at least with a notification that the hearing had not decided in his favour and the matter would be passed on to a higher office.
But the deputy director did not notice this at all, or if he did notice it it only raised his spirits, he frequently laughed out loud, one time he clearly embarrassed the manufacturer when he raised an objection in a witty way but drew him immediately back out of his embarrassment by commenting adversely on himself, and finally invited him into his office where they could bring the matter to its conclusion.
"It's a very important matter," said the manufacturer. "I understand that completely.
He's been coming to me in my office for years from time to time, and brings little pictures with him which I buy more or less just for the sake of charity as he's hardly more than a beggar.
But was K. not giving up more than he absolutely had to?
K. followed them slowly, caught up with one of the girls who had stumbled and been left behind by the others, and asked her as they went up side by side, "Is there a painter, Titorelli, who lives here?"
The only one to succeed was the hunchback when she slipped through under his outstretched arm, but the painter chased after her, grabbed her by the skirt, span her once round and set her down again by the door with the other girls who, unlike the first, had not dared to cross the doorstep while the painter had left his post.
K. found the painter's work more engrossing than he had wanted; but finally he reproached himself for staying so long without having done anything relevant to his own affair.
The painter even seemed to misunderstand why K. remained at the edge of the bed and urged K. to make himself comfortable, and as he hesitated he went over to the bed himself and pressed K. deep down into the bedclothes and pillows.
To make the most of his pleasure he added, "I am totally innocent."
Except, that one of them had pushed a drinking straw through a crack between the planks and was moving it slowly up and down.
"How's that?" asked the painter patiently, leaning back with a smile.
All the time the painter was speaking, K. was considering whether he should take off his coat, but he finally realised that, if he didn't do so, he would be quite unable to stay here any longer, so he took off his frock coat and lay it on his knee so that he could put it back on again as soon as the conversation was over.
So when it happens it has hardly any effect.
The trial doesn't stop, but the defendant is almost as certain of avoiding conviction as if he'd been acquitted.
From under the bed, the painter withdrew a pile of unframed paintings. They were so covered in dust that when the painter tried to blow it off the one on top the dust swirled around in front of K.'s eyes, robbing him of breath for some time.
A lot of people don't like that sort of picture because they're too gloomy, but there are others, and you're one of them, who love gloomy themes."
Someone unlocked the door, but kept himself pressed against it as he called back inside, "It's him!", and only then did he open the door properly.
K., though, pushed her away and said, "I don't want you to kiss me now."
She helped him off with his coat, took the hat off his head, ran with the things into the hallway to hang them up, then she ran back and saw to the soup.
"Tell him I'm here first," said K.
Now he considered his affair too important to let this little businessman take part in it and perhaps change some of his decisions, and so he called Leni back even though she was already on her way to the lawyer.
Yes, well over five years," he then added, pulling out an old briefcase, "I've got everything written down; I can tell you the exact dates if you like.
"On my lips?" asked K., pulling out a pocket mirror and examining himself. "I can see nothing special about my lips.
"My case," the businessman continued, "didn't move on at all, there were some hearings that took place and I went to every one of them, collected materials, handed all my business books to the court - which I later found was entirely unnecessary - I ran back and forth to the lawyer, and he submitted various documents to the court too ..."
"What's wrong with you today?" asked Leni, tapped him gently and carried on with what she had been doing.
"Yes, that's right," said the businessman, but did not continue with what he'd been saying.
K. looked long at him; his first impression of the businessman had perhaps not been right; he had experience as his trial had already lasted a long time, but he had paid a heavy price for this experience.
"Bring him to bed, then!" he called out to Leni, who seemed to understand him.
"I find that quite acceptable," said K. The lawyer looked at him quizzically.
"Then allow me to say a few words," said the lawyer, throwing the bed cover to one side and sitting on the edge of the bed.
I admit that quite openly.
"After a certain point in the proceedings," said the lawyer quietly and calmly, "nothing new of any importance ever happens.
It could almost be supposed he was deliberately hiding his thoughts as he waited to see what effect his words would have.
"And let there be no-one besides me," said the lawyer. Block fully understood what that meant, he glowered at K., shaking his head violently.
A difference of opinion, nothing more.
K. began to anticipate many difficulties, he gave up trying to understand what the Italian said - with the director there, who could understand him so easily, it would have been pointless effort - and for the time being did no more than scowl at the Italian as he relaxed sitting deep but comfortable in the armchair, as he frequently pulled at his short, sharply tailored jacket and at one time lifted his arms in the air and moved his hands freely to try and depict something that K. could not grasp, even though he was leaning forward and did not let the hands out of his sight. K. had nothing to occupy himself but mechanically watch the exchange between the two men and his tiredness finally made itself felt, to his alarm, although fortunately in good time, he once caught himself nearly getting up, turning round and leaving.
The cathedral also seemed quite empty, of course no-one would think of going there on a day like this.
K. went back to the main entrance, stood there indecisively for a while, and then walked round the cathedral in the rain in case the Italian was waiting at another entrance.
He put his torch away and went back to his place.
But under the pulpit - K. grinned in astonishment - there really was a priest standing with his hand on the handrail ready to climb the steps and looking at K. Then he nodded very slightly, so that K. crossed himself and genuflected as he should have done earlier.
At the front pews he stopped, but to the priest he still seemed too far away, he reached out his hand and pointed sharply down with his finger to a place immediately in front of the pulpit.
He accepts everything, but as he does so he says, 'I'll only accept this so that you don't think there's anything you've failed to do'.
'Everyone wants access to the law,' says the man, 'how come, over all these years, no-one but me has asked to be let in?' The doorkeeper can see the man's come to his end, his hearing has faded, and so, so that he can be heard, he shouts to him: 'Nobody else could have got in this way, as this entrance was meant only for you.
He stays at his post for many years and doesn't close the gate until the very end, he's very conscious of the importance of his service, as he says, 'I'm powerful,' he has respect for his superiors, as he says, 'I'm only the lowliest of the doormen', he's not talkative, as through all these years the only questions he asks are 'disinterested', he's not corruptible, as when he's offered a gift he says, 'I'll only accept this so that you don't think there's anything you've failed to do,' as far as fulfilling his duty goes he can be neither ruffled nor begged, as it says about the man that, 'he tires the doorkeeper with his requests', even his external appearance suggests a pedantic character, the big hooked nose and the long, thin, black tartar-beard. How could any doorkeeper be more faithful to his duty?
There are various opinions about this, some say the doorkeeper was only answering a question or showing his devotion to duty or, just when the man was in his last moments, the doorkeeper wanted to cause him regret and sorrow.
He thought of the flies that tear their legs off struggling to get free of the flypaper. "These gentleman will have some hard work to do".
Here they released their hold on K., who just waited in silence, and took their top hats off while they looked round the quarry and wiped the sweat off their brows with their handkerchiefs.
It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.
He could see from the bed that it had been set for four o'clock as it should have been; it certainly must have rung.
So please open up this door.
And the two girls, their skirts swishing, immediately ran out through the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat as they went. How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly?
Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair. Once there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding himself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs.
The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convinced and finally won over; the future of Gregor and his family depended on it!
"Mother, mother", said Gregor gently, looking up at her.
Gregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his decisions, as early the next morning, almost before the night had ended, his sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the front room and looked anxiously in.
However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately and looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with some surprise. She immediately picked it up - using a rag, not her bare hands - and carried it out.
There were old, half-rotten vegetables; bones from the evening meal, covered in white sauce that had gone hard; a few raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had declared inedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread with butter and salt.
He was immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and he hurried back under the couch.
They had even got used to it, both Gregor and the family, they took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it, although there was no longer much warm affection given in return.
One day, about a month after Gregor's transformation when his sister no longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance, she came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still staring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be most horrible.
He sat unyielding on his picture.
An apple thrown without much force glanced against Gregor's back and slid off without doing any harm.
Sometimes his father would wake up and say to Gregor's mother "you're doing so much sewing again today!", as if he did not know that he had been dozing - and then he would go back to sleep again while mother and sister would exchange a tired grin.
This is what peace I get in my old age!" And supported by the two women he would lift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load himself, let the women take him to the door, send them off and carry on by himself while Gregor's mother would throw down her needle and his sister her pen so that they could run after his father and continue being of help to him.
The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited.
"Father, Mother", said his sister, hitting the table with her hand as introduction, "we can't carry on like this.
In her alarm, which was totally beyond Gregor's comprehension, his sister even abandoned his mother as she pushed herself vigorously out of her chair as if more willing to sacrifice her own mother than stay anywhere near Gregor. She rushed over to behind her father, who had become excited merely because she was and stood up half raising his hands in front of Gregor's sister as if to protect her.
As soon as he had finally finished turning round he began to move straight ahead.
The three of them at first just nodded without looking up from what they were writing, and it was only when the cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up in irritation.
So, as she was prevented from telling them all about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in and, clearly peeved, called out "Cheerio then, everyone", turned round sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.
And the usual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner enters a country, all the subject states are drawn to him, moved by the hatred which they feel against the ruling power.
Therefore Louis made these five errors: he destroyed the minor powers, he increased the strength of one of the greater powers in Italy, he brought in a foreign power, he did not settle in the country, he did not send colonies.
For the first thing he weakened the Orsini and Colonnesi parties in Rome, by gaining to himself all their adherents who were gentlemen, making them his gentlemen, giving them good pay, and, according to their rank, honouring them with office and command in such a way that in a few months all attachment to the factions was destroyed and turned entirely to the duke.
When the viands and all the other entertainments that are usual in such banquets were finished, Oliverotto artfully began certain grave discourses, speaking of the greatness of Pope Alexander and his son Cesare, and of their enterprises, to which discourse Giovanni and others answered; but he rose at once, saying that such matters ought to be discussed in a more private place, and he betook himself to a chamber, whither Giovanni and the rest of the citizens went in after him.
It only remains now to speak of ecclesiastical principalities, touching which all difficulties are prior to getting possession, because they are acquired either by capacity or good fortune, and they can be held without either; for they are sustained by the ancient ordinances of religion, which are so all-powerful, and of such a character that the principalities may be held no matter how their princes behave and live.
Such things Julius not only followed, but improved upon, and he intended to gain Bologna, to ruin the Venetians, and to drive the French out of Italy. All of these enterprises prospered with him, and so much the more to his credit, inasmuch as he did everything to strengthen the Church and not any private person.
I say, therefore, that the arms with which a prince defends his state are either his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed.
Sforza had the Bracceschi always against him, so they watched each other.
They had, besides this, used every art to lessen fatigue and danger to themselves and their soldiers, not killing in the fray, but taking prisoners and liberating without ransom.
This will soon make him odious to his subjects, and becoming poor he will be little valued by any one; thus, with his liberality, having offended many and rewarded few, he is affected by the very first trouble and imperilled by whatever may be the first danger; recognizing this himself, and wishing to draw back from it, he runs at once into the reproach of being miserly.
Messer Annibale Bentivogli, who was prince in Bologna (grandfather of the present Annibale), having been murdered by the Canneschi, who had conspired against him, not one of his family survived but Messer Giovanni, who was in childhood: immediately after his assassination the people rose and murdered all the Canneschi.
Knowing the sloth of the Emperor Julian, he persuaded the army in Sclavonia, of which he was captain, that it would be right to go to Rome and avenge the death of Pertinax, who had been killed by the praetorian soldiers; and under this pretext, without appearing to aspire to the throne, he moved the army on Rome, and reached Italy before it was known that he had started.
In the beginning of his reign he attacked Granada, and this enterprise was the foundation of his dominions.
Under this same cloak he assailed Africa, he came down on Italy, he has finally attacked France; and thus his achievements and designs have always been great, and have kept the minds of his people in suspense and admiration and occupied with the issue of them.
For the Spaniards cannot resist cavalry, and the Switzers are afraid of infantry whenever they encounter them in close combat.
Much that I encountered on the way contributed, I know not how, to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken.
It was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and one for which he despaired to find a remedy—a mere nervous affection, he immediately added, which would undoubtedly soon pass off.
He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable origin—to the severe and long-continued illness—indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution—of a tenderly beloved sister, his sole companion for long years, his last and only relative on earth.
It was, however, the only book immediately at hand; and I indulged a vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of the folly which I should read.
“And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who was now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit, who, in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but, feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising of the tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made quickly room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand; and now pulling therewith sturdily, he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all asunder, that the noise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood alarumed and reverberated throughout the forest.”
At the termination of this sentence I started and, for a moment, paused; for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me)—it appeared to me that, from some very remote portion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly to my ears, what might have been, in its exact similarity of character, the echo (but a stifled and dull one certainly) of the very cracking and ripping sound which Sir Launcelot had so particularly described.
That's the tragedy of it!' he thought. 'Oh dear, oh dear!' he muttered despairingly, as he recalled the most painful details of the quarrel.
He could no longer find forgetfulness in sleep, at any rate not before night, could not go back to the music and the songs of the little decanter-women, consequently he must seek forgetfulness in the dream of life.
He tore open the telegram and read it, guessing at the words, which (as so often happens in telegrams) were misspelt, and his face brightened.
'Ah, Matthew!' he said, shaking his head.
WHEN HE WAS QUITE DRESSED Oblonsky sprinkled some scent on himself, pulled down his cuffs, and as usual distributing in different pockets his cigarette-case, matches, pocket-book, and the watch with its double chain and bunch of charms, he shook out his handkerchief, and feeling clean, sweet, healthy, and physically bright in spite of his misfortune, went with a slight spring in each step into the dining-room where his coffee stood ready. Beside the coffee lay letters and papers from the Office.
'Yes, yes,' and stroking her shoulder he kissed her hair at the roots and her neck, and let her go.
He expanded his chest, took out a cigarette, lit it, took two whiffs, then threw it into a pearl-shell ash-tray, and crossing the drawing-room with rapid steps, he opened the door which led into his wife's bedroom.
She felt that it was impossible for her to leave; but still deceiving herself, she went an sorting the things and pretending that she really would go.
'What's that to do with me?
Her eyes drooped and she waited to hear what he would say, as if entreating him to persuade her somehow that she had made a mistake.
She tried again and again to speak and could not.
Then she rose quickly and moved toward the door.
That's a good phrase,' he thought. 'I must use that.'
Oblonsky put on his fur coat, and went out into the porch.
'Enough or not, we shall have to manage, that's clear,' said Matthew, closing the carriage door and stepping back into the porch.
Having arrived at his destination, Oblonsky; respectfully followed by the door-keeper bearing his portfolio, entered his little private room, put on his uniform, and came out into the Office.
Levin, at last!' he said, scrutinizing the approaching Levin with a friendly mocking smile. 'How is it you deign to look me up in this den?' he asked; and not contented with pressing his friend's hand, he kissed him.
Similarly, Levin in his heart despised the town life his friend was leading, and his official duties which he considered futile and ridiculed.
'That'll be all right!' said Levin and left the room, only recollecting when already at the door that he had not taken leave of Oblonsky's colleagues.
Levin listened no longer but sat waiting for the professor to go.
Do you know?' Levin rose from his chair as if meaning to go at once.
'He evidently wants to offend me,' continued Koznyshev,' but he cannot do that. I wish with all my heart I could help him, but I know it can't be done.'
She was not very firm on her feet. Having drawn her hands from the muff that hung by a cord from her neck, she held them out and looking at Levin, whom she had recognized, she smiled at him and at her fears.
Having turned the corner, she pushed off with an elastic little foot, glided straight up to Shcherbatsky, and catching hold of him with her hand, nodded smilingly to Levin.
She looked attentively at him as if wishing to understand his confusion.
He stood up, took off his overcoat, and having given himself a start on the rough ice near the shelter, glided down to the smooth surface of the lake, increasing and diminishing his speed and shaping his course as if by volition only.
He then took off his skates and overtook mother and daughter at the gates of the Gardens.
WHEN THEY ENTERED THE RESTAURANT Levin could not help noticing something peculiar in his friend's expression, a kind of suppressed radiance in his face and whole figure. Oblonsky took off his overcoat, and with his hat on one side walked into the dining-room, giving his orders to the Tartar waiters, in their swallow-tail coats, with napkins under their arms, who attached themselves to him. Bowing right and left to his acquaintances who, here as elsewhere, greeted him joyfully, he passed on to the buffet, drank a glass of vodka and ate a bit of fish as hors-d'oeuvre, and said something to the painted Frenchwoman, bedecked with ribbons and lace, who sat at a little counter – something that made even this Frenchwoman burst into frank laughter.
'They may be Flensburg, but are they fresh?'
'Printanier,' chimed in the waiter.
'Cachet blanc,' chimed in the waiter.
'Possibly; but still it seems to me strange that while we country people try to get over our meals as quickly as we can, so as to be able to get on with our work, here you and I try to make our meal last as long as possible, and therefore eat oysters.'
'Wait a bit: you must take some sauce,' said Oblonsky, stopping Levin's hand that was pushing away the sauce-boat.
My wife is a most wonderful woman...' He sighed, remembering his relations with his wife; then after a minute's pause he continued: 'She has the gift of clairvoyance.
LEVIN EMPTIED HIS GLASS and they were silent for a while.
I can't drink any more,' said Levin pushing his glass aside, 'or I shall be tipsy... Well, and how are you getting on?' he continued, evidently wishing to change the subject.
You have a consistent character yourself and you wish all the facts of life to be consistent, but they never are.
The Princess with a woman's way of talking round the question said that Kitty was too young, that Levin had not shown that his intentions were serious, that Kitty was not in love with him, and so on; but she did not say the most important things, namely that she expected a better match for her daughter, that she did not like Levin and did not understand him.
But to her mother they appeared in a different light.
BUT JUST AT THAT moment the Princess came in.
'Why, of course, I always write them down.
Having greeted and spoken a few words to every one else, he sat down without having once looked at Levin, who had not taken his eyes off him.
Noticing that the Countess Nordston wished to say something, he stopped without finishing what he was saying, and listened attentively to her.
'Ah, Countess, you must really take me there. For goodness' sake take me to them!
'For this reason,' Levin again interrupted him, 'that with electricity, you need only rub a piece of resin against wool, and you will always produce a certain phenomenon, but this other does not always act, so it is not a natural force.'
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, but in my opinion playing at hunt the ring is more amusing,' said the old Prince, looking at Vronsky and guessing that he had started the thing. 'After all there is some sense in "Hunting the ring."-'
He went straight to his rooms at the Hotel Dusseau, had supper, and after undressing had hardly laid his head on his pillow before he was fast asleep.
He apologized for being in her way and was about to enter the carriage, but felt compelled to have another look at her, not because she was very beautiful nor because of the elegance and modest grace of her whole figure, but because he saw in her sweet face as she passed him something specially tender and kind.
'Oh, if you had seen it, Countess,' said Oblonsky. And his wife was there...
At last she pulled the button off and put it into her pocket.
Her bright eyes under their thick lashes suddenly filled with tears.
Dolly looked at her inquiringly.
He is ashamed of the children, and that, loving you... yes, yes, loving you more than anything else in the world,' she hurriedly went on, not listening to Dolly who was about to reply, 'he has hurt you, hit you so hard. He kept saying, ' "No, no, she will not forgive me!"-'
After dinner, when Dolly had gone to her own room, Anna got up quickly and went to her brother who was just lighting a cigar.
'All together!' said Anna laughing and running to meet them, and putting her arms round them she tumbled the whole heap of children – struggling and shrieking joyfully – on to the floor.
While they were talking about their mutual Petersburg acquaintances Anna rose suddenly.
'Papers from the office for me, I expect,' said Oblonsky.
When Anna returned with her album he had already gone, and Oblonsky was saying that Vronsky had called to inquire about a dinner they were giving next day to a celebrity who was visiting Moscow, but that he could not be induced to come in. 'He seemed so queer,' added Oblonsky.
There was nothing extraordinary or strange in the fact that a man had called at half-past nine at a friend's house to ask about a dinner they were planning and that he would not come in; but it seemed strange to all of them.
When, just before entering the ball-room, her mother wished to put straight a twisted end of her sash, Kitty drew slightly back: she felt that everything on her must be naturally right and graceful and that there was no need to adjust anything.
'No, I am not going to throw the first stone,' she was saying in reply to some question, adding, with a shrug of her shoulders, 'although I cannot understand it'; and at once she turned to Kitty with a tender protecting smile.
He came up to Kitty, reminding her of the first quadrille and regretting that he had not seen her for such a long time.
Kitty, while gazing with admiration at Anna waltzing, listened to him, expecting him to ask her to waltz, but he did not do so and she glanced at him with surprise.
That he did not ask her for the mazurka while they were dancing the quadrille did not disturb her.
She was sure that she would dance the mazurka with him as at previous balls, and she refused five other partners for that dance, saying that she was already engaged.
Vronsky and Anna sat almost opposite to her.
And yet I, instead of looking him up, dined out and came here.' Levin went up to a lamp-post and read his brother's address which he had in his pocket-book, and then hired a sledge.
'I will tell him everything, I will get him to tell me everything. I will show him that I love and therefore understand him,' Levin decided in his mind, as toward eleven o'clock he drove up to the hotel of which he had the address.
Constantine hardly listened.
This is why!' suddenly shouted Nicholas at the mention of the name. 'This is why.
Meanwhile Mary Nikolavna had come back.
She hurried up to him and said something in a whisper.
Left alone with Mary Nikolavna, Levin spoke to her.
Mary Nikolavna gave a mild, kindly smile, which evoked one from Nicholas, and she took away the bottle.
No one but the magistrate, when she was tried for an attempt to escape from the house of ill fame, ever spoke to her so politely... Oh heavens, how senseless everything is in this world!' he suddenly exclaimed.
First of all he decided that he would no longer hope for the exceptional happiness which marriage was to have given him, and consequently he would not underrate the present as he had done.
'Show a light here, Theodore, here,' said Levin, examining the calf. 'Like its mother,' he said, 'although the colour is its father's; very fine, big-boned and deep-flanked.
He lifted his head and pondered. Old Laska, who had not yet quite digested her joy at her master's return and had run out to bark in the yard, now came back, bringing a smell of fresh air with her into the room and, wagging her tail, she approached him and putting her head under his hand whined plaintively, asking to be patted.
Levin looked at her intently, surprised that she knew so well what was in his mind.
And to show that all was now well and satisfactory, she slightly opened her mouth, smacked her sticky lips, and drawing them more closely over her old teeth lay still in blissful peace.
With her deft little hands she unlocked her red bag, took out a small pillow which she placed on her knees, and locked the bag again; then she carefully wrapped up her feet and sat down comfortably.
To get over it she rose, threw off her wrap, and took off the cape of her coat.
And this too struck her as amusing.
She took another deep breath to get her fill of fresh air and had already drawn her hand out of her muff to take hold of the handrail and get into the train when another man wearing a military overcoat came close between her and the wavering light of the lamp.
She was particularly struck by the feeling of dissatisfaction with herself which she experienced when she met him. It was that ordinary well-known feeling, as if she were dissembling, which she experienced in regard to her husband, but formerly she had not noticed it, while now she was clearly and painfully conscious of it.
He ordered his German valet, who had run up from a second-class carriage, to get his luggage and take it home, and he himself went up to her.
She glanced at her husband to see whether he knew Vronsky.
Karenin looked at him with displeasure, absently trying to recall who he might be.
Now I shan't have to dine alone,' he went on, no longer in a bantering manner. 'You can't think how I used...'
She unpacked the presents which Dolly's children had sent him, and told him that there was a girl in Moscow whose name was Tanya, who could read and even teach other children.
She then went on to tell her of other unpleasantnesses, and of the underhand opposition to the plan for uniting the Churches, and she went away in a hurry, as she had that afternoon to be at a meeting of another society as well as to attend a Slavonic Committee meeting.
Exactly at five – the bronze clock (style of Peter I) had not finished striking – Karenin entered in evening dress with a white tie and two stars on his coat, as he had to attend an official meeting directly after dinner.
But have a wash and smarten yourself up,' said the Baroness, again sitting down and carefully turning a small screw of the coffee-pot. 'Pierre, pass me the coffee,' she said to Petritsky whom, not concealing their relations, she called Pierre (the French for Peter), because of his surname.
But, in general, everything was first-rate and extremely jolly; and without letting his friend go into the details of his position Petritsky began telling him all the interesting news.
"Here, this is one of the new ones," says the Grand Duchess, turning it over, and – just fancy! – out tumbles a pear and sweets – two pounds of them!... The dear fellow had collected them in his helmet!'
She answered him, but suddenly grew angry and rose.
Added to this the care of a large family worried her continually: either something went wrong with the feeding of the baby or the nurse left, or, as now, one of the children fell ill.
'No, he is always preparing to go.'
I'm all obedience,' he said to his wife, as he sat down again. 'And look here, Kate,' he went on, turning to his youngest daughter: 'You must wake up one fine morning and say to yourself "Why, I am quite well and happy, and will go out to walk in the frost again with Papa."
'Alexander, Alexander,' she whispered, moving nearer and bursting into tears.
As soon as she began to cry the Prince quieted down, and came up to her.
When the Prince flared up she kept silent, feeling shame for her mother and tenderness toward her father because of his immediate return to kindliness; but when her father left the room she was ready for the chief thing needful, which was to go to Kitty and comfort her.
The mention of Levin seemed to deprive Kitty of the last fragments of self-control: she jumped up from her chair, threw the buckle on the floor, and rapidly gesticulating with her hands she began:
The maid, quite bewildered, carries on the negotiations.
The Titular Councillor lodges a complaint, and I turn into a peacemaker – and what a peacemaker!...
The hostess sat down beside the samovar and took off her gloves.
Anna rose and went up to Betsy.
'Friends we shall not be, you know that yourself; but whether we shall be the happiest or the most miserable of human beings... rests with you.'
Noticing the unpleasant impression produced on every one, the Princess Betsy manoeuvred for some one else to take her place and to listen to Karenin, and she herself went up to Anna.
Karenin was being confronted with life – with the possibility of his wife's loving somebody else, and this seemed stupid and incomprehensible to him, because it was life itself.
He did not undress, but paced up and down with his even step on the resounding parquet floor of the dining-room, which was lit by one lamp, over the carpet of the dark drawing-room, where a light was reflected only from a recently painted portrait of himself which hung above the sofa, and on through her sitting-room, where two candles were burning, lighting up the portraits of her relatives and friends and the elegant knick-knacks, long familiar to him, on her writing-table.
Through her room he reached the door of their bedroom and then turned back again.
A woman's steps were heard ascending the stairs.
What a wonder!' she said, throwing off her hood, and without pausing she went on to her dressing-room. 'Alexis Alexandrovich, it's high time!' she added from beyond the door.
His lips were sternly compressed and his eyes did not look at her.
Each time he began to think about it, he felt that he must try again, that by kindness, tenderness, and persuasion there was still a hope of saving her and obliging her to bethink herself. Every day he prepared himself to have a talk with her.
But the louder he spoke the lower she drooped her once proud, bright, but now dishonoured head, and she writhed, slipping down from the sofa on which she sat to the floor at his feet. She would have fallen on the carpet if he had not held her.
The shame she felt at her spiritual nakedness communicated itself to him.
At last, as though mastering herself, she sat up and pushed him away.
So that in spite of his solitary life, or rather because of it, his time was completely filled up; only occasionally he felt an unsatisfied desire to share with some one besides Agatha Mikhaylovna the thoughts that wandered through his brain – for even with her he often discussed physics, agricultural theories, and especially philosophy, which last was her favourite subject.
But don't I know,' he added laughing, 'that you always want less of everything and worse? However, this year I will not let you have your way.
He looked at the strides Mishka took dragging the enormous lumps of earth that stuck to his feet, dismounted, took the seed-basket from Vasily, and prepared to sow.
He touched up his horse and, having passed the acacia trees, saw a hired three-horse sledge coming from the station and in it a gentleman in a fur coat.
When they had reached the wood Levin got down and led Oblonsky to the corner of a mossy and marshy glade, already free from snow.
Small birds chirped and now and then flew from tree to tree.
Listen, they're coming!' Levin almost shouted, cocking his gun.
But at that moment both men heard a shrill whistle that seemed to smite on their ears; they both seized their guns, and there were two flashes and two reports at the same moment.
"That's so," responded the clerk, handing him the reins and buttoning the leather apron. "But I can congratulate you on the purchase, Mihail Ignatitch?"
'Yes, electric light,' said Levin. 'Yes, by the by, where is Vronsky now?' he asked, suddenly putting down the soap.
He did not distinguish what kind of love it was, great or small, passionate or passionless, guilty or pure (he himself, the father of a family, kept a ballet girl, and was therefore lenient in these matters): but he knew that it was a love affair which displeased those whom it is necessary to please, and he therefore disapproved of his brother's conduct.
Two officers appeared at the entrance door: one with a weak thin face, a young officer who had just joined the regiment from the Cadet Corps; the other a plump old officer with a bracelet on his arm and small eyes sunk in a bloated face.
Vronsky looked up angrily, but his face brightened at once into its characteristic look of quiet, firm kindliness.
And drawing up his blanket he threw himself back on his pillow. 'Leave me alone, Yashvin!' he said angrily to Yashvin, who was pulling the blanket off him.
Let us have a drink together! Vronsky, will you have a drink?' said Petritsky, getting up and wrapping himself to the arms in a rug of tiger-skin pattern.
He went to the partition door, held up his hands, and began singing in French, ' "There was a king in Thule!" Vronsky, will you have a drink?'
But the nearer he came the more nervous she grew.
This interference roused him to anger, a feeling he rarely experienced. 'What business is it of theirs?
And now too, having given himself a shake, he continued the current of his thoughts:
But just as he was going to step toward her, she felt his nearness, pushed away the can, and turned her hot face toward him.
He grew pale, tried to say something, but stopped, dropped her hand, and bowed his head. 'Yes, he understands its full significance,' she thought, and gratefully pressed his hand.
I will tell it you all in advance,' and an evil light came into her eyes which a minute before had been so tender. '-"Ah, you love another and have entered into a guilty union with him?"-' (mimicking her husband, she laid just such a stress on the word guilty as Karenin himself would have done). '-"I warned you of the consequences from the religious, civil, and family points of view.
'When?' he whispered, gazing rapturously at her.
He saw Bryansky, stayed with him five minutes, and drove back at a gallop.
Bonne chance!' he added smiling and went away.
Having got his right foot also in its stirrup he straightened out the double reins between his practised fingers, and Cord removed his hand.
Some of the riders were in front, some behind, when Vronsky suddenly heard a horse galloping through the mud behind him, and Makhotin on his white-legged, large-eared Gladiator went past him.
He caught sight of his mud-bespattered face, and even thought he saw him smile.
He urged on his mare and felt with joy that she easily increased her speed, and he heard the sound of Gladiator's hoofs again at the former distance behind.
Karenin thought and said that in no previous year had he had so much official business as this year; but he was not conscious of the fact that this year he invented work for himself, and that this was one of the means of keeping that compartment closed where lay his feelings for and thoughts of his family, which became more terrible the longer they lay there.
Anna, who had blushed when the boy came in, saw how distressed he was, and, rising, lifted Karenin's hand off her son's shoulder, kissed the boy, led him out on to the verandah, and returned at once.
When the four-verst steeplechase was beginning she leaned forward, and did not take her eyes off Vronsky while he went up to his horse and mounted it, and at the same time she heard her husband's repulsive, unceasing voice.
She glanced for an instant at him with a look of inquiry, and, slightly frowning, turned away again.
Karenin approached Anna and politely offered her his arm. 'Come, if you like,' he said in French; but Anna listened to what the General was saying and did not notice her husband.
'No, Alexis Alexandrovich,' she put in, 'I brought Anna here and I have promised to take her back again.'
'I will send to him and find out, and will let you know,' Betsy whispered to her.
He expected a rejoinder from her; but she remained silent, looking straight before her.
This Mlle Varenka was not exactly past her early youth, but seemed to be a person destitute of youthfulness: she might be nineteen years old or she might be thirty.
But for heaven's sake' – her look added – 'do not think that I shall force myself on you. I simply admire and love you.'
And Kitty saw that the girl really was always occupied: now taking the children of some Russian family home from the Wells, now carrying an invalid's plaid or wrapping it round her, now trying to soothe an irritable patient, now choosing and buying biscuits for some one's coffee.
But the Princess, having found out from the visitors' list that they were Nicholas Levin and Mary Ivanovna, explained to Kitty what a bad man this Levin was, and all her dreams about those two people vanished.
'What was the matter?' asked the Princess.
'Varenka,' prompted Varenka with a smile, 'everybody calls me so.'
'Well then, another one,' she said, hurriedly turning over the pages, immediately realizing that there was something particular connected with that song.
'Am I not right, you have some memory attached to that song?' asked Kitty. 'Don't tell me about it,' she added hurriedly, 'only say if I am right!'
Varenka shook her head and put her hand on Kitty's.
And it seems funny, for they did not get on well together...
'Well, come back then,' said Kitty, turning resolutely. 'How are you to-day?' she asked Petrov.
The Prince approached her, and Kitty immediately noticed in his eyes that ironical spark which so disturbed her.
'But "time is money," don't forget that,' said the Colonel.
'It serves me right, it serves me right!' Kitty began hurriedly, snatching Varenka's sunshade out of her hands, and looking past her friend's eyes.
Koznyshev listened attentively, asked questions, and, enlivened by the presence of a new listener, became quite chatty, made some pointed and weighty remarks respectfully appreciated by the young doctor, and reached that state of animation his brother so well knew, which generally followed a brilliant and lively conversation.
Koznyshev sat down by the willows, while Levin led away his horse, and, having tethered it, stepped into the immense grey-green sea of grass, so dense that the wind could not ruffle it.
Though he had caught nothing, Koznyshev did not feel bored and seemed in the best of spirits.
He remained silent awhile, lifted his rod and threw the line again, and then turned to his brother with a smile.
I am not going to cut anybody's throat so I shall never be in need of that sort of thing.
They all looked at him, but no one made any remark until a tall old man with a shrivelled, beardless face, wearing a sheepskin jacket, stepped out on to the road and addressed him:
But just at that moment Titus stopped of his own accord, stooped, took up some grass and wiped his scythe with it.
Levin followed, trying not to lag behind, but it became harder and harder until at last the moment came when he felt he had no strength left, and then Titus again stopped and began whetting his scythe.
They came to the end of another swath.
When the old man got up and, having said grace, lay down beneath the willows with an armful of grass under his head, Levin did the same, regardless of the flies, importunate and persistent in the sunshine, and of the crawling insects that tickled his perspiring face and body. He at once fell asleep, waking only when the sun touched the opposite side of the willows and reached him.
He went in front, mowed a swath, turned round and restarted; following him all the others took their places, going downhill along the creek and back up to the very skirts of the wood.
This, however, did not trouble the old man.
MASHKIN HEIGHTS WERE MOWN, and the peasants, having completed their last swaths, put on their coats and went home in high spirits.
Koznyshev shook his head as he looked at his brother. 'Go, go and be quick!' he added with a smile, as, gathering together his books, he prepared to go too.
Koznyshev smiled as he looked at him
'I see that on the whole you are well satisfied with your day.'
Levin listened to his brother but understood absolutely nothing and did not wish to understand.
It's true Alesha did not stand very well: he kept turning round to see the back of his jacket; but nevertheless he was wonderfully sweet.
'Of course I understood that this only meant you wanted to see me, and was very pleased.
Children, who will race the horses with me?'
And as she looked at his easy, strong, considerate, careful and ultra-cautious movements, the mother lost her fears and looked at them with a smile of approval.
'Please, please don't let us talk about it!' said he, sitting down again, conscious as he did so that a hope which he had thought dead and buried was waking and stirring within him.
Then he went there himself and arranged to have the harvest gathered in partly by hired labourers and partly by peasants paid in kind.
Levin arrived at his sister's village at noon and left his horse with a friendly old peasant, the husband of his brother's nurse. Wishing to hear particulars of the hay harvest from this old man, Levin went to speak to him in his apiary.
'The last one, father,' shouted the lad, reining in the horse and smilingly turning to a rosy young woman who, also smiling, sat inside the cart; then he drove on again.
One of the women with a strange gruff voice started a song and sang it to the end, when fifty powerful voices, some gruff and others shrill, all at once took it up with a will.
'What's that? Who can it be coming?' thought he, hearing the tinkling of bells and raising his head.
He looked up at the sky, hoping to find there the shell he had been admiring, which had typified for him the reflections and feelings of the night.
Being aware of this and of the fact that any expression he could at that moment find for his feelings would be incompatible with the situation, he tried to conceal all signs of life within himself and neither moved nor looked at her.
What Karenin experienced was a feeling of this kind: it had been a strange and terrible pain, but it was past, and he felt he could again live, and think of other things beside his wife.
'I ought not to be unhappy because a despicable woman has committed a crime, but I must find the best way out of this painful situation in which she has placed me. And find it I will,' said he to himself, frowning more and more.
He closed his eyes... 'and it turned out that I had killed him...' and he shook his head to drive away the stupid thought. 'What sense is there in killing a man in order to define one's relations with a guilty wife and a son?
Karenin saw that in his own case it would be impossible to obtain a legal divorce – that is, a divorce in which the guilty wife would be simply cast off.
Having folded the letter, smoothed it out with a massive ivory paper-knife, and put it and the money in an envelope – with the pleasure that the use of his well-arranged writing appliances always caused him – he rang.
He tried to read but could not awaken in himself the lively interest he had felt for the Eugubine Tables.
The complication was this: Karenin's official peculiarity, his characteristic trait (every successful official has his special trait), which together with his determined ambition, self-restraint, honesty, and self-confidence, had made him successful, consisted in a contempt for red-tape, a curtailment of correspondence, economy, and (as far as possible) a direct relation with real facts.
After walking up and down the room he again looked at the portrait, frowned, and smiled contemptuously.
She remained in the same position with head and arms drooping. Every now and then her whole body shuddered as she tried to make some movement or to say something and then became rigid again.
She jumped up and began pacing up and down the room.
She dressed quickly and with determined steps entered the drawing-room, where Serezha and his governess were waiting breakfast for her as usual.
The governess began to give a long and detailed account of his misconduct, but Anna did not listen to her. She was wondering whether to take her also or not.
The tears were already streaming down her cheeks, and in order to hide them she jumped up abruptly and went out on to the verandah.
She thought of his calmness, and a feeling of vexation with him made her tear the paper to pieces, with the one sentence written on it. 'There is no need to write anything,' she thought, closed her blotting-book, went upstairs to tell the governess and the servants that she was going to Moscow that evening, and then began packing.
A packet of new still unfolded notes in a paper band fell out.
He stopped at the door, took off his cap, and let her pass.
It's just as if you thought my company might compromise you! Please bring us tea in the little drawing-room,' she said to the footman, screwing up her eyes as she always did when speaking to a footman.
'Ah!' said Anna, in an indifferent tone as if she cared very little about it, and went on with a smile: 'How could your company compromise anyone?' This play with words, this concealment of a secret, had a great charm for Anna, as it has for all women.
I must leave you for a minute; please close the envelope and send it,' she said from the doorway; 'I have some orders to give.'
I shall be there at six.' She closed it, and Betsy returning sent it off in her presence.
Betsy looked at her with smiling eyes.
Looking into those eyes every one felt as if they knew her perfectly, and knowing her could not help loving her. At the sight of Anna her whole face lit up with a joyful smile.
After reading over the list of his debts, he divided them into three classes, each of which he noted down separately.
And slowly twisting his moustache he rose from the table and walked across the room.
Vronsky looked at his comrade without answering, thinking about something else.
His smiling eyes shone still more brightly.
After returning to the table, the Commander again came forward with a glass of champagne in his hand and announced a toast: 'To the health of our late comrade, the gallant General, Prince Serpukhovskoy!
Serpukhovskoy was lifted and tossed by the officers.
Look at Mazankov, at Krupov!
A vague sense of the accomplished cleaning up of his affairs, a vague memory of Serpukhovskoy's friendship for him, and the flattering thought that the latter considered him a necessary man, and above all the anticipation of the coming meeting, merged into one general feeling of joyful vitality.
He put down his legs, threw one of them over the other, and placing his arm across it felt its firm calf, where he had hurt it in the fall the day before, and then, throwing himself back, sighed deeply several times.
Why? Why has she given me an appointment here, in a letter from Betsy?' he thought; but there was no longer any time for thinking.
'I understand, I understand,' he interrupted, taking the note but not reading it, and trying to soothe her. 'I only want one thing, I only ask for one thing: to destroy this situation in order to devote my life to your happiness.'
She stopped and burst into sobs.
When the Reports had been heard, Karenin in his quiet thin voice informed the meeting that he wished to bring to their notice some considerations of his own on the question of the settlement of the native races, and the attention of the meeting turned to him.
When he saw her he was about to rise, but changed his mind as his face flushed – a thing Anna had never seen it do before. However, he quickly rose and came toward her, looking not at her eyes but at her forehead and hair.
Seeing that he had not the strength to begin, she began for him.
And I shan't be back to dinner.' He rose and went toward the door.
After showing the coachman to a place in a lean-to, in a large, clean, tidy, newly-constructed yard where stood some charred wooden ploughs, the old man invited Levin to enter the house.
In the midst of his conversation about his acquaintanceship with Sviyazhsky the gates creaked again, and the labourers returning from the fields came into the yard with their ploughs and harrows.
Don't let the gelding out, Fedot, lead him to the trough. We'll harness another.'
Sviyazhsky sat sideways, leaning his elbow on the table and turning his cup round with one hand, while with the other he gathered his beard together, lifted it to his nose as if smelling it, and let it go again.
The peasants come along, and say, "Be a father to us! Help us!"
Well, of course they are all our own people, our neighbours: one pities them, and lends them what they want, enough to pay the one-third then due, but one says, "Remember, lads! I help you, and you must help me when necessary – at the oat-sowing or haymaking, at harvest time; and one agrees for so much work from each family."
Mary, send us some curds and whey or some raspberries here,' said Sviyazhsky to his wife. 'This year the raspberries are lasting an extraordinarily long time,' and Sviyazhsky got up cheerfully and moved away, evidently regarding the conversation as finished at the very point where to Levin it seemed to be just beginning.
Sviyazhsky got down the books and settled himself in a rocking-chair.
They agreed that an English plough ploughed better, that a scarifier worked quicker, but they found a thousand reasons why they could not use either the one or the other; and, though he was convinced that it would be necessary to lower his standards of farming, he disliked having to give up improvements the benefit of which was so clear.
But rain set in, making it impossible to get in what remained of the corn and potatoes, stopped all the work, and even prevented the delivery of the wheat.
He rose and began to pace up and down the room.
Nicholas dressed carefully, a thing he never used to do, brushed his thin, straight hair and went smiling upstairs.
These two men were so near akin and so intimate with one another, that between them the least movement or intonation expressed more than could be said in words.
He lit a candle, got up carefully, went to the looking-glass, and began examining his face and hair.
He opened his mouth: his double teeth were beginning to decay.
Levin felt it, returned behind the partition, and put out the candle, but was long unable to sleep.
It may be utopian; but granting the possibility of making a tabula rasa of the past – and abolishing private property and families – then labour comes by its own.
THE KARENINS, HUSBAND AND WIFE, continued to live in the same house and to meet daily, but they were wholly estranged.
Yes, yes, the peasant, the beater – I think he was small and dirty with a tangled beard – was stooping down and doing something or other, and suddenly began to say strange words in French. That is all there was in that dream,' he thought.
He rang for his valet, dressed hurriedly, and went out into the porch, having quite forgotten his dream and feeling worried only by the fact that he was late.
'He had been and had come back, and afterwards went somewhere else.
'I have long since abandoned that kind of life,' he said, wondering at the change in her face and trying to penetrate its meaning. 'And I must own,' he went on smiling and showing his compact row of teeth, 'that I seem to have been looking in a mirror the whole of this week while watching that kind of life, and it was very unpleasant.'
She drew up her face, half closed her eyes and quickly changed the expression of her face, folding her hands; and Vronsky saw at once upon her beautiful face the very look with which Karenin had bowed to him.
He dressed in haste, and as if he were carrying a cup brimful of wrath and were afraid of spilling any and of losing with his anger the energy he needed for an explanation with his wife, he went to her room as soon as he knew that she was up.
Astonished and abashed, she silently looked at him.
And he was about to go, but now she stopped him.
The assistant took the card and, though he evidently did not approve of what he read on it, went out of the room.
'You know my name?' continued Karenin.
'Although the general outline of our laws relating to this matter is known to me,' continued Karenin, 'I should like to know the forms in which such cases are conducted in practice.'
'In the following cases: physical defect in husband or wife, five years' absence without news' – and he bent one of his short hairy fingers – 'and in cases of adultery,' he uttered the word with evident pleasure. 'These are subdivided as follows,' and he went on bending down his thick fingers, though the cases and the subdivisions evidently could not be classed together, 'physical defects in husband or in wife, and adultery of husband or of wife.'
But Karenin remained silent, and so he began again: 'The most usual, simple, and reasonable way I consider to be adultery by mutual consent.
'If it is so...' Karenin began, growing suddenly pale; but at that moment the other suddenly rose and went to the door to speak to his assistant, who had again come to interrupt him.
Three months later the committee sent in its report.
There was a split in the Committee.
Karenin unfolded the rug he had wrapped round his legs, which were so sensitive to the cold, got out of the carriage, and making his way through the snow approached Dolly.
'Then you will come?' cried Dolly.
Oblonsky listened to Levin with attention.
Just think! This whole world of ours is only a speck of mildew sprung up on a tiny planet; yet we think we can have something great – thoughts, actions!
There must be some misunderstanding!' said Oblonsky.
I don't see it.
'You have killed a bear, I hear?' said Kitty, vainly trying to catch a wayward, slippery pickled mushroom with her fork, and so shaking the lace of her sleeve through which her arm gleamed white. 'Have you any bears near your estate?' she added, turning her lovely little head toward him and smiling.
'I am not expressing my opinion of either kind of education,' replied Koznyshev, smiling at him condescendingly as at a child and holding out his glass. 'All I say is that both sides have weighty arguments in their favour,' he continued addressing himself to Karenin.
For instance, it ought to consider the education of women injurious, yet it established courses of lectures and universities for women.'
Karenin expressed the view that the higher education of women is generally confounded with the question of women's emancipation, and that was the only reason for considering it injurious.
'You are quite right,' said Karenin. 'I think the only question is whether they are capable of fulfilling these duties.'
'Yes, but what is a girl to do if she has no home?' said Oblonsky, agreeing with Pestsov and supporting him, and thinking of the dancer Chibisova, whom he had in his mind all the time.
And fancy!' she went on in a whisper, 'he was so sorry for her that he stopped and helped her to nurse the children.
'Yes? it was wonderful! he is splendid!' said Dolly, looking toward Turovtsyn who felt that he was being talked about, and giving him a gentle smile.
'Alexis Alexandrovich, forgive me, I have no right to... but I love Anna like a sister, and respect her and I beg, I implore you to tell me what has happened between you, what do you accuse her of?'
'I have thought, Darya Alexandrovna, and have thought deeply,' said Karenin. His face flushed in blotches and his dim eyes looked straight at her.
She stood in the doorway with Shcherbatsky and was looking at him.
Sometimes the reverse happens; one at last mentions the thing one likes, for the sake of which one has been devising arguments, and if this is said well and sincerely, one's opponent suddenly agrees and ceases to dispute.
There was a pause. She still continued drawing on the table with the chalk.
'Oh, I have scribbled over the whole table!' she said, and putting down the chalk moved as if to get up.
'There,' he said, and wrote the following letters, – W, y, a: i, c, n, b; d, y, m, t, o, n?
She glanced seriously at him and then, leaning her frowning forehead on her hand, began reading.
He seized the chalk with nervous, trembling fingers, broke it, and wrote the initial letters of the following: 'I have nothing to forget or forgive, I never ceased to love you.'
It turned out that Egor had a family, three boys and a girl who was a seamstress and whom he wanted to marry to an assistant in a harness business.
He took the piece out of his mouth, put on his overcoat and went out to walk about again.
'And I,' she said. 'Even when...' she stopped, and again went on, her truthful eyes looking into his face resolutely, 'even when I drove my happiness from me I always loved you only, but I was carried away.
He had thought that his courtship would be quite unlike any other, that the ordinary conditions of courtship would spoil his peculiar happiness; but he ended by doing what others do, and his happiness was thereby only increased, becoming more and more peculiar to him, unlike anyone else's was or is.
Rising, he began to pace the room. 'Quos vult perdere dementat,' he thought, quos being those who had had a hand in making the appointment.
I shall die easier for your forgiveness,' he read.
But what can they be aiming at?
With the sense of fatigue and want of cleanliness resulting from a night spent in a railway carriage, Karenin drove through the fog of a Petersburg morning, along the deserted Nevsky, looking straight before him and not thinking of what awaited him.
The sight of Vronsky's tears made Karenin aware of the approach of that mental perturbation which other people's visible sufferings always aroused in him, and turning away his head he went toward the door without heeding what Vronsky was saying.
And I shall go to Rome, there is a wilderness there and then I shall be in nobody's way. I shall only take Serezha and the little girl...
They have come again, why don't they go away?...
How badly those flowers are drawn, not a bit like violets,' and she pointed to the wallpaper.
That day Karenin went out into the boudoir where Vronsky sat, and having locked the door took a seat opposite him.
'That is my position. You may trample me in the mud, make me the laughing-stock of the world, – I will not forsake her and will never utter a word of reproach to you,' continued Karenin.
Returning home after the three sleepless nights, Vronsky did not undress but lay down prone on a sofa, with his head on his folded arms.
He rose from the sofa, took off his coat, loosened the strap, and, baring his shaggy chest to breathe more freely, walked across the room. 'That's how one goes mad,' he said again, 'and how one shoots oneself so as not to be ashamed,' he concluded slowly.
Going up to a door he closed it, then with fixed gaze and tightly clenched teeth, approached the table, took up his revolver, examined it, turned it to a loaded chamber, and pondered.
It was close to him but he sought it further away.
When the child was pacified and laid in her deep cot, and the nurse after smoothing the little pillow went away, Karenin rose, and stepping with difficulty on tiptoe approached the infant.
He was vexed with his wife for not troubling about the charming baby, felt disinclined to go in and see her while in that frame of mind, and also disinclined to meet the Princess Betsy; but his wife might think it strange if he did not come in as usual, and so he mastered himself and went to her bedroom.
'But your face looks feverish,' said he, emphasizing the word feverish.
I can't receive him, and it would lead...' She stopped suddenly and glanced inquiringly at her husband, who was not looking at her.
No need whatever!' And she pressed her lips together and lowered her glistening eyes, looking at his hands with their swollen veins, which he was slowly rubbing together.
'Forgive me, I am upset! I am unjust,' she went on, controlling herself.
'Never mind, we'll spread out something to catch you.
Anna looked at him with dreamy, shining eyes but said nothing.
Karenin stopped. He made no reply, but the expression of submissive self-sacrifice on his face struck Oblonsky.
'I intended to talk to you about my sister and your mutual position,' said Oblonsky, still struggling with his unwonted timidity.
Oblonsky returned the letter and went on looking at his brother-in-law with the same amazement, not knowing what to say.
'Yes, yes, I understand you,' he brought out at last.
He looked at her silently, his broad jaws set, while she bandaged him.
His wound was quite healed and he went about making preparations for his journey to Tashkend. 'Only to see her once more, and then to bury myself, to die!' he thought, as he was making a round of farewell calls, and he expressed this thought to Betsy.
Without seeing anyone or anything he ran up the stairs and entered her room with hurried steps – almost at a run.
His passion communicated itself to her.
'Yes, you have taken possession of me and I am yours,' she brought out at last, pressing his hands to her bosom.
Consequently, having decided to divide her daughter's trousseau into two parts, a lesser and a larger, the Princess eventually consented to have the wedding before Advent.
As was nearly always the case just then, they had nothing to say to each other, and she had put her hand on the table and kept opening and closing it until she herself began to laugh at its motions. He remembered how he had kissed the hand and afterwards examined the converging lines on the rosy palm.
The sealed-up thoughts began stirring in Levin's head, but he hastened to drive them away. 'It will get settled somehow,' he thought, and went to the ambo.
On going up the steps and turning to the right he saw the priest.
How could it all be, without a Creator?' he asked, with an inquiring glance at Levin.
'You are entering upon a time of life,' the priest went on, 'when you must choose your path and keep to it, so pray that God in His goodness may help you and have mercy on you!' he concluded. 'May the Lord our God Jesus Christ, in the goodness and bounty of His love for mankind, pardon thee...'; and having pronounced the absolution, the priest blessed him and let him go.
Now you like farming sport... Well, you just wait and see!'
And leave them to do as they please here,' said Chirikov, smiling.
Soon after dinner the visitors left to get ready for the wedding.
'Are you mad?' she exclaimed, flushing with vexation; but his face was so piteous that she suppressed her vexation, and throwing the dresses on a chair sat down closer to him.
Dolly did the same, then she hurried away and again became confused about the arrangements for the carriages.
Levin meanwhile, in trousers but without coat or waistcoat, was pacing up and down his room, perpetually putting his head out at the door and glancing up the corridor.
'Yes, it is stupid,' Oblonsky concurred with a soothing smile. 'But don't worry, it will be here in a minute.'
'That won't help matters,' remarked Oblonsky, smiling and following without haste. 'It will all "shape itself," all "shape itself'...
Dolly advanced and was about to say something, but could not speak and began crying and laughing in an unnatural manner.
Oblonsky stepped up cautiously, whispered something to him, made a sign to Levin, and stepped back again.
Then he gave them the candles, took the censer, and slowly stepped away from them.
'Is it really true?' thought Levin, and glanced round at his bride.
They prayed: 'That they may live in chastity for the good of the fruits of the womb, and find joy in their sons and daughters.' It was declared that God had created woman from Adam's rib, and that 'For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh'; and that 'This is a great mystery.'
Levin glanced round at her, was struck by the joyous radiance of her face, and was involuntarily infected by her feeling.
A handsome head-waiter, his thick hair greased with pomatum and parted from the nape upward, dressed in a swallow-tail coat, with a wide lawn shirt-front and a bundle of charms dangling on his rotund stomach, with his hands in his pockets, his eyes screwed up contemptuously, was answering a bystander's questions in a severe tone.
Hearing steps ascending the stairs at the other side of the entrance, the waiter turned and recognized the Russian Count who occupied the best rooms in the hotel. He respectfully took his hands out of his pockets, bowed, and said that the courier had been, and that the business of renting the palazzo was settled.
Well, and what are you doing?'
After trying several topics of conversation she led him on to the subject of art, about which he talked very well, and listened to him with attention.
'Shut up, for heaven's sake!' cried Mikhaylov with tears in his voice, stopping his ears with his hands as he went into his workroom behind a partition and locked the door behind him. 'What a duffer!' he muttered to himself as he seated himself at the table, and having opened a portfolio he at once set to work with particular ardour at an unfinished drawing.
Having made it up with his wife he put on an olive-green overcoat with a velvet collar, and a hat, and went to the studio.
'Come in, please!' he said, trying to put on an air of indifference, as he entered the hall and took a key from his pocket to unlock the door.
He wished to say that it was just so that he understood Pilate, but his trembling lips would not obey him and he was unable to speak.
'Yes, yes, wonderful!' chimed in Golenishchev and Anna. In spite of his elation, this remark about technique grated painfully on Mikhaylov's heart, and, glancing angrily at Vronsky, he suddenly frowned.
But without that occupation his life and Anna's – who was surprised at his disenchantment – appeared very dull in the Italian town. All of a sudden the palazzo became so obviously old and dirty, so disagreeably familiar were the stains on the curtains, the cracks in the floor, the cracked stuccoes of the cornices, and so wearisome became Golenishchev, the Italian professor, and the German traveller, who were also always the same, that a change was necessary.
He went on with his work with a feeling that the centre of gravity of his attention had shifted, and that he consequently saw the matter differently and with greater clearness.
'Nothing, I only wanted to make you turn round,' said she, gazing at him and trying to discover whether he was vexed at the interruption.
I shan't go anywhere, especially not to Moscow.'
'Read it... Dolly writes about you,' Kitty began with a smile, but paused suddenly, noticing the changed expression on her husband's face.
He had expected to feel the same sorrow at the loss of a loved brother and the same horror of death he had then experienced, but to a greater degree, and had prepared himself for all this; but what he found was quite different.
A silence followed.
He went out continually on all sorts of pretexts, coming back and going out again, incapable of remaining alone.
'I'm not looking,' she said, helping the arm in. 'Mary Nikolavna, you go round to the other side and put it right,' she added.
'There is a little bottle in my handbag,' she went on, turning to her husband. 'You know, in the side pocket!
The new doctor took out a stethoscope and sounded him, shook his head, prescribed some medicine and gave extremely precise instructions about giving the medicine and about diet.
She, however, sorted combs and brushes, and did it all in such a way that there was nothing offensive about it.
'Don't go,' said Nicholas and stretched out his hand.
He again sat up, coughed, ate and talked, no longer of death, expressed hopes of recovery, and was even more irritable and depressed than before.
'Worse,' he answered with an effort. 'It hurts!'
The doctor confirmed their supposition about Kitty. Her illness was pregnancy.
I am no longer a man!' said Karenin, releasing her hand but continuing to gaze into her tearful eyes. 'My position is terrible because I cannot find support anywhere, cannot find it even in myself.'
'It is not the loss of what no longer exists, it is not that,' continued Karenin.
Karenin frowned, and bending his hands backward began cracking his fingers.
Having caught sight, just as she entered, of the Countess Lydia Ivanovna's yellow shoulders emerging from her corset, and of her beautiful dreamy eyes summoning him, Karenin smiled, revealing his white impeccable teeth, and went up to her.
The Countess Lydia Ivanovna looked at him ecstatically, and her eyes filled with tears of rapturous admiration at the loftiness of his soul.
Serezha looked at his father with scared eyes, and could only think of whether his father would make him repeat what he had just said, as he sometimes did.
'But I don't consider that she has fallen lower than hundreds of people whom you do receive!' said Vronsky still more gloomily, and rose in silence, having understood that his sister-in-law's determination was final.
'He is not up yet,' said the hall-porter, carefully scrutinizing her face.
While saying this he was again falling asleep.
She tried to speak simply and cheerfully, but could not, and turned away again.
He pressed against her in silence, and then whispered:
A waiter offered her coffee. 'Later,' she said.
The Italian nurse, having smartened up the baby girl, came in and held her out to Anna.
Rising, she removed her bonnet and took from the table an album in which were photographs of her son at different ages.
'Not long, I think,' she replied with embarrassment glancing at Vronsky.
I shall catch you up in a minute!' he shouted to Yashvin.
But Anna did not return alone, she brought with her her old maiden aunt, Princess Oblonskaya.
I love you, and it's all the same to me,' she said, changing from French into Russian, while her eyes as she looked at him glittered with a light he could not understand, 'so long as you have not changed toward me!
And what is happening to her?' he asked himself.
This conversation about horses interested him, but he never forgot Anna, and involuntarily listened to the steps in the corridor and glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece.
Left alone, Vronsky got up and began pacing the room.
He glanced around unobtrusively, but did not look at her: prepared for the worst, he looked for Karenin.
Her face looked pale and angry and she was speaking excitedly.
She was sitting in the first arm-chair by the wall, fixedly gazing before her.
'You must take me too!
I am very fond of looking for mushrooms,' he said with a glance at Varenka. 'I consider it a very good occupation.'
'In many ways you have changed since your marriage and for the better,' said Koznyshev, smiling at Kitty and apparently not much interested in his conversation with his brother; 'but you have remained true to your passion for defending the most paradoxical views.'
'Ah, well! there's no time now,' added Koznyshev as the children came running in.
We will drive there.'
'Varenka, I shall be very happy if a certain thing comes to pass,' she whispered, kissing her.
'And are you coming with us?' Varenka, quite confused, asked Levin, pretending not to have heard what had been said to her.
'No, excuse me!' her mother continued. 'And then you yourself would not let me talk it over with Vronsky.
'It's better so, Agatha Mikhaylovna: it won't ferment, and we have no ice left in the cellar and nowhere to keep it cool,' said Kitty, immediately seeing her husband's intention and addressing the old woman in the same spirit. 'On the other hand, your pickling is such that Mama says she never tasted anything like it!' she added, smiling and putting the old woman's kerchief straight.
Throwing away his cigar Koznyshev went toward her with resolute steps.
I love you, and offer you my hand.'
On seeing Koznyshev approaching she did not move; yet everything told him that she felt his approach and was glad of it.
They began to return to the children. Varenka felt pained and ashamed, but at the same time she experienced a sense of relief.
'And I know why,' continued the Princess. 'He says young married folk should be left to themselves for a while.'
He looked at Dolly, and was not pleased with her either.
He looked at the Princess, who a few moments before had seemed so nice, and did not like the way she welcomed that beribboned Vasenka, as if to her own house.
Talking noisily, they all went into the house, but as soon as all were seated Levin turned and left the room.
LEVIN DID NOT RETURN until they called him to supper.
Kostya! Wait a moment – what's the matter with you?' said Kitty, hurrying after him, but, without waiting for her, he went away pitilessly with big strides to the dining-room, where he immediately joined in the general animated conversation which was kept going by Vasenka Veslovsky and Oblonsky.
Delightful!' chimed in Veslovsky.
Veslovsky, come here!'
Meanwhile Vasenka, without the least suspicion of the sufferings his presence was causing, rose from the table after Kitty and followed her, smiling pleasantly.
Taking leave of his hostess, Vasenka again wanted to kiss her hand; but Kitty, blushing, drew away her hand, and said with naive rudeness, for which she was afterwards reprimanded by her mother:
Well, never mind!
'There, you see! You did not come to the office last night, and now you are detaining me.
It will just stretch from the bottom, you see,' he went on with a persuasive gesture, 'and go up and up till it gets there.'
'It will go up from the bottom, I mean, and reach to the top,' the carpenter repeated obstinately and persuasively.
Hold the dogs, Philip!'
He had three hundred and seventy roubles in the pocket-book, and therefore the matter could not be ignored.
Suddenly the horses started, Levin knocked his head against the barrel of some one's gun, and there was a report.
Oblonsky shook his head and laughed reproachfully at Veslovsky.
When they reached the second marsh, which was of considerable size and would take a good deal of time Levin tried to dissuade them from getting out.
After making sure he had missed, he turned and saw that the trap and horses were no longer on the road but in the marsh.
I am Automedona' – wait and see how I will drive you!' he said, keeping hold of the reins, in reply to Levin who wanted him to let the coachman drive. 'No, I must expiate my sin, and besides, it's delightful on the box,' and he was off.
It's a splendid marsh, and I see there are hawks too,' said Oblonsky, pointing at two large birds circling above the sedges. 'Where there are hawks, there is sure to be game.'
Oblonsky picked up his two snipe and looked with sparkling eyes at Levin.
They kept rising before the dogs and at the very feet of the sportsmen, and Levin might have recovered himself; but the oftener he fired the more he disgraced himself before Veslovsky, who was puffing away merrily, in and out of range, never killing anything, but not in the least abashed thereby.
'Hullo you sportsmen!' shouted one of several peasants who were sitting beside a cart from which the horses had been taken out.
Go, you'll find the way to the mill!' cried Levin, and on looking round was pleased to see Veslovsky making his way out of the marsh toward the peasants, stooping and stumbling with his weary feet and holding his gun at arm's length.
The dog continued pointing.
Levin fired, but that day he had no luck: he missed, and when he went to look for the bird he had killed, he could not find it.
The slanting rays of the sun were still hot; his clothes were wet through with perspiration and stuck to his body; his left boot, full of water, was heavy and made a smacking sound; down his face, grimy with powder, ran drops of sweat; a bitter taste was in his mouth, the smell of powder and rust was in his nose, and the perpetual cry of the snipe was in his ears; he could not touch the barrels of his gun, they were so hot; his heart thumped with short, quick beats; his hands trembled with excitement and his tired feet stumbled as he dragged them over the hummocks and through the bog; but still he went on and shot.
When he reached a dry place he sat down on a hummock, took off his boot and emptied it, then went back to the marsh, drank a little of the rusty water, wetted the heated barrels and bathed his face and hands.
'Perfectly true!' chimed in Vasenka Veslovsky. 'Perfectly true!
Levin pretended to be asleep, but Oblonsky, having put on his slippers and lit a cigar, left the barn, and their voices soon died away.
Even Laska, sleeping curled into a ring on a corner of the hay heap, got up reluctantly, and lazily stretched and adjusted first one hind leg and then the other.
The path led him straight to the marsh, which was recognizable by the mist rising from it, thicker at one spot and thinner at another, so that the sedge and willow bushes looked like islets swaying in the mist.
When he had passed the sleeping peasants and reached the first wet place, Levin examined his percussion caps and allowed Laska to go.
Here!' he said, pointing to the other side.
It sat with turned head, listening.
Another rose behind Levin without waiting to be disturbed by the dog.
'Uncle, there were ducks here yesterday!' he shouted, following Levin from afar.
Tired, hungry, and happy, Levin returned to his lodging toward ten o'clock, having tramped some thirty versts and bringing nineteen red-fleshed birds, besides a duck tied to his girdle, as there was no room for it in his bag.
The Princess began telling him, but he did not listen to her.
'Well then, Princess, let it be just as you think best,' he said, turning away.
She was walking up and down the room and speaking angrily to a little girl who stood howling in a corner:
Figurez vous que la petite...'
Consider!' she went on, laughing. 'You can go to Fanny now,' she said to Masha.
The little girl burst into sobs and buried her face in her mother's lap, and Dolly placed her thin tender hand on the child's head.
DOLLY CARRIED OUT HER INTENTION of going to see Anna.
Dolly dozed, and only woke up when approaching the inn where the horses were to be changed.
'And they are all down on Anna!
THE COACHMAN STOPPED THE HORSES and looked round toward a field of rye on the right, where some peasants sat beside a cart.
The coachman started, but hardly had they gone round the corner when the peasants called out to them.
Anna, turning her eyes away from her friend and screwing them up (this was a new habit of hers and unfamiliar to Dolly), grew thoughtful, trying thoroughly to grasp the meaning of the remark.
'They are the employees' houses, the stud farm, and the stables,' answered Anna. 'And here the park begins.
You wished to ask about her name? Am I not right?
Think of Biryuzovsky and Avenyeva... And even Nikandrov!
'You have guessed that I want to talk to you,' he said, looking at her with laughter in his eyes. 'I know that you are a friend of Anna's.'
'Oh, yes!' answered Dolly, closing her sunshade, 'but...'
She made no answer, but only looked at him. He continued:
I like my activities.
'Well, this brings me to the point of my talk,' he went on, calming himself with an effort. 'Anna can do it;. it depends on her...
Her husband was willing to have a divorce – your husband had almost arranged it – and I know he would not refuse now.
But how is it she herself does not think of it?' asked Dolly, suddenly remembering that strange new habit Anna had of screwing up her eyes. And she remembered that it was just when the intimate side of life was in question that Anna screwed up her eyes.
Vasenka Veslovsky, her husband, and even Sviyazhsky and many others whom she knew, never thought about these things, and readily believed, what every decent host wishes his guests to feel, that all that is so well arranged at his house has cost him no trouble but has come about of itself.
'Nicholas Ivanich,' she said (referring to Sviyazhsky), 'was struck by the way the new building had grown since his last visit; even I, who go there every day, am always surprised how quickly it gets on.'
'And I rather agree with your brother-in-law,' said Anna, 'though I do not go to his lengths,' she added with a smile. 'I'm afraid we have too many of these public obligations nowadays.
They intently followed the ball sent to them, neither hurrying nor hesitating, ran toward it with agility, waited for it to bounce, and then striking it with the racket sent it back across the net with good aim and precision.
'With Alexis?' said Anna. 'I know you have.
One day there are races and his horses are running; he goes.
But I could not help remembering...
These were the very arguments Dolly had put to herself, but now she listened without understanding them. 'How can one be guilty toward beings who don't exist?' thought she.
She rose, drew herself up, sighed deeply, and with her light steps began pacing up and down the room, pausing occasionally. 'I not consider it?
'I love those two beings only, and the one excludes the other!
If anyone is unhappy, it is I!' she murmured, and, turning away, she wept.
He looked at her attentively, not understanding this calm manner.
'Look here!' he would say, 'just try this – go to so-and-so, and to so-and-so.'
Then a small, very young-looking, but very venomous man began saying that probably the Marshal of the Province would be pleased to account for the Funds, and that the excessive politeness of the members of the Commission was depriving him of that moral satisfaction.
At the Marshal's table, beneath the portrait of the Emperor, discussions were in full swing.
Levin stood with his own group in the Small Hall, which was used as a refreshment and smoking room, listening to what was being said and vainly straining his mental powers to understand it all.
He was now listening to Sviyazhsky and Hlyustov, the Marshal of another district, who also belonged to their party.
And casting a discontented glance at Levin, he suddenly turned away.
The landowner also recognized Levin and they shook hands.
It is clear he will be a scholar, so that there will be no one to continue my work, and yet I go on!
'I'll tell you something,' continued the landowner. 'My neighbour, a merchant, called on me, and we went over the farm and garden together.
'We won't deny it.'
This influence was promoted by his wealth, by his title, by the splendid house in the town which had been lent him by his old acquaintance Shirkov, a financier who had founded a flourishing bank in Kashin; by the excellent chef whom he had brought from his estate; by his friendship with the Governor, who had been a former comrade and one whom Vronsky had even protected; but above all by his simple behaviour in treating every one alike which had quickly induced most of the noblemen to change their opinion as to his supposed pride.
Of course it is indefinable, intangible, but it was not so formerly, and that look means much,' she thought. 'That look shows that he is beginning to grow cold.'
Walks, talks with the Princess Barbara, visits to the hospital, and above all reading, reading one book after another, filled her time.
Whether it was that the conditions of town-life were different, or that they had both grown more careful and reasonable in this respect – at any rate in Moscow they never had quarrels resulting from jealousy such as they had feared when they moved to town.
But she at once turned to the Princess Mary Borisovna and did not once look round at Vronsky till he rose to go. Then she looked at him, but evidently only because it is impolite not to look at a man when he is bowing to you.
'I'm ready to agree with Arseny beforehand.
But afterwards, having convinced himself that they looked at the question so differently that they would never understand one another, he ceased making objections and merely listened.
Levin attributed this to his own worth, not knowing that Metrov, who had exhausted the matter with all his intimates, was particularly pleased to speak about it to any fresh person, and, in general, willingly spoke to everybody about the subject with which he was occupied and which was not yet clear to himself.
With a displeased look at Levin the student replied:
When the reader had finished, the chairman thanked him and read aloud some verses for the jubilee sent by the poet Ment, adding a few words of thanks to the poet.
'There now! I envy you for having the entrance to that interesting scientific world,' he said, and having started talking he changed, as he usually did, into French, which he spoke more easily.
Levin had forgotten the commission he had been charged with and only remembered it when on his way to the ante-room.
On going out Levin met several other acquaintances with whom he talked about politics, music, and mutual friends; among others he met Count Bol. He had quite forgotten his intended visit to him.
All seemed to have left their cares and anxieties behind them in the hall with their hats, and to be preparing to enjoy the material blessings of life at their leisure.
'Why are you so late?' asked the old Prince with a smile, holding out his hand over his shoulder. 'How is Kitty?' he added, smoothing the table-napkin, which he had tucked in behind a button of his waistcoat.
Oblonsky took a glass, and exchanging a look with a bald, red-haired man with a moustache who sat at the other end of their table, smilingly nodded to him.
Well, never mind!
Levin sat down for a while and listened, but remembering all the conversations he had that day heard, he suddenly felt terribly bored.
Though she is my sister,' Oblonsky continued, 'I may safely say that she is a remarkable woman.
How stupid that old ceremony is, walking round and round singing, "Rejoice, Isaiah!" – a ceremony in which nobody believes and which stands in the way of people's happiness!' interpolated Oblonsky. 'Well, and then their position will be as definite as mine or yours.'
'Yes; that's it exactly,' said Vorkuyev.
Again she glanced at Levin.
After a pause she smiled and said, 'Yes, yes, I never could do it. Je n'ai pas le coeur assez large [My heart is not big enough] to love a whole orphanage-full of unpleasant little girls.
About me?' Levin wondered; and he was so excited about what she might be saying to Oblonsky that he hardly listened to what Vorkuyev was telling him about the merits of Anna's story for children.
There was not a single moment when it was necessary to seek for a subject of conversation; on the contrary one felt that there was not time enough to say what one wanted to say, but willingly refrained in order to hear what she was saying.
She let go his hand and screwed up her eyes.
When he drew near she looked at him and burst into sobs.
WHEN HER VISITORS HAD TAKEN THEIR LEAVE Anna did not sit down, but began pacing up and down the room.
But he went back and now has lost more than he had won.'
She came back to her bed, put out the candle, lay down, and remained quiet.
She looked at him smilingly, but suddenly her eyebrows twitched, she raised her head, and coming quickly to him she took hold of his hand and clinging close she enveloped him in her hot breath.
She moved away from him and rang.
Levin deliberately took out a ten-rouble note, and speaking slowly but without losing time, handed him the note and explained that Dr Peter Dmitrich (how great and important this Peter Dmitrich, formerly so insignificant, now appeared to Levin!) had promised to come at any time, and that he would certainly not be angry and must therefore be called at once.
He saw Dolly, he saw the doctor smoking thick cigarettes, and Mary Vlasevna with a firm, resolute, and tranquillizing look on her face, and the old Prince pacing up and down the ballroom and frowning.
And every time when the screams that came from the bedroom roused him from momentary forgetfulness he succumbed to the same strange error that had possessed him in the first moments: every time, on hearing the scream, he jumped up and ran to justify himself, but recollected on the way that he was not to blame and that he longed to protect and help her.
'It's all right, it's all right! All goes well!'
With her arms helplessly outstretched upon the quilt, unusually beautiful and calm she lay, gazing silently at him, trying unsuccessfully to smile.
'Evidently I have been asleep and have been forgotten!' thought Oblonsky. And he began pricking up his ears and looking around, and by the end of the winter he had discovered a very good post and begun an attack on it, first from Moscow through aunts, uncles, and friends; and then in spring, when the matter had ripened, he himself went to Petersburg.
She knows that and does not ask you for anything. She says plainly that she dare not ask anything.
But as you had promised, she wrote to you and moved to Moscow.
Karenin gave him his hand, reflected, and then said:
But now Oblonsky saw that it was useless even to think of that; he was, however, glad to see his nephew.
'No, I don't!' hurriedly replied Serezha, and blushing scarlet he hung down his head.
If I do remember, or if I don't... what business is it of his?
Oblonsky did not tell him that it was a 'live' business. Bartnyansky would not have understood that.
'Ah, a voice!' Oblonsky remarked, feeling that he must be as careful as possible in this company, where something peculiar occurred, or was supposed to occur, to which he as yet lacked a clue.
After a momentary pause the Countess Lydia Ivanovna, as if coming to the important point, turned with a subtle smile to Oblonsky.
I did not wish to disturb you,' said Lydia, looking tenderly at him. 'Sit down beside us.'
'Only one must not shut one's eyes, so as to deprive oneself of light,' Karenin continued.
'I want to read Safe and Happy, or, Under the Wing,' she said with a questioning look at Karenin. And having found the book and sat down again, she opened it.
Hush!' she said to the footman, who came in again. 'I am not receiving.'
He was so drunk that he could not get up the stairs, but on seeing Oblonsky he ordered the men to put him on his feet and, clinging to Stephen, he went with him to his room, began relating how he had spent the evening, and fell asleep there.
It was an inner irritation, caused on her side by a diminution of his love for her, and on his by regret that for her sake he had placed himself in a distressing situation, which she, instead of trying to alleviate, made still harder.
She flushed and moved away from him.
'Stop! St-o-op!' said Vronsky, his brow still knit, but holding her back by the hand.
He came up to her, and taking her hand said softly:
His face now wore a tender expression, and she thought she detected in his voice the sound of tears, and their moisture on her hand.
Vronsky called back the valet and told him to bring the telegram.
After a few sips she glanced at him, and from the expression of his face clearly realized that her hand, her movement, and the sound made by her lips were repulsive to him.
The carriage rolled away; he ran rapidly upstairs again.
He glanced at her, frowned for an instant, and continued to read a letter.
'A quarter of an hour there, a quarter of an hour back; he is already on the way, he will be here in a minute.' She looked at her watch.
Just as she was going to compare her watch with the large clock some one drove up.
Such things will happen.
'We also had a telegram from him,' replied Anna, looking round for Kitty.
But it is not for her, who was in love with Vronsky – it is not for her to let me feel it, even if it is true!
I, on the contrary, am hopeful,' said Dolly, looking at Anna with curiosity.
She had never seen her in such a strange and irritable mood. 'When are you leaving?' she asked.
Yes, you are changed!' said Anna.
'Yes, but to-day there is something peculiar about her,' said Dolly. 'When I was seeing her out, there in the ante-room, I thought she was going to cry.'
Peter jumped up on the box, and with his arm akimbo told the coachman to drive to the station.
If, without loving me, he is kind and tender to me from a sense of duty, but what I desire is lacking – that would be a thousand times worse than anger! It would be hell!
Yet I lived without him and exchanged his love for another's, and did not complain of the change as long as the other love satisfied me.' And she thought with disgust of what she called 'the other love.'
A misshapen lady with a bustle (Anna mentally stripped that woman and was horrified at her deformity) and a girl, laughing affectedly, ran past outside.
In order not to see anyone, she rose quickly and sat down by the opposite window of the empty compartment.
She opened it, and her heart sank even before she read it.
Koznyshev had calculated exactly the time necessary for a review to be written; but a month passed, and another, and the silence continued.
Noticing a lady with a collecting-box he beckoned to her and put in a five-rouble note.
His face, which was aged and full of suffering, seemed petrified.
'Well, everybody is going.
'It is not for us to judge, Countess,' Koznyshev remarked with a sigh, 'but I understand how distressing it was for you.'
IN THE SLANTING SHADOW of a pile of sacks heaped up on the platform, Vronsky, in a long overcoat, his hat pulled down low and his hands in his pockets, was walking up and down like an animal in a cage, turning sharply every twenty paces.
'Yes, yes! Hush!...' was all Kitty answered as she sat softly rocking herself and tenderly pressing the little plump arm, which looked as if a thread had been tied round the wrist, and was still feebly waving while Mitya kept shutting and opening his eyes.
At last the arm ceased waving and the eyes closed.
He thought this, and at the same time looked at his watch to calculate how much they could thresh in an hour.
That fellow will press hard, but he'll get his own!
He'll lend, and sometimes let a man off, and so run short himself.
He was breathless with excitement and, incapable of going further, he turned from the road into the wood and sat down on the uncut grass in the shade of the aspens.
LEVIN LOOKED STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM, and saw the herd of cattle and then his trap and his horse Raven and the coachman who, having driven up to the cattle, was speaking to the herdsman; after that, close by, he heard the sound of wheels and the snorting of a well-fed horse; but he was so engrossed in his thoughts that he did not wonder why the coachman was coming for him.
Now we'll have some talks, and we'll see!
At the very entrance a bee became entangled in his beard and began buzzing, but he carefully liberated it.
On the other side of the fence an old man was making a hoop and did not notice Levin, who stopped in the middle of the apiary without calling him.
'Personal opinions don't count in this matter;' said Koznyshev. 'It is not an affair of personal opinions, when all Russia – the people – has expressed its will.'
The people understood nothing, but they sighed as they always do during a sermon,' continued the Prince. 'They were told that there would be a collection in the church for a soul-saving object, so they each took out a kopek and gave it, but what it was for – they did not know!'
I don't publish a newspaper and don't want to defend them, but I am speaking of the unanimity of the intelligent world,' said Koznyshev, turning to his brother. Levin was going to reply, but the old Prince interrupted him.
'I would make only one stipulation,' continued the Prince. 'Alphonse Karr put it very well, before the war with Prussia.
The men, holding their hats, went on with long strides.
'I am very glad, for I was beginning to be grieved about it.
By the light of that flash she saw the whole of his face and, noticing that he was calm and happy, she smiled at him.
A bit of a scare shot through Tom--a touch of uncomfortable suspicion.
"'Tisn't any of your business, maybe."
Better look out who you're fooling with next time."
So he went away; but he said he "'lowed" to "lay" for that boy.
He put down his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing interest while the bandage was being unwound.
In another moment he was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.
But Tom's energy did not last.
So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys.
Tom's mouth watered for the apple, but he stuck to his work.
These two great commanders did not condescend to fight in person--that being better suited to the still smaller fry--but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through aides-de-camp.
At last he rose up sighing and departed in the darkness.
The strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort.
True, the knife would not cut anything, but it was a "sure-enough" Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur in that--though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so, perhaps.
Mary was soon ready, and the three children set out for Sunday-school--a place that Tom hated with his whole heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.
Ten blue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy times) to the pupil.
And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded a Bible.
The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:
Tom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish.
It was a great many years ago, and I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in some foreign country.
The minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in a peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country.
The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he only endured it--if he even did that much.
The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod--and yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly worth the saving.
He surveyed the prize; walked around it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy the diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws, and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent and absent-minded.
So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again.
Tom lay thinking.
So he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further.
and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody.
"Why, you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard 'long about midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and when it's midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can't see 'em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear 'em talk; and when they're taking that feller away, you heave your cat after 'em and say, 'Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I'm done with ye!'
Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it.
Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.
He hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business-like alacrity.
Take off your jacket."
She thrust it away again, but with less animosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place.
The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees.
This change of base occurred often.
"I won't!"
I'll go the other way and come it over 'em the same way."
Presently Becky began to suspect.
It did not occur to him that he had tried it several times before, himself, but could never find the hiding-places afterward.
He laid himself down and put his mouth close to this depression and called--
He well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he gave up discouraged.
Now he went back to his treasure-house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing when he tossed the marble away; then he took another marble from his pocket and tossed it in the same way, saying: "Brother, go find your brother!"
They took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground, struck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful combat, "two up and two down."
Why don't you fall?"
The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss.
The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed.
They cast down their load and began to open the grave.
They pried off the lid with their shovels, got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground.
"That's the talk!" said Injun Joe.
He reeled and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him with his blood, and in the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the two frightened boys went speeding away in the dark.
Then he sat up, pushing the body from him, and gazed at it, and then around him, confusedly.
"Consound it, Tom Sawyer, you're just old pie, 'long-side o' what I am.
Besides, I reckon he ain't ever coming back to this town any more."
"Hucky, do you das't to go if I lead?"
Then they separated, cogitating.
He unrolled it.
When he stood before the murdered man, he shook as with a palsy, and he put his face in his hands and burst into tears.
What did you want to come here for?" somebody said.
He was sick, he said, and he looked it.
When Jeff arrived, Tom accosted him; and "led up" warily to opportunities for remark about Becky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait.
He had finished gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with tobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of fragrant smoke--he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment. The other pirates envied him this majestic vice, and secretly resolved to acquire it shortly.
They caught fish, cooked supper and ate it, and then fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them; and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were gratifying to look upon--from their point of view.
However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along till he found a low place and drew himself out.
Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing cautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might squeeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began, warily.
No end of strange things now.
He warn't any more responsible than a colt. _He_ never meant any harm, and he was the best-hearted boy that ever was"--and she began to cry.
He had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and turning over.
He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the candle.
But something occurred to him, and he lingered considering.
He threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large there, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was tenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned in and slept like a graven image.
After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until they were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal water of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun.
And now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each other's faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing, sputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.
He erased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving the other boys together and joining them.
Now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff, charily, and with slender confidence.
"Well, I have too," said Tom; "oh, hundreds of times.
And when we tell 'em we learned when we was off pirating, won't they wish they'd been along?"
You go over that way and I'll hunt around by the spring. No, you needn't come, Huck--we can find it."
So Huck sat down again, and waited an hour.
And now a drenching rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the ground.
Suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: "Praise God from whom all blessings flow--_sing_!--and put your hearts in it!"
"And it seems to me that you said, 'Why, I believe that that door--'"
"I don't think I said anything," said Sid.
They began to tell their adventures to hungry listeners--but they only began; it was not a thing likely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish material.
I don't care for them!" and burst into tears, and got up and walked away.
Then Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse.
Twice she put out her hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained.
The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face: "I'll thank you to keep yourself _to_ yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer.
She hurled one in return, and the angry breach was complete.
Only the biggest boys, and young ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing.
At last they conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory.
He was looking tolerably mellow.
But after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior, all is vanity, the flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates harshly upon her ear; the ballroom has lost its charms; and with wasted health and imbittered heart, she turns away with the conviction that earthly pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!"
He knew what the matter was, and set himself to right it.
He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only distorted them more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced.
He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly increased.
That broke up the meeting.
Fourth of July was coming; but he soon gave that up--gave it up before he had worn his shackles over forty-eight hours--and fixed his hopes upon old Judge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral, since he was so high an official.
After a long wait the jury filed in and took their places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and hopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all the curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe, stolid as ever.
The boy looked wild enough, for he was badly scared.
Tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him confidentially.
Tom considered awhile; and then said: "The ha'nted house.
And if he hit that dime only on the edge he would set down and cry--and curse.
They presently entered, softly, with quickened pulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound, and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.
They nudged each other every moment--eloquent nudges and easily understood, for they simply meant--"Oh, but ain't you glad _now_ we're here!"
He reached his hand in and drew it out--
"I know it," said Injun Joe; "and this looks like it, I should say."
What business with fresh earth on them?
If his notions of hidden treasure had been analyzed, they would have been found to consist of a handful of real dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars.
Also Wednesday. But Thursday night promised better.
I hopped in, and shook off the towel, and, _Great Caesar's Ghost!_"
Morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o'clock a giddy and rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher's, and everything was ready for a start.
But they never stopped at the quarry.
Better give it up."
Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue--a thing still more awful than any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped gingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing, one-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one side and then on the other. He took another step back, with the same elaboration and the same risks; then another and another, and--a twig snapped under his foot!
His breath stopped and he listened.
Huck accompanied them no further.
Huck waited for no particulars.
Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall sons speedily dressed themselves.
During breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man said that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going to bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for marks of blood.
Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the main matter--but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his visitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he refused to part with his secret.
When all else had been learned, the widow said: "I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that noise.
They've just come back."
Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the village, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching.
Mrs. Thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it.
"Hush, hush, child, hush! I've told you before, you must _not_ talk.
Under the roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together, thousands in a bunch; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by hundreds, squeaking and darting furiously at the candles.
By-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was grown to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction, was at least progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to invite death and shorten its pursuit.
Both held their breath and listened.
Tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could.
He talked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no sounds came again.
The children groped their way back to the spring.
Tom got about, a little, on Thursday, was downtown Friday, and nearly as whole as ever Saturday; but Becky did not leave her room until Sunday, and then she looked as if she had passed through a wasting illness.
Tom learned of Huck's sickness and went to see him on Friday, but could not be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday.
You got into No. 2 and never found anything but whiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must 'a' ben you, soon as I heard 'bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you hadn't got the money becuz you'd 'a' got at me some way or other and told me even if you was mum to everybody else.
"Less start right off, Tom."
When they were several miles below "Cave Hollow," Tom said: "Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the cave hollow--no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike.
If you drove them out they'd turn right around and come back. It's so in all the books."
They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel, then made their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on.
He disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two small sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started off, dragging his cargo behind him.
Just as they were about to move on, the Welshman stepped out and said:
Mr. Jones said: "Tom wasn't at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and Huck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry."
She took them to a bedchamber and said: "Now wash and dress yourselves.
There--no thanks, as the widow says"--and Tom cuffed Sid's ears and helped him to the door with several kicks. "Now go and tell auntie if you dare--and tomorrow you'll catch it!"
