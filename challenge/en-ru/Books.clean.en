Leo Tolstoy
ALL HAPPY FAMILIES resemble one another , but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way .
Everything was upset in the Oblonskys ' house .
The wife had discovered an intrigue between her husband and their former French governess , and declared that she would not continue to live under the same roof with him .
'Let me see what was it ? ' he thought , trying to recall his dream .
His eyes sparkled merrily and he smiled as he sat thinking .
'Yes , it was very nice .
There were many other delightful things which I can 't just get hold of - can 't catch now I 'm awake . ' 
And then he suddenly remembered that , and why , he was not sleeping there but in his study . The smile vanished from his face and he frowned .
'Oh dear , dear , dear ! ' he groaned recalling what had happened .
And the details of his quarrel with his wife , his inextricable position , and , worst of all , his guilt , rose up in his imagination .
'No , she will never forgive me ; she can 't forgive me !
That 's the tragedy of it ! ' he thought . ' Oh dear , oh dear ! ' he muttered despairingly , as he recalled the most painful details of the quarrel .
She sat there : the careworn , ever @-@ bustling , and ( as he thought ) rather simple Dolly - with the note in her hand and a look of terror , despair , and anger on her face .
'What is this ? This ? ' she asked , pointing to the note .
And , as often happens , it was not so much the memory of the event that tormented him , as of the way he had replied to her .
He could not forgive himself for that silly smile .
Dolly , seeing it , shuddered as if with physical pain , and with her usual vehemence burst into a torrent of cruel words and rushed from the room .
Since then she had refused to see him .
'It 's all the fault of that stupid smile , ' thought Oblonsky . ' 
But what am I to do ? What can I do ? ' he asked himself in despair , and could find no answer .
He was incapable of self @-@ deception and could not persuade himself that he repented of his conduct .
He could not feel repentant that he , a handsome amorous man of thirty @-@ four , was not in love with his wife , the mother of five living and two dead children and only a year younger than himself .
He repented only of not having managed to conceal his conduct from her .
Nevertheless he felt his unhappy position and pitied his wife , his children , and himself .
He might perhaps have been able to hide things from her had he known that the knowledge would so distress her .
He had never clearly considered the matter , but had a vague notion that his wife had long suspected him of being unfaithful and winked at it .
Of course it 's not quite nice that she had been a governess in our house .
( He vividly pictured to himself Mlle Roland 's roguish black eyes , and her smile . )
'Besides , as long as she was in the house I never took any liberties .
Why need it all happen at once ?
What am I to do ? '
He could find no answer , except life 's usual answer to the most complex and insoluble questions .
That answer is : live in the needs of the day , that is , find forgetfulness .
He could no longer find forgetfulness in sleep , at any rate not before night , could not go back to the music and the songs of the little decanter @-@ women , consequently he must seek forgetfulness in the dream of life .
The bell was answered immediately by his old friend and valet , Matthew , who brought in his clothes , boots , and a telegram .
He was followed by the barber with shaving tackle .
'Any papers from the Office ? ' asked Oblonsky , as he took the telegram and sat down before the looking @-@ glass .
'They 're on your table , ' answered Matthew with a questioning and sympathizing glance at his master - adding after a pause with a sly smile : ' Some one has called from the jobmaster 's . ' 
Oblonsky did not answer , but glanced at Matthew 's face in the looking @-@ glass . From their looks , as they met in the glass , it was evident that they understood one another .
Oblonsky 's look seemed to say : ' Why do you tell me that ? As if you don 't know ! '
Matthew put his hands into the pocket of his jacket , put out his foot , and looked at his master with a slight , good @-@ humoured smile .
'I ordered him to come the Sunday after next , and not to trouble you or himself needlessly till then , ' said he , evidently repeating a sentence he had prepared .
Oblonsky understood that Matthew meant to have a joke and draw attention to himself .
He tore open the telegram and read it , guessing at the words , which ( as so often happens in telegrams ) were misspelt , and his face brightened .
'Matthew , my sister Anna Arkadyevna is coming to @-@ morrow , ' he said , motioning away for a moment the shiny plump hand of the barber , which was shaving a rosy path between his long curly whiskers .
'Is she coming alone , or with Mr. Karenin ? '
Oblonsky could not answer as the barber was busy with his upper lip ; but he raised one finger , and Matthew nodded to him in the glass .
'Darya Alexandrovna ? ' Matthew repeated , as if in doubt .
Give her the telegram , and see what she says . ' 
Oblonsky was washed , his hair brushed , and he was about to dress , when Matthew , stepping slowly in his creaking boots , re @-@ entered the room with the telegram in his hand .
The barber was no longer there .
" He may do as he pleases " - that is , as you please , sir , ' he said , laughing with his eyes only ; and , putting his hands in his pockets , with his head on one side , he gazed at his master .
Oblonsky remained silent , then a kind and rather pathetic smile appeared on his handsome face .
'Ah , Matthew ! ' he said , shaking his head .
'Never mind , sir - things will shape themselves . ' 
'Just so , sir . ' 
'Do you think so ? - Who 's that ? ' asked Oblonsky , hearing the rustle of a woman 's dress outside the door .
'It 's me , sir , ' answered a firm and pleasant woman 's voice , and Matrena Filimonovna , the children 's nurse thrust her stern pockmarked face in at the door .
'What is it , Matrena ? ' asked Oblonsky , stepping out to her .
'What is it ? ' said he mournfully .
'Won 't you go and try again , sir ?
She suffers dreadfully ; it 's pitiful to see her , and everything in the house is topsy @-@ turvy .
You should consider the children !
'But she won 't admit me ! '
'Do your part - God is merciful .
Pray to Him , sir , pray to Him ! '
'All right - now go , ' said Oblonsky , suddenly blushing . ' I must get dressed , ' said he , turning to Matthew , and he resolutely threw off his dressing @-@ gown .
Matthew blew some invisible speck off the shirt which he held ready gathered up like a horse 's collar , and with evident pleasure invested with it his master 's carefully tended body .
This forest had to be sold ; but until he was reconciled with his wife the sale was quite out of the question .
What was most unpleasant was that a financial consideration would now be mixed up with the impending reconciliation .
The idea that he might be biased by that consideration , might seek a reconciliation in order to sell the forest , offended him .
Oblonsky subscribed to and read a Liberal paper - not an extreme Liberal paper but one that expressed the opinions of the majority .
The Liberal Party maintained that everything in Russia was bad , and it was a fact that Oblonsky had many debts and decidedly too little money .
The Liberal Party said that marriage was an obsolete institution which ought to be reformed ; and family life really gave Oblonsky very little pleasure , forcing him to tell lies and dissemble , which was quite contrary to his nature .
Thus Liberalism became habitual to Oblonsky , and he loved his paper as he loved his after @-@ dinner cigar , for the slight mistiness it produced in his brain .
He also read the finance article in which Bentham and Mill were mentioned and hits were made at the Ministry .
But that joyful smile at once brought everything back to his mind , and he grew thoughtful .
Then he heard the sound of two childish voices outside the door , and recognized them as the voices of his eldest daughter , Tanya , and of his little boy Grisha .
'I told you not to put passengers on the roof , ' the girl shouted in English . ' Now pick them up ! '
'Everything is disorganized , ' thought Oblonsky ; ' here are the children running wild - ' and going to the door he called them in .
The girl , her father 's pet , ran boldly in , embraced him , and hung laughing on his neck , pleased , as she always was , to smell the familiar scent of his whiskers .
Having kissed his face , flushed by stooping and lit up by tenderness , the girl unclasped her hands and was going to run away , but he held her back .
'How 's Mama ? ' he asked , passing his hand over his daughter 's smooth delicate little neck , as he smilingly said ' Good morning ' in answer to the little boy 's greeting .
He was conscious of not caring as much for the boy as for the girl but did his best to treat them both alike . The boy felt this and did not respond to his father 's cold smile .
'That means that she has again not slept all night , ' he thought .
He noticed this and blushed too .
'I don 't know , ' she said . ' She said we were not to have any lessons , but must walk with Miss Hull to Grandmamma 's . ' 
'Well you may go , my little Tanyakin ...
Oh , wait ! ' he said , still holding her and stroking her delicate little hand .
'For Grisha ? ' she asked , holding out the chocolate .
'Yes , yes , ' and stroking her shoulder he kissed her hair at the roots and her neck , and let her go .
'The carriage is ready , ' said Matthew , ' and there is a woman on business waiting for you . ' 
'But I must give you time to finish your coffee , ' answered Matthew in his friendly rude tone , with which it was impossible to be angry .
'Well , ask her in at once , ' said Oblonsky , his face wrinkling with vexation .
Having dismissed her , he took his hat and paused to consider whether he had forgotten anything .
He found he had forgotten nothing but what he wanted to forget : his wife .
His head dropped , and his handsome face became worried .
Nothing except hypocrisy and falsehood could now result - and these were repugnant to his nature .
'Nevertheless it will have to be done sooner or later . After all , things can 't remain as they are , ' he said , trying to brace himself .
He expanded his chest , took out a cigarette , lit it , took two whiffs , then threw it into a pearl @-@ shell ash @-@ tray , and crossing the drawing @-@ room with rapid steps , he opened the door which led into his wife 's bedroom .
Hearing her husband 's step she stopped and looked at the door , vainly trying to assume a severe and contemptuous expression .
She felt that she was afraid of him and afraid of the impending interview .
She pressed her lips together and a cheek @-@ muscle twitched on the right side of her pale nervous face .
'What do you want ? ' she said quickly in a voice unlike her usual deep tones .
'Dolly , ' he repeated unsteadily , ' Anna is coming to @-@ day . ' 
'Go away , go away , go away ! ' she cried , as if in physical pain , without looking at him .
You know ... ' He could not continue . His throat was choked with sobs .
'Dolly , what can I say ? ...
Think , nine years ... Can 't they atone for a momentary - a momentary ... '
Her eyes drooped and she waited to hear what he would say , as if entreating him to persuade her somehow that she had made a mistake .
'Go away - go away from here ! ' she cried in a still shriller voice , ' and don 't talk to me of your infatuations and all those horrors ! '
She wished to go away , but staggered and held on to the back of a chair to support herself .
His face broadened , his lips swelled , and his eyes filled with tears .
'Dolly ! ' he said , now actually sobbing , ' for heaven 's sake think of the children - they have done nothing !
I am the guilty one .
I have no words to express my guilt ...
She sat down and he could hear her loud , heavy breathing . He felt unutterably sorry for her .
She tried again and again to speak and could not .
But she had spoken of ' our children , ' and looking gratefully at her he moved to take her hand ; but she stepped aside with a look of repugnance .
Tell me , do you think it possible for us to live together after what has happened ?
Is it possible ?
Say , is it possible ? ' she repeated , raising her voice . ' When my husband , the father of my children , has love affairs with his children 's governess ? '
'But what 's to be done ? - what 's to be done ? ' said he , in a piteous voice , hardly knowing what he was saying , and sinking his head lower and lower .
'You are horrid and disgusting to me ! ' she shouted , getting more and more excited . ' Your tears are - water !
To me you are detestable , disgusting - a stranger , yes , a perfect stranger ! ' She uttered that word stranger , so terrible to herself , with anguish and hatred .
He did not understand that his pity exasperated her .
She saw in him pity for herself but not love .
'It is awful , awful ! ' he muttered .
At that moment a child began to cry in another room , probably having tumbled down . Darya Alexandrovna listened , and her face softened suddenly .
She seemed to be trying to recollect herself , as if she did not know where she was or what she had to do . Then she rose quickly and moved toward the door .
'After all , she loves my child , ' he thought , noticing the change in her face when the baby cried ; ' my child - then how can she hate me ? '
'Dolly , just a word ! ' he said , following her .
'If you follow me , I shall call the servants and the children !
I 'll let everybody know you are a scoundrel !
I am going away to @-@ day , and you may live here with your mistress ! '
She went out , slamming the door .
Oblonsky sighed , wiped his face , and with soft steps left the room .
'Matthew says " things will shape themselves , " - but how ?
And her shouting - it was so vulgar , ' he thought , recalling her screams and the words scoundrel and mistress . ' And the maids may have heard it !
It is dreadfully banal , dreadfully ! '
For a few seconds Oblonsky stood alone ; then he wiped his eyes , sighed , and expanding his chest went out of the room .
That 's a good phrase , ' he thought . ' I must use that . ' 
'Matthew ! ' he called , ' will you and Mary arrange everything for Anna Arkadyevna in the little sitting @-@ room ? ' he added when Matthew appeared .
'I 'll see ...
'Enough or not , we shall have to manage , that 's clear , ' said Matthew , closing the carriage door and stepping back into the porch .
'Is it possible that he still sees her ?
Why didn 't I ask him ?
Oh , no ! It 's impossible to be reunited ...
How I loved - and don 't I love him now ?
Don 't I love him more than ever ?
The most terrible thing ... ' She did not finish the thought , because Matrena Filimonovna thrust her head in at the door .
'All right ! I 'll come and see about it in a moment ...
and Darya Alexandrovna plunged into her daily cares , and for a time drowned her grief in them .
Here he is ! ' said almost every one he met , smilingly .
It was the third year that Oblonsky had been Head of that Government Board in Moscow , and he had won not only the affection but also the respect of his fellow @-@ officials , subordinates , chiefs , and all who had anything to do with him .
Having arrived at his destination , Oblonsky ; respectfully followed by the door @-@ keeper bearing his portfolio , entered his little private room , put on his uniform , and came out into the Office .
The clerks and attendants all rose and bowed cheerfully and respectfully .
Oblonsky walked quickly , as was his wont , to his place , shook hands with the Members , and sat down .
He chatted and joked just as much as was proper and then turned to business .
No one could determine better than he the limits of freedom , simplicity , and formality , necessary for the pleasant transaction of business .
The Secretary came up with the papers , cheerfully and respectfully like everybody in Oblonsky 's Office , and remarked in the familiarly Liberal tone introduced by Oblonsky :
'Got it at last ? ' said Oblonsky , holding this paper down with his finger . ' Well , gentlemen ... ' and the sitting commenced .
Till two o 'clock the business was to continue uninterruptedly , but at two there was to be an adjournment for lunch .
It was not quite two when the large glass doors suddenly swung open and some one came in .
When the Report had been read , Oblonsky rose , stretching himself , and , paying tribute to the Liberalism of the times , took out a cigarette before leaving the Office to go to his private room .
'We shall have time to finish after lunch , ' said Oblonsky .
'Plenty of time ' said Nikitin .
'He must be a precious rogue , that Fomin , ' said Grinevich , referring to one of those concerned in the case under consideration .
Oblonsky made a face at these words , thereby indicating that it is not right to form an opinion prematurely , and did not reply .
'Who was it came in ? ' he asked the door @-@ keeper .
'Some man came in without permission , your Excellency , when I wasn 't looking .
'Perhaps he has gone out into the hall ; he was walking about there just now .
His kindly face , beaming over the gold @-@ embroidered collar of his uniform , grew still more radiant when he recognized the man who was coming up .
'Yes , it 's he !
'I 've only just arrived , and am very anxious to see you , ' answered Levin , looking round with constraint , and yet crossly and uneasily .
'Well then , come into my room , ' said Oblonsky , who knew his friend 's self @-@ conscious and irritable shyness ; and seizing him by the arm he led him along as if past some danger .
Levin and Oblonsky were almost of the same age ; and with Levin , Oblonsky was on familiar terms not through champagne only .
Levin had been his comrade and friend in early youth , and they were fond of one another as friends who have come together in early youth often are , in spite of the difference in their characters and tastes .
Yet , as often happens between men who have chosen different pursuits , each , while in argument justifying the other 's activity , despised it in the depth of his heart .
Each thought that his own way of living was real life , and that the life of his friend was - illusion .
Oblonsky could not repress a slightly sarcastic smile at the sight of Levin .
How many times he had already seen him arriving in Moscow from the country , where he did something , though what it was Oblonsky could never quite understand or feel any interest in .
Levin came to Moscow always excited , always in a hurry , rather shy and irritated by his own shyness , and usually with totally new and unexpected views about things .
Oblonsky laughed at all this , and yet liked it .
Similarly , Levin in his heart despised the town life his friend was leading , and his official duties which he considered futile and ridiculed .
But the difference was that Oblonsky , doing as every one else did , laughed with confidence and good humour , while Levin laughed uncertainly and sometimes angrily .
Oblonsky at once noticed Levin 's look and smiled .
'Very pleased ... ' said the old official ..
'I have the honour of knowing your brother , Sergius Ivanich , ' said Grinevich , holding out his narrow hand with the long fingernails .
Levin frowned , shook hands coldly , and immediately turned to Oblonsky .
'No , I am no longer on the Zemstvo - I have quarrelled with the lot of them , and don 't attend their meetings any more , ' said he , addressing his friend .
'Quick work ! ' said Oblonsky , with a smile . ' What was it all about ? '
I see you 've reached another new phase - a Conservative one this time ! ' said Oblonsky . ' However , we 'll talk about that later . ' 
But I want to see you , ' said Levin , gazing with aversion at Grinevich 's hand .
Oblonsky 's smile was hardly perceptible .
It was so strange to see that intelligent manly face in such a childish condition that Oblonsky left off looking at him .
'Where shall we see one another ?
You know it is very , very important for me to have a talk with you , ' said Levin .
'Well - suppose we go to lunch at Gurin 's and have a talk there ?
'No , ' said Levin , after a moment 's consideration ; ' I have to go somewhere else . ' 
'Well then , let 's dine together . ' 
'Dine ?
'Well , tell me the word or two now , and we 'll talk at dinner . ' 
'The two words are ... however , it 's nothing particular , ' said Levin , and his face became almost vicious in his efforts to overcome his shyness .
'What are the Shcherbatskys doing ?
Oblonsky , who had long known that Levin was in love with his , Oblonsky 's , sister @-@ in @-@ law Kitty , smiled very slightly and his eyes sparkled merrily .
'You spoke of two words , but I can 't answer in two because ...
Levin , who during Oblonsky 's talk with the Secretary had quite overcome his shyness , stood leaning both arms on the back of a chair and listening with ironical attention .
'I don 't understand it at all ! ' he remarked .
'What don 't you understand ? ' asked Oblonsky with his usual merry smile , as he took out a cigarette .
He expected Levin to say something eccentric .
'I don 't understand what you 're doing , ' said Levin shrugging his shoulders . ' How can you do it seriously ? '
'Why not ? '
'Because there 's nothing to do ! '
'Perhaps ! ' said Levin . ' But all the same I admire your dignity and am proud that my friend is such a great man !
But all the same you 've not answered my question , ' he added , making a desperate effort to look Oblonsky straight in the face .
It 's all very well for you , who have three thousand desyatins in the Karazin District , and such muscles , and are as fresh as a twelve @-@ year @-@ old girl ! But still , you 'll be joining us yourself some day ! ...
Now , about what you were asking : nothing has changed , but it 's a pity you 've stopped away so long . ' 
'Oh , nothing - ' answered Oblonsky . ' We 'll talk it over later on .
But what has brought you here specially ? '
'We 'll talk about that too later on , ' said Levin and again blushed to his very ears .
'All right , that 's natural enough ! ' said Oblonsky . ' Well , you know , I 'd ask you to come to us , but my wife is not very well .
Let 's see , - if you want to meet them , you 'll be sure to find them in the Zoological Gardens from four to five .
Go there , and I 'll call for you and we 'll dine somewhere together . ' 
'Mind you don 't forget ! I know you - you may rush off back to the country ! ' shouted Oblonsky after him .
'That 'll be all right ! ' said Levin and left the room , only recollecting when already at the door that he had not taken leave of Oblonsky 's colleagues .
'He seems a very energetic man , ' said Grinevich when Levin was gone .
'Yes , my dear fellow , ' said Oblonsky , shaking his head , ' and he 's a lucky man !
Three thousand desyatins in the Karazin District , his life before him , and such freshness !
'What have you to complain of , Stephen Arkadyevich ? '
'Oh , things are wretched , miserable ! ' said Oblonsky , and sighed heavily .
The Levins and the Shcherbatskys were two old aristocratic Moscow families that had always been on intimate and friendly terms .
Their ties were drawn still closer during Levin 's University days .
He had prepared for and entered the University together with young Prince Shcherbatsky , Dolly 's and Kitty 's brother .
At that time Levin often visited the Shcherbatskys , and fell in love with the family .
Strange as it may seem , it was the whole Shcherbatsky family - especially the feminine half of it - that Levin was in love with .
In his student days he very nearly fell in love with the eldest daughter , Dolly ; but a marriage was soon after arranged between her and Oblonsky .
He seemed to feel that he must fall in love with one of the sisters , but he was not sure with which .
But Nataly too , as soon as she came out , married the diplomat , Lvov .
Kitty was still a child when Levin finished at the University .
Young Shcherbatsky who entered the navy was drowned in the Baltic ; and after that , in spite of his friendship with Oblonsky , Levin 's intercourse with the Shcherbatskys became less frequent .
But when he had come to Moscow early in the winter of this year and met them , he knew at last which of the three sisters he was really fated to love .
Levin 's conviction that it was impossible rested on the idea that from her relatives ' point of view he was not a good or suitable match for the delightful Kitty , and that Kitty herself could not love him .
Of course the mysterious , enchanting Kitty could not love a plain fellow , such as he considered himself to be , a man so ordinary and undistinguished .
Moreover , his former relation to Kitty had been that of a grown @-@ up man towards a child whose brother 's friend he was , and this seemed an additional obstacle in love 's path .
He had heard that women often love plain ordinary men but he did not believe it , because he judged by himself and he could only love beautiful mysterious exceptional women .
So he had now come to Moscow determined to propose to her , and to marry her if he was accepted .
Or ... but he dared not think what would happen if she refused him .
But his brother was not alone . A well @-@ known professor of philosophy was with him , who had come specially from Kharkov to settle a dispute that had arisen between them on an important philosophical question .
The question was the fashionable one , whether a definite line exists between psychological and physiological phenomena in human activity ; and if so , where it lies ?
When Levin entered , Sergius Ivanich greeted him with the coldly affable smile he bestowed on everybody and , having introduced him to the professor , went on with the discussion .
The small spectacled man with the narrow forehead interrupted the conversation a moment to say , ' how do you do ' to Levin and , paying no further attention to him , went on talking .
Levin sat down to wait till the professor should go , but soon became interested in the subject of their conversation .
The most fundamental perception - that of existence - is not received through the senses , for there is no special organ to convey that perception . ' 
'Yes , but they ( Wurst and Knaust and Pripasov ) will tell you that your conception of existence results from the collective effect of all your sensations and is therefore a result of sensations .
Wurst actually says that without the senses there can be no perception of existence . ' 
'I would maintain the opposite ... ' began Koznyshev .
But here again it seemed to Levin that having reached the most important matter they avoided it ; and he made up his mind to ask the professor a question .
'Consequently , if my senses are destroyed , if my body dies , no further existence is possible ? ' he asked .
'That question we have as yet no right to decide ... '
Levin listened no longer but sat waiting for the professor to go .
WHEN THE PROFESSOR HAD GONE , Koznyshev turned to his step @-@ brother .
'I am very glad you have come .
Levin knew that farming did not interest his elder brother and that the question was merely a concession , therefore he replied generally as to the sale of wheat and money matters .
He felt that his brother would not look at the matter as he wished him to .
'Well , and how is your Zemstvo getting on ? ' asked Koznyshev , who took a keen interest in the rural administration and attached great importance to it .
'No , I am no longer on it . I resigned , ' answered Levin , ' and don 't attend the Meetings any more . ' 
'That 's a pity ! ' said Koznyshev , and frowned .
To justify himself Levin began to relate what used to happen at the Meetings in his district .
'We Russians are always like that . It may be a good trait in us - this capacity to see our own faults - but we overdo it , and comfort ourselves with sarcasm , which is always ready on our tongues .
I can only tell you , that with such rights as we have in our rural institutions , any other European nation - the English or the Germans - would have secured their freedom , while we only jeer at our Zemstvos ! '
'But what is to be done ? ' said Levin guiltily . ' That was my last attempt .
And I tried with my whole soul .
'Incapable ! ' said Koznyshev . ' No , you don 't look at it from the right point of view . ' 
'That may be , ' said Levin mournfully .
'Do you know that our brother Nicholas is here again ? '
'You don 't mean to say so ! ' cried Levin , horror @-@ struck .
'How do you know ? '
'Prokofy met him in the street . ' 
'Here , in Moscow ?
Do you know ? ' Levin rose from his chair as if meaning to go at once .
Koznyshev took a note from under a paper @-@ weight and handed it to his brother .
Levin read the note , written in a curious but familiar hand : ' I humbly beg you to leave me alone .
That is all I demand of my dear brothers . - NICHOLAS LEVIN . ' 
When Levin had read the note , holding it in his hand , he remained standing in front of Koznyshev without lifting his head .
A struggle was going on within him between the desire to forget his unfortunate brother for the present , and the consciousness that this would be wrong .
'He evidently wants to offend me , ' continued Koznyshev , ' but he cannot do that . I wish with all my heart I could help him , but I know it can 't be done . ' 
'Yes , yes , ' said Levin , ' I understand , and appreciate your attitude toward him ; but personally I shall go to see him . ' 
'It may be impossible to help him , but I feel - especially at this moment ... but that 's a different matter - I feel that I cannot be at peace ... '
'Well , I don 't understand that , ' said Koznyshev . ' But what I do understand is a lesson in humility .
I have begun to look differently , more leniently , at what is called rascality , since brother Nicholas became what he is .
Do you know what he has done ? '
'Ah , it 's dreadful , dreadful ! ' Levin repeated .
Having got the address from Koznyshev 's footman Levin thought of going at once to see his brother ; but , on reflection , decided to put off the visit till the evening .
To obtain peace of mind it was necessary first of all to decide the business that had brought him to Moscow .
He therefore went to Oblonsky 's office , and having received news of the Shcherbatskys he drove to the place where he was told he could see Kitty .
He walked along the path leading to the skating lake , and kept repeating to himself ' I must not be excited .
I must be quiet ! ...
What 's the matter ? Be quiet , stupid ! ' he said to his heart .
But the more he tried to be calm , the more laboured grew his breath .
He met an acquaintance who called to him , but Levin did not even notice who it was .
A few more steps brought him to the skating lake , and among all the skaters he at once recognized her .
She stood talking to a lady at the other end of the lake .
There seemed to be nothing striking in her dress or attitude , but it was as easy for Levin to recognize her in that crowd as to find a rose among nettles .
She was the smile that brightened everything around .
'Can I really step down on to the ice , and go up to her ? ' he thought .
The spot where she stood seemed to him an unapproachable sanctuary , and there was a moment when he nearly went away , he was so filled with awe .
He had to make an effort and reason with himself that all sorts of people were passing near her and he himself might have come just to skate .
He stepped down , avoiding any long look at her as one avoids long looks at the sun , but seeing her as one sees the sun , without looking .
On that day of the week and at that hour , people belonging to the same set and acquainted with one another , met on the ice .
Yet skaters appeared quite calmly to gain on her , to catch her up , and even speak to her , and quite independently of her to amuse themselves enjoying the excellent ice and the fine weather .
Nicholas Shcherbatsky , Kitty 's cousin , in a short jacket , tight trousers , with skates on his feet , was sitting on a bench , and seeing Levin , called out to him .
'I haven 't any skates , ' answered Levin , wondering at such boldness and freedom of manner in her presence and not losing sight of her for a moment although not looking at her .
He felt the sun approaching him .
She was not very firm on her feet . Having drawn her hands from the muff that hung by a cord from her neck , she held them out and looking at Levin , whom she had recognized , she smiled at him and at her fears .
Having turned the corner , she pushed off with an elastic little foot , glided straight up to Shcherbatsky , and catching hold of him with her hand , nodded smilingly to Levin .
She was more beautiful than he had imagined her .
'Have you been here long ? ' she said , shaking hands with him . ' Thank you , ' she added as he picked up the handkerchief she had dropped from her muff .
She looked attentively at him as if wishing to understand his confusion .
There is a tradition here that you are the best skater , ' she said , flicking off with a small black @-@ gloved hand some hoar @-@ frost crystals that had fallen on her muff .
'Yes , I used to be passionately fond of skating . I wanted to be perfect at it . ' 
'You seem to do everything passionately , ' she remarked with a smile . ' I should so like to see you skate .
Put on a pair and let us skate together . ' 
'Skate together !
Can it be possible ? ' thought Levin looking at her .
'I 'll go and put them on at once , ' he said , and went to hire some skates .
Is that right ? ' he added , pulling the strap tight .
'Yes , that 's right , that 's right ! Please be quick ! ' answered Levin , trying to restrain the happy smile which appeared on his face .
'Yes , ' he thought , ' this is life - this is joy !
She said , " Together : let us skate together " !
Shall I tell her now ?
Away with this weakness ! '
He approached Kitty timidly , but her smile again tranquillized him .
She gave him her hand and they went on together , increasing their speed , and the faster they went the closer she pressed his hands .
'I should learn quicker with you , for some reason - feel confidence in you , ' she said .
'And I am confident of myself when you lean on me , ' he answered , and was immediately frightened of what he had said , and blushed .
But I have no right to ask , ' he said hurriedly .
'Go to her then , she is so fond of you . ' 
'What does she mean ?
I have hurt her .
Help me , O Lord ! ' thought Levin , hastening toward the old Frenchwoman with the grey curls ; who sat on one of the benches .
She welcomed Levin as an old friend , showing her set of false teeth in a smile .
'Yes , you see we grow up , ' she said , indicating Kitty with a glance , ' and grow old .
He had not the faintest recollection of it , but she was fond of the joke and had laughed at it for the last ten years .
'Well , go - go and skate !
When Levin returned to Kitty her face was no longer stern and her eyes had their former truthful , kindly look but he thought there was an intentionally quiet manner in her affability and he felt sad .
Having spoken about her old governess and her peculiarities , she asked him about his way of life .
'I don 't feel at all dull , I am very busy , ' he answered , conscious that she was subduing him to her quiet tone , from which - as had happened at the beginning of the winter - he would not be able to free himself .
'I don 't know , ' he answered , without thinking of what he was saying .
The idea that if he accepted her tone of calm friendliness he would again go away without having settled anything occurred to him , and he determined to rebel .
It all depends on you , ' he said , and was at once terrified at his own words .
'My God ! What have I done ?
O Lord , help me and teach me ! ' prayed Levin , and feeling at the same time a need of violent exercise , he got up speed and described inner and outer circles .
He then flew down the slope and glided along the ice without so much as changing the easy position of his arms .
'Oh , that 's a new trick ! ' said Levin , and at once ran up to try that new trick .
'Don 't hurt yourself - it needs practice ! ' Nicholas Shcherbatsky called out .
He caught his foot on the last step , but , scarcely touching the ice with his hand , made a violent effort , regained his balance , and skated away laughing .
'Good ! Dear man ! ' thought Kitty who at that moment was just coming out of the little house with Mlle Linon , looking at him with a smile of gentle tenderness as at a dear brother .
'Can I really be guilty - have I really done anything wrong ?
They say it 's coquetting ...
I know it 's not him I love , but still I feel happy with him , he is so charming !
Only why did he say that ? ' she thought .
When he saw Kitty who was going away , and her mother who had met her on the steps , Levin , flushed with the violent exercise , stood still and considered .
He then took off his skates and overtook mother and daughter at the gates of the Gardens .
'Very pleased to see you , ' said the Princess . ' We are at home on Thursdays , as usual . ' 
'And to @-@ day is Thursday ! '
'We shall be glad to see you , ' said the Princess drily .
Kitty was sorry to hear that dry tone and could not resist the desire to counteract her mother 's coldness .
She turned her head and said smilingly :
Just then Oblonsky , his hat tilted on one side , with radiant face and eyes , walked into the Gardens like a joyous conqueror .
But on approaching his mother @-@ in @-@ law he answered her questions about Dolly 's health with a sorrowful and guilty air : After a few words with her in a subdued and mournful tone , he expanded his chest and took Levin 's arm .
'Well , shall we go ? ' he asked . ' I kept thinking about you , and am very , very glad you 've come , ' he went on , looking significantly into Levin 's eyes .
'Yes , yes ! Let 's go , ' answered the happy Levin , still hearing the voice saying : ' Au revoir ! ' and still seeing the smile with which it had been said .
'The Angleterre , or the Hermitage ? '
'What ? ' said Levin . ' Turbot ?
'Ah - oysters ! '
'Shall we change our plan , Levin ? ' he said , with his finger on the bill of fare and his face expressing serious perplexity . ' But are the oysters really good ?
'They may be Flensburg , but are they fresh ? '
'They only arrived yesterday . ' 
'Well then , shall we begin with oysters and change the whole plan of our dinner , eh ? '
'Would you like Buckwheat à la Russe ? ' said the Tartar , stooping over Levin like a nurse over a child .
'No , - joking apart , whatever you choose will suit me .
I 've been skating and I 'm hungry !
Don 't think that I do not appreciate your choice , ' he added , noticing a dissatisfied look on Oblonsky 's face .
'I should think so !
Say what you like , it is one of the pleasures of life ! ' said Oblonsky . ' Well then , my good fellow , bring us two - or that will be too little ... three dozen oysters , and vegetable soup ... '
But Oblonsky evidently did not wish to give him the pleasure of calling the dishes by their French names .
'What shall we have to drink ? '
'Whatever you like , only not too much ... Champagne ! ' said Levin .
However , why not ?
You like the white seal ? '
'Yes , bring us that with the oysters , and then we 'll see . ' 
'Yes , sir , and what sort of table wine ? '
'Nuit ... no , let 's have the classic Chablis . ' 
And your special cheese ? '
'No , I really don 't care , ' said Levin , unable to restrain a smile .
The Tartar darted off , his coat @-@ tails flying ; and five minutes later rushed in again , with a dish of opened oysters in pearly shells and a bottle between his fingers .
Oblonsky crumpled his starched napkin and pushed a corner of it inside his waistcoat , then , with his arms comfortably on the table , attacked the oysters .
Levin could eat oysters , though he preferred bread and cheese .
Even the Tartar , who having drawn the cork and poured the sparkling wine into the thin wide glasses was straightening his white tie , glanced with a smile of evident pleasure at Oblonsky .
'You don 't care much for oysters ? ' said Oblonsky , emptying his champagne glass - ' or perhaps you 're thinking of something else .
He wanted Levin to be in good spirits .
But Levin , if not exactly in bad spirits , felt constrained .
He was afraid of soiling that which filled his soul .
'Yes , I noticed that poor Grinevich 's nails interested you greatly , ' said Oblonsky .
'I can 't help it , ' replied Levin . ' Put yourself in my place - look at it from a country fellow 's point of view !
We try to get our hands into a state convenient to work with , and for that purpose we cut our nails and sometimes roll up our sleeves .
But here people purposely let their nails grow until they begin to curl , and have little saucers for studs to make it quite impossible for them to use their hands ! '
Oblonsky smiled merrily .
'Yes , it is a sign that rough work is unnecessary to him .
'Well , of course , ' said Oblonsky . ' The aim of civilization is to enable us to get enjoyment out of everything . ' 
'Well , if that is its aim , I 'd rather be a savage . ' 
'You are a savage as it is .
He remembered his brother Nicholas and frowned , feeling ashamed and distressed ; but Oblonsky started a subject which at once distracted his thoughts .
'Well , are you going to see our people to @-@ night ? The Shcherbatskys , I mean , ' he said , pushing away the rough and now empty oyster shells and drawing the cheese toward him , while his eyes glittered significantly .
'Yes , certainly I shall go . Though the Princess appeared to ask me rather unwillingly . ' 
'Not a bit of it !
What humbug !
It 's her grande dame manner , ' said Oblonsky . ' I shall come too , but I must first go to a musical rehearsal at the Countess Bonin 's .
How do you explain your sudden departure from Moscow ?
The Shcherbatskys asked me again and again , just as if I ought to know all about you .
Yet all I know is that you never do things as any one else does ! '
'Yes , ' said Levin slowly and with agitation . ' You are right , I am a savage .
Only my savagery lies not in having gone away then , but rather in having come back now .
I have now come ... '
'Oh , what a lucky fellow you are ! ' interrupted Oblonsky , looking straight into his eyes .
'Why ? '
'No , not behind me , but you have the future and I have the present ; and even that only half @-@ and @-@ half ! '
However , I don 't want to talk about myself , and besides it 's impossible to explain everything , ' said Oblonsky . ' Well , and why have you come to Moscow ? ...
Here , take this away ! ' he shouted to the Tartar .
'Don 't you guess ? ' answered Levin , the light shining deep in his eyes as he gazed steadily at Oblonsky .
'I do , but I can 't begin to speak about it , - by which you can judge whether my guess is right or wrong , ' said Oblonsky , looking at him with a subtle smile .
'Well , and what do you say to it ? ' asked Levin with a trembling voice , feeling that all the muscles of his face were quivering . ' What do you think of it ? '
Oblonsky slowly drank his glass of Chablis , his eyes fixed on Levin .
'There is nothing I should like better , ' said he , ' nothing !
It is the best that could happen . ' 
'But are you not making a mistake ?
Do you know what we are talking about ? ' said Levin , peering into his interlocutor 's face . ' You think it possible ? '
'No , do you really think it is possible ?
No , you must tell me all you really think !
'Why do you think so ? ' said Oblonsky , smiling at Levin 's excitement .
'Well , sometimes it seems so to me .
You know , that would be terrible both for her and for me . ' 
'Oh no ! In any case there 's nothing in it terrible for the girl .
'Wait a bit : you must take some sauce , ' said Oblonsky , stopping Levin 's hand that was pushing away the sauce @-@ boat .
Levin obediently helped himself to sauce , but would not let Oblonsky eat .
'No , wait , wait ! ' he said . ' Understand that for me it is a question of life and death .
I have never spoken to any one about it , and can speak to no one else about it .
She sees people through and through ! But more than that , she knows what is going to happen especially in regard to marriages .
For instance , she predicted that the Shahovskaya girl would marry Brenteln .
No one would believe it , but as it turned out she was right .
And she is on your side . ' 
'How do you know ? '
'In this way - she not only likes you , but says that Kitty is sure to be your wife . ' 
At these words a sudden smile brightened Levin 's face , the kind of smile that is not far from tears of tenderness .
'She says that ? ' he cried . ' I have always thought her a jewel , your wife !
But enough - enough about it ! ' and he got up .
'All right , but sit down ! '
But Levin could not sit still .
He strode up and down the little cage of a room blinking to force back his tears , and only when he had succeeded did he sit down again .
'Then why did you go away ? '
You can 't imagine what you have done for me by saying what you did !
I am so happy that I 'm acting meanly . I 've forgotten everything .
I heard to @-@ day about my brother Nicholas ... he 's here , you know ... and I forgot all about him .
It seems to me as if he too were happy .
It is like madness !
'Ah , but all the same , ' said Levin , ' looking back at my life , I tremble and curse and bitterly regret ...
'What 's to be done ? That 's the way the world is made , ' said Oblonsky .
'My one consolation is that prayer that I like so much : " Not according to my deserts but according to Thy mercy ! "
LEVIN EMPTIED HIS GLASS and they were silent for a while .
Why do you ask ? '
'Another bottle ! ' said Oblonsky , turning to the Tartar , who was filling their glasses and hovering round them just when he was not wanted .
'Why do I need to know Vronskij ? '
'The reason you ought to know Vronsky is this : he is one of your rivals . ' 
'What is he ? ' asked Levin , the expression of childlike rapture which Oblonsky had been admiring suddenly changing into an angry and unpleasant one .
'Vronsky is one of Count Cyril Ivanovich Vronsky 's sons , and a very fine sample of the gilded youth of Petersburg .
I met him in Tver when I was in the Service there and he came on conscription duty .
And he 's even more than a first @-@ rate fellow .
As I have got to know him now , he turns out to be both educated and very clever - a man who will go far . ' 
Levin frowned and was silent .
'Well , so he came here soon after you left , and as far as I can make out is head over ears in love with Kitty ; and you understand that her mother ... '
'Pardon me , but I understand nothing , ' said Levin , dismally knitting his brows .
And at once he thought of his brother Nicholas and how mean he was to forget him .
Levin leant back in his chair . His face was pale .
'But I should advise you to settle the question as soon as possible , ' Oblonsky continued , filling Levin 's glass .
'No , thanks ! I can 't drink any more , ' said Levin pushing his glass aside , ' or I shall be tipsy ...
Well , and how are you getting on ? ' he continued , evidently wishing to change the subject .
'You have so often promised to come and shoot with me - why not come this spring ? ' said Levin .
He now repented with his whole heart of having begun this conversation with Oblonsky .
His personal feelings had been desecrated by the mention of some Petersburg officer as his rival , and by Oblonsky 's conjectures and advice .
He understood what was going on in Levin 's soul .
'I 'll come some day , ' he said . ' Ah , old chap , women are the pivot on which everything turns !
He took out a cigar , and with one hand on his glass he continued : ' Give me some advice . ' 
'Why ? What is the matter ? '
'Well , it 's this .
Supposing you were married and loved your wife , but had been fascinated by another woman ...
'Excuse me , but really I ... it 's quite incomprehensible to me . It 's as if ... just as incomprehensible as if I , after eating my fill here , went into a baker 's shop and stole a roll . ' 
A woman , a dear , gentle , affectionate creature , poor and lonely , sacrifices everything .
You know that for me there are two kinds of women ... or rather , no ! There are women , and there are ...
I have never seen any charming fallen creatures , and never shall see any ; and people like that painted Frenchwoman with her curls out there by the counter , are an abomination to me , and all these fallen ones are like her . ' 
'Oh , don 't !
Christ would never have spoken those words , had he known how they would be misused !
However , I am not saying what I think , but what I feel .
I have a horror of fallen women .
You are repelled by spiders and I by those creatures .
Probably you never studied spiders and know nothing of their morals ; and it 's the same in my case ! '
'It 's all very well for you to talk like that - it 's like that gentleman in Dickens , who with his left hand threw all difficult questions over his right shoulder .
What am I to do ? Tell me , what am I to do ?
A man hardly has time to turn round , before he feels that he can no longer love his wife in that way , whatever his regard for her may be .
And then all of a sudden love crosses your path , and you 're lost , lost ! ' said Oblonsky with despair .
Levin smiled .
'Yes , I am lost , ' continued Oblonsky . ' But what am I to do ? '
'Don 't steal rolls . ' 
Oblonsky burst out laughing .
'Oh , you moralist !
But just consider , here are two women : one insists only on her rights , and her rights are your love , which you cannot give her ; and the other sacrifices herself and demands nothing .
What are you to do ?
'If you want me to say what I think of it , I can only tell you that I don 't believe in the tragedy .
And the reason is this : I think love , both kinds of love , which you remember Plato defines in his " Symposium " - both kinds of love serve as a touchstone for men .
Some men understand only the one , some only the other .
Those who understand only the non @-@ platonic love need not speak of tragedy .
For such love there can be no tragedy .
" Thank you kindly for the pleasure , good @-@ bye , " and that 's the whole tragedy .
And for the platonic love there can be no tragedy either , because there everything is clear and pure , because ... '
Here Levin recollecting his own sins and the inner struggle he had lived through added unexpectedly ,
It may very well be .
'Well , you see you are very consistent , ' said Oblonsky .
You have a consistent character yourself and you wish all the facts of life to be consistent , but they never are .
For instance you despise public service because you want work always to correspond to its aims , and that never happens .
You also want the activity of each separate man to have an aim , and love and family life always to coincide - and that doesn 't happen either .
All the variety , charm and beauty of life are made up of light and shade . ' 
He was thinking of his own affairs and not listening to Oblonsky .
Oblonsky had more than once experienced this kind of acute estrangement instead of union following a dinner with a friend , and knew what to do in such a case .
'The bill ! ' he shouted and went out into the dining @-@ hall , where he immediately saw an aide @-@ de @-@ camp of his acquaintance , and entered into conversation with him about an actress and her protector .
And immediately in conversation with the aide @-@ de @-@ camp Oblonsky felt relief and rest after the talk with Levin , who always demanded of him too great a mental and spiritual strain .
PRINCESS KITTY SHCHERBATSKAYA WAS EIGHTEEN , and this was her first season .
Her success in Society was greater than that of her two elder sisters , and greater even than her mother had expected .
Levin 's arrival at the beginning of the winter , his frequent visits and evident love for Kitty gave rise to her parents ' first serious deliberation as to her future and to disputes between them .
The Prince took Levin 's part and said he desired nothing better for Kitty .
When he suddenly left , the Princess was pleased and triumphantly said to her husband , ' You see , I was right ! '
When Vronsky appeared she was still more pleased and was strengthened in her opinion that Kitty ought to make not only a good but a brilliant match .
In the mother 's eyes there was no comparison between Levin and Vronsky .
Nothing better could be desired .
Vronsky was openly attentive to Kitty when they met at balls , danced with her , and came to the house , so there could be no doubt as to the seriousness of his intentions .
But in spite of this the mother was in a dreadful state of anxiety and agitation all that winter .
Everything was done very easily and simply .
At least so it seemed to the Princess . But in her daughters ' case she experienced how far from easy and simple the apparently easy business of marrying off a daughter really was .
Now that her youngest daughter had come out she was living through the same fears and doubts , and having even worse disputes with her husband than on her elder daughters ' account .
The Princess had grown used to this in respect to her older daughters , but now she felt that her husband 's punctiliousness had more justification .
She could see that lately social customs had changed very much and a mother 's duties had become still more difficult .
'Nowadays they don 't give us away in marriage as they used to ! ' said these young girls , and even the old people said the same .
But how marriages are now arranged the Princess could not find out from anyone .
The French way , of parents deciding a daughter 's fate , was not accepted , and was even condemned .
The English way , of giving a girl perfect freedom , was also rejected , and would have been impossible in Russian Society .
Everyone with whom the Princess discussed the subject said the same thing : ' Well , you know , in our days it is time to give up obsolete customs .
After all it 's the young people who marry and not their parents , therefore they must be left to arrange matters as they think best . ' 
That is why the Princess was more anxious about Kitty than she had been about her elder daughters .
And now she was afraid that Vronsky might content himself with merely flirting with her daughter .
She saw that Kitty was in love with him , but consoled herself with the thought that Vronsky was an honest man and therefore would not act in such a way .
At the same time she knew that the freedom now permitted made it easy for a man to turn a girl 's head , and knew how lightly men regarded an offence of that kind .
This conversation had partly reassured the Princess ; but she could not feel quite at ease .
Vronsky had told Kitty that he and his brother were so used to comply with their mother 's wishes that they never made up their minds to take an important step without consulting her .
'And I am now especially happy looking forward to my mother 's arrival from Petersburg , ' he had said .
Kitty had narrated this without attaching any special meaning to the words .
Levin 's arrival that day gave her further cause for anxiety .
'Has he been back long ? ' asked the Princess when they got home , referring to Levin .
'There is one thing I want to say ... ' the Princess began , and from her serious look Kitty guessed what was coming .
'Mama , ' she said flushing and turning quickly toward her mother , ' please , please , say nothing about it !
Her wish was the same as her mother 's , but the motive underlying her mother 's wish offended her .
'I won 't , - only this , my darling , ' said the mother , seeing tears in her daughter 's eyes , ' ... you promised not to have any secrets from me and you won 't , will you ? '
'Never , Mama , never at all , ' answered Kitty blushing as she looked her mother straight in the face . ' But I have nothing to say at present ... I ... I ... if I wished to , I should not know what to say or how ... I don 't know ... '
'No , she could not possibly tell an untruth with such eyes , ' thought the mother smiling at her agitation and joy .
The Princess smiled to think how immense and important what was going on in her own soul must appear to the poor girl .
During THE INTERVAL between dinner and the beginning of the evening party , Kitty experienced something resembling a young man 's feelings before a battle .
Her heart was beating violently and she could not fix her thoughts on anything .
When she thought of the past , she dwelt with pleasure and tenderness on her former relations with Levin .
Memories of childhood and of Levin 's friendship with her dead brother lent a peculiar poetic charm to her relations with him .
His love for her , of which she felt sure , flattered and rejoiced her , and she could think of him with a light heart .
On the other hand when she pictured to herself a future with Vronsky a brilliant vision of happiness rose up before her , while a future with Levin appeared wrapped in mist .
At half @-@ past seven , as soon as she had come down into the drawing @-@ room , the footman announced ' Constantine Dmitrich Levin ! '
The Princess was still in her bedroom , nor had the Prince yet come down .
'So it 's to be ! ' thought Kitty and the blood rushed to her heart .
Glancing at the mirror she was horrified at her pallor .
She felt sure that he had come so early on purpose to see her alone and to propose to her .
And now for the first time the matter presented itself to her in a different and entirely new light .
Because the dear fellow was in love with her .
But it could not be helped , it was necessary and had to be done .
'Oh God , must I tell him so myself ? ' she thought . ' Must I really tell him that I don 't care for him ?
I 'll go away .
She was already approaching the door when she heard his step .
What have I to fear ?
I have done nothing wrong .
I 'll tell the truth , come what may !
Besides , it 's impossible to feel awkward with him .
Here he is ! ' she thought , as she saw his powerful diffident figure before her and his shining eyes gazing at her .
She looked straight into his face as if entreating him to spare her , and gave him her hand .
When he saw that his expectation was fulfilled and that nothing prevented his speaking to her , his face clouded over .
'But all I wanted was to find you alone , ' he began , still standing and avoiding her face so as not to lose courage .
She was so tired yesterday ... '
She spoke without knowing what she was saying , her eyes fixed on him with a caressing look full of entreaty .
Her head dropped lower and lower , knowing the answer she would give to what was coming .
'That it would depend on you , ' he repeated . ' I want to say ...
I want to say ... I came on purpose ... that ... to be my wife ! ' he uttered hardly knowing what he said ; but feeling that the worst was out he stopped and looked at her .
She was breathing heavily and not looking at him .
She was filled with rapture .
Her soul was overflowing with happiness .
She had not at all expected that his declaration of love would make so strong an impression on her .
But that lasted only for an instant .
She remembered Vronsky , lifted her clear , truthful eyes to Levin 's face , and noticing his despair she replied quickly :
'It cannot be ... forgive me . ' 
And how estranged and distant she seemed now !
'Nothing else was possible , ' he said , without looking at her , and bowing he turned to go ...
BUT JUST AT THAT moment the Princess came in .
An expression of terror appeared in her face on seeing them alone together and noticing their troubled looks .
Levin bowed to her and said nothing .
'Thank Heaven she has refused him , ' thought the mother , and her face brightened into the usual smile with which she greeted her visitors on Thursday evenings .
She sat down and began questioning Levin about his life in the country .
He too sat down until the arrival of other guests should enable him to get away unnoticed .
She was a thin , sallow , nervous , ailing woman with shining black eyes .
She always disliked Levin , whom at the beginning of the winter she had often met at the Shcherbatskys .
Her constant and favourite amusement was to make fun of him .
'I love it when he looks down at me from the height of his dignity , or breaks off his clever conversation because I am too stupid , or when he shows his condescension toward me .
I am very glad he hates me , ' she used to say with reference to him .
The Countess at once attacked Levin .
'Why , of course , I always write them down .
Well , Kitty , have you been skating again ? '
She began to talk with Kitty .
He was about to rise , when the Princess noticing his silence turned toward him and said :
'Have you come to Moscow for long ?
But I believe you are on the Zemstvo and cannot stay away long ? '
'No , Princess , I am no longer on the Zemstvo , ' he answered , ' I have come to Moscow for a few days . ' 
'Something out of the common has happened to him , ' thought the Countess Nordston , scrutinizing his stern and serious face ; ' why does he not start on one of his discourses ?
But I 'll draw him out , I do love to make a fool of him when Kitty 's about , and I will . ' 
What is the explanation ?
At that moment another lady entered the room and Levin rose .
'Excuse me , Countess , but really I know nothing about it , and can 't tell you anything , ' he said , and as he turned he saw an officer who had come into the room behind the lady .
'That must be Vronsky , ' he thought , and looked at Kitty to make sure .
She had already glanced at Vronsky and then turned toward Levin .
And by the look of her eyes which had involuntarily brightened Levin realized that she loved this man , realized it as surely as if she had told it him in so many words .
But what kind of man was he ?
Now , rightly or wrongly , Levin could not but remain . He had to find out what sort of a man it was that she loved .
It struck him immediately .
Vronsky was a dark sturdily @-@ built man of medium height , with a good @-@ natured , handsome , exceedingly quiet and firm face .
Everything about his face and figure - from his black closely @-@ cropped hair and freshly @-@ shaven chin to his wide , brand @-@ new uniform - was simple and at the same time elegant .
Having stepped aside to let a lady pass , Vronsky approached first the Princess and then Kitty .
Having greeted and spoken a few words to every one else , he sat down without having once looked at Levin , who had not taken his eyes off him .
'Let me introduce you , ' said the Princess indicating Levin . ' Constantine Dmitrich Levin , Count Alexis Kirilovich Vronsky . ' 
Vronsky rose and looking cordially into Levin 's eyes pressed his hand .
'I was to have dined with you earlier this winter , ' he said with his simple frank smile , ' but you unexpectedly went away to the country . ' 
'My words , must make a deep impression on you for you to remember them so long , ' said Levin ; then recollecting that he had said this before he blushed .
Vronsky glanced at him and at the Countess , and smiled .
'And do you always live in the country ? ' he asked . ' Isn 't it dull in the winter ? '
'No , not when one is busy : nor need one be dull in one 's own company , ' replied Levin abruptly .
'I am fond of the country , ' said Vronsky , noticing , but pretending not to notice , Levin 's tone .
'But I hope , Count , you would not consent always to live in the country , ' said the Countess Nordston .
I have experienced a curious feeling , ' he went on . ' Nowhere have I felt so homesick for the country , our Russian country , with its peasants in bark @-@ shoes , as when I spent a winter with my mother in Nice .
And Naples and Sorrento are pleasant only for a short stay , and it is there that one thinks of Russia , and longs especially for the Russian countryside .
He was addressing both Kitty and Levin , his quiet and friendly glance passing from the one to the other . He was evidently speaking quite sincerely and frankly .
Noticing that the Countess Nordston wished to say something , he stopped without finishing what he was saying , and listened attentively to her .
Levin wished to join in the general conversation , but found it impossible , and kept saying to himself , ' Now I will go , ' yet he did not go , but waited for something indefinite .
The conversation touched on table @-@ turning and spiritualism , and the Countess Nordston , who believed in spiritualism , began relating miracles she had witnessed .
I have never seen anything supernatural though I always look out for it , ' said Vronsky smiling .
'Very well , next Saturday , ' replied the Countess Nordston . ' And you ; Mr. Levin , do you believe in it ? ' she asked , turning to him .
'Why do you ask me ?
You know very well what I shall say . ' 
'But I want to hear your opinion . ' 
'My opinion is that this table @-@ turning proves that our so @-@ called educated class is on the same level as the peasants .
They believe in the evil eye and spells and witchcraft , while we ... '
'Well then , you don 't believe ? '
'I can 't believe , Countess ! '
'Then you think I am not telling the truth ? ' and she laughed mirthlessly .
'You don 't admit that it is even possible ? ' he asked . ' But why not ?
We admit the existence of electricity , which we don 't understand , why can 't there be other forces which we do not yet know , but which ... '
But the Spiritualists on the contrary began by the tables writing for them and the spirits coming to them , and they only afterwards began to say that it was an unknown force . ' 
Vronsky listened attentively to Levin as he always listened , evidently interested in what he was saying .
'Yes , but the Spiritualists say , " We do not yet know what force it is , but it exists and these are the conditions under which it acts .
Let the scientists discover what the force is . "
No , I do not see why it should not be a new force , if it ... '
Probably feeling that the conversation was becoming too serious for a drawing @-@ room , Vronsky did not reply , but in order to change the subject he smiled gaily and turned toward the ladies .
'Let us try now , Countess , ' he began , but Levin wanted to finish saying what he thought .
'I think , ' he continued , ' that this attempt of the Spiritualists to explain their wonders by some kind of new force is most unsuccessful .
Everybody waited for him to finish and he was conscious of it .
'I think you would make a splendid medium , ' said the Countess Nordston ; ' there is something ecstatic about you . ' 
Levin opened his mouth to reply , but blushed and said nothing .
'Let us try table @-@ turning now , Princess Kitty , please do , ' said Vronsky . ' May we , Princess ? ' he said to her mother and he rose and looked round for a suitable table .
Kitty rose to fetch a table , and as she passed Levin their eyes met .
She pitied him with her whole soul , especially because she herself had caused him to suffer .
'If you can forgive me , please do , ' pleaded her look . ' I am so happy . ' 
'I hate everybody , including you and myself , ' answered his eyes ; and he took up his hat .
But he was not fated to go yet .
Just as the others began settling round the table and Levin was about to go , the old Prince came in , and having greeted the ladies he turned to Levin .
Kitty was conscious that , after what had taken place , her father 's cordiality oppressed Levin .
'Prince , release Mr. Levin for us as we want to try an experiment , ' said the Countess Nordston .
'What experiment ? Table @-@ turning ?
Vronsky 's unflinching eye glanced in astonishment at the old Prince , and slightly smiling he at once began talking to the Countess Nordston about the ball that was to take place the next week .
'I hope you will be there , ' he said to Kitty .
As soon as the old Prince had turned away from him Levin went out unobserved , and his last impression was Kitty 's happy smiling face as she answered Vronsky 's question about the ball .
AFTER THE GUESTS HAD GONE Kitty told her mother of her conversation with Levin , and in spite of all her pity for him she was pleased by the thought that she had had a proposal .
She did not doubt that she had acted rightly , yet for a long time she lay in bed unable to sleep .
Whether she repented of having drawn Levin on or of having rejected him she did not know , but her happiness was troubled by doubts .
I 'll tell you what ! ' shouted the Prince flourishing his arms and immediately again wrapping his squirrel @-@ lined dressing @-@ gown around him . ' You have no pride , no dignity , you disgrace and ruin your daughter by this vile idiotic match @-@ making . ' 
'For goodness ' sake , Prince , what in heaven 's own name have I done ? ' said the Princess almost in tears .
And when she said that , the Prince suddenly flared up and began to shout rudely :
'What have you done ?
Why this : first of all you entice a suitor . All Moscow will talk about it and with reason .
If you give a party invite everybody and not only selected suitors .
Invite all the young puppies , ' so the Prince called the Moscow young men , ' have a pianist and let them dance ; but don 't have the sort of thing we had to @-@ night - these suitors and this pairing off .
Levin is a thousand times the better man .
This one is a little Petersburg fop . They are machine @-@ made by the dozen , all to one pattern , and all mere rubbish .
But even if he were a Prince of the blood my daughter does not need him . ' 
'Just this ... ' exclaimed the Prince angrily .
'I know this much , ' the Princess interrupted him , ' that if I were to listen to what you say we should never see our daughter married , and we had better go and live in the country . ' 
'So we had ! '
Do I draw them on ?
No , certainly not , but a young man and an excellent young man falls in love with Kitty , and she too seems ... '
'But why do you suppose such a thing ? '
I can recognize a man who has serious intentions - such as Levin - and I can see through a weathercock like that popinjay who only wishes to amuse himself . ' 
'All right . All right , don 't let 's talk , ' said the Princess , interrupting him and remembering the unfortunate Dolly .
'Very well then , good @-@ night . ' 
And having made the sign of the cross over one another and kissed , feeling that each of them retained their individual opinions , the couple separated for the night .
VRONSKY HAD NEVER KNOWN FAMILY LIFE .
His mother in her youth had been a brilliant Society woman , and during her married life and especially in her widowhood had had many love affairs , known to everybody .
He hardly remembered his father , and had been educated in the Cadet Corps .
On leaving that Corps as a very young and brilliant officer he at once joined the swim of the wealthy military Petersburg set .
Though he occasionally went into the highest Petersburg Society , all his love interests lay outside it .
In Moscow , after this luxurious course of Petersburg life , he experienced for the first time the delight of intimacy with a sweet , innocent Society girl who fell in love with him .
It never entered his head that there could be any wrong in his relations with Kitty .
At balls he danced chiefly with her and he visited her at her home .
He talked with her the usual Society talk : all sorts of rubbish , but rubbish into which involuntarily he put a special meaning for her .
He thought he was the first to discover this pleasure and he enjoyed his discovery .
He would not have believed that what gave so much and such excellent pleasure to him , and - what was more - to her , could be wrong .
Every less could he have believed that he ought to marry .
Marriage had never presented itself to him as a possibility .
And how sweetly , simply , and above all trustfully !
I feel myself better and purer , I feel I have a heart and that there is much that is good in me .
Those dear loving eyes ! when she said , " and very much . "
It 's pleasant for me and for her , ' and he considered where he should finish his evening .
He passed in review the places he might go to .
'The Club : a game of bezique , a bottle of champagne with Ignatev ?
That 's just what I like about the Shcherbatskys ' , that I myself become better there .
He went straight to his rooms at the Hotel Dusseau , had supper , and after undressing had hardly laid his head on his pillow before he was fast asleep .
'Hallo , your Excellency ! ' exclaimed Oblonsky . ' Whom are you after ? '
'I waited for you till two last night ; where did you go from the Shcherbatskys ' ? '
'- " Fiery steeds by " something " brands / I can always recognize ; / Youths in love ... " - ' declaimed Oblonsky , just as he had done to Levin .
'Oh ! Mrs. Karenina ! ' said Vronsky .
'I expect you know her ? '
'I think I do .
I really can 't remember , ' answered Vronsky absent @-@ mindedly , the name Karenina suggesting to him some one stiff and dull .
'But you are sure to know Alexis Alexandrovich Karenin , my famous brother @-@ in @-@ law .
'Yes , I know him by repute and by sight .
I know he is clever , learned , and by way of being religious , but you know it is not my ... not in my line , ' he added in English .
'Oh yes , he is a very remarkable man , a bit conservative , but a splendid fellow , ' said Oblonsky , ' a splendid fellow . ' 
'Well , so much the better for him , ' and Vronsky smiled . ' Ah , you are here ! ' he went on , turning toward his mother 's old footman who was standing by the door . ' Come in here . ' 
Besides liking Oblonsky , as everybody did , Vronsky latterly had felt still more drawn to him because he was connected in his mind with Kitty .
'Well , are we to give a supper to the diva next Sunday ? ' he asked smilingly , taking Oblonsky 's arm .
I say , did you make the acquaintance of my friend Levin last night ? ' asked Oblonsky .
'He is a splendid fellow , ' continued Oblonsky . ' Don 't you think so ? '
'I don 't know how it is that all Muscovites , present company of course excepted , ' Vronsky put in jokingly , ' are so abrupt .
They are always standing on their hind legs getting angry , and seem to want to act on your feelings ... '
'Yes , there is some truth in that , ' said Oblonsky , laughing merrily .
'Shall we have to wait much longer ? ' asked Vronsky , turning to a porter .
'The train is signalled , ' said the porter .
The approach of the train was made more and more evident by the increasing bustle and preparation on the platform and the arrival of people who had come to meet the train .
Through the frosty mist one could see workmen in sheepskin coats and felt boots crossing the curved railway lines , and hear the whistle of a locomotive and the noisy movements of a heavy mass .
'No , ' said Oblonsky who was anxious to tell Vronsky about Levin 's intentions concerning Kitty , ' no , you have not judged my Levin rightly .
Vronsky stopped and asked him straight out :
'What do you mean ?
Did he propose to your belle soeur last night '
'Perhaps , ' said Oblonsky . ' I seemed to notice something of the kind yesterday .
Oh yes , if he left early and was in a bad temper it must be that ...
Vronsky , as he stood by Oblonsky and watched these passengers coming out of the carriages , quite forgot about his mother .
His chest involuntarily expanded and his eyes shone , he felt himself to be a conqueror .
'The Countess Vronskaya is in that compartment , ' said the sprightly guard , addressing Vronsky .
His words roused Vronsky from his reverie and reminded him of his mother and of the coming meeting .
VRONSKY FOLLOWED THE GUARD to the carriage arid had to stop at the entrance of the compartment to let a lady pass out .
The trained insight of a Society man enabled Vronsky with a single glance to decide that she belonged to the best Society .
When he looked round she too turned her head .
In that short look Vronsky had time to notice the subdued animation that enlivened her face and seemed to flutter between her bright eyes and a scarcely perceptible smile which curved her rosy lips .
It was as if an excess of vitality so filled her whole being that it betrayed itself against her will , now in her smile , now in the light of her eyes .
She deliberately tried to extinguish that light in her eyes , but it shone despite of her in her faint smile .
Vronsky entered the carriage .
His mother , a thin old woman with black eyes and curled hair , screwed up her eyes as she recognized her son and her thin lips smiled slightly .
'You had my telegram ?
'Have you had a good journey ? ' asked her son , sitting down on the seat beside her and involuntarily listening to a woman 's voice outside the door .
He knew it was the voice of the lady he had met as he entered the carriage .
'All the same I don 't agree with you , ' the lady was saying .
'Yours are Petersburg views , madam . ' 
'Not at all , simply a woman 's views . ' 
'Well , have you found your brother ? ' asked Vronsky 's mother , addressing the lady .
Vronsky understood now that this was Mrs. Karenina .
'Your brother is here , ' he said rising . ' Excuse my not recognizing you before . Our acquaintance was so slight , ' he said with a bow , ' that I am sure you do not remember me . ' 
Vronsky went out on to the platform and shouted , ' Oblonsky !
Here ! '
Vronsky did not take his eyes off her , and kept smiling , he knew not why .
But remembering that his mother was waiting for him he went back into the carriage .
'She is very charming , isn 't she ? ' said the Countess , referring to Mrs. Karenina . ' Her husband put her into the compartment with me and I was very pleased .
We talked all the way .
'I don 't know what you mean , maman , ' the son replied coldly . ' Well , shall we go ? '
Mrs. Karenina again entered the carriage to take leave of the Countess .
'There , Countess , you have met your son and I my brother , ' she said , ' and I have exhausted my stock of stories and should have had nothing more to tell you . ' 
'No , no , ' said the Countess holding her hand , ' I could travel round the world with you and not be dull .
You are one of those charming women with whom it is nice to talk , and nice to be silent . But please don 't fret about your son , you can 't expect never to be parted . ' 
Mrs. Karenina stood very erect and her eyes were smiling .
'Anna Arkadyevna Karenina has a son who , I think , is eight years old , ' explained the Countess , ' and she has never before been separated from him and so she is worried at having left him . ' 
'Yes , the Countess and I have talked all the time - I about my son and she about hers , ' said Mrs. Karenina , and a smile brightened her face , a kind smile on his account .
'I expect you got very weary of it , ' he said , quickly seizing in its flight the ball of coquetry she had thrown at him .
But she evidently did not wish to continue the conversation in that tone , and turned to the old Countess .
'Thank you very much .
I hardly noticed how the time passed .
'Good @-@ bye , dear ! ' answered the Countess .
'Let me kiss your pretty face .
Conventional as the phrase was , Mrs. Karenina evidently believed it and was pleased .
She blushed , stooped a little , and held out her face for the Countess to kiss , then she stood up again , and with the same smile hovering between her lips and eyes held out her hand to Vronsky .
He pressed the little hand , and the firm grip with which she shook his gave him unusual pleasure .
She went out with that brisk tread which carried her rather full figure with such wonderful ease .
'Very charming , ' said the old lady .
He followed her with his eyes as long as he could see her graceful form , and his face retained its smile .
'Well , maman , are you quite well ? ' he said , turning toward his mother .
Alexander was very nice , and Varya looks very handsome .
And she began to tell about what interested her most , her grandson 's christening , for which she had gone to Petersburg , and the special favour the Emperor had shown to her eldest son .
'Here is Lavrenty at last , ' said Vronsky looking out of the window . ' We can go now if you like . ' 
The old major @-@ domo , who had accompanied the Countess on her journey , came in and announced that everything was ready , and the Countess rose to go .
'Come , there is not much of a crowd now , ' said Vronsky .
Vronsky gave his arm to his mother , but , just as they were coming out of the carriage , several people ran past them with frightened faces .
The station @-@ master with his peculiar coloured cap also ran past them .
Evidently something unusual had happened .
Where ? ...
Thrown himself under ... Run over ... ' shouted the passers @-@ by .
Oblonsky , with his sister on his arm , also turned back , and , avoiding the crowd , stood with frightened faces beside the carriage .
The ladies re @-@ entered the carriage , while Vronsky and Oblonsky followed the crowd , to find out about the accident .
A watchman , either tipsy or too much muffled up because of the severe frost , had not heard a tram that was being shunted , and had been run over .
Before Vronsky and Oblonsky returned the ladies had heard this from the major @-@ domo .
Oblonsky and Vronsky had both seen the mangled corpse .
Oblonsky was evidently suffering .
His face was puckered and he seemed ready to cry .
'Ah , how terrible !
Oh , Anna , if you had seen it !
Ah , how terrible ! ' he kept saying .
Vronsky remained silent . His handsome face was serious but perfectly calm .
'Oh , if you had seen it , Countess , ' said Oblonsky . And his wife was there ...
She threw herself on the body .
'Can nothing be done for her ? ' said Mrs. Karenina in an agitated whisper .
Vronsky glanced at her and at once went out .
'I will be back directly , maman , ' he added , turning at the doorway .
When he returned a few minutes later Oblonsky was already talking to the Countess about the new opera singer , while she was impatiently glancing at the door in expectation of her son .
'Now let 's go , ' said Vronsky as he came in .
They went together , Vronsky walking in front with his mother , Mrs. Karenina following with her brother .
At the exit the stationmaster overtook them , and said to Vronsky :
'For the widow , ' said Vronsky , shrugging his shoulders . ' I don 't understand what need there is to ask . ' 
'You have given it ! ' exclaimed Oblonsky behind Vronsky , and pressing his sister 's arm he added , ' Very kind , very kind !
Isn 't he a fine fellow ?
My respects to you , Countess , ' and he remained behind with his sister , seeking her maid .
When they came out , the Vronskys ' carriage had already started .
The people coming from the station were still talking about the accident .
'What a terrible death ! ' said some gentleman as he passed them ; ' cut in half , I hear . ' 
'On the contrary , I think it is a very easy death , instantaneous , ' said another .
'How is it that precautions are not taken ? ' said a third .
Mrs. Karenina got into her brother 's carriage , and Oblonsky noticed with surprise that her lips were trembling and that it was with difficulty she kept back her tears .
'What is the matter with you , Anna ? ' he asked when they had gone a few hundred yards .
'What nonsense ! ' said Oblonsky . ' You 're here , and that is the chief thing .
You can 't think how my hopes rest on you . ' 
'And have you known Vronsky long ? ' she asked .
Do you know we hope he will marry Kitty ? '
'Yes , all my hopes are fixed on you , ' said her brother .
And Oblonsky began his story .
On reaching his house , he helped his sister out of the carriage , pressed her hand , and drove off to his office .
WHEN ANNA ARRIVED Dolly was sitting in her little drawing @-@ room giving a fair @-@ haired , plump little boy ( who already resembled his father ) a French reading @-@ lesson .
His mother moved his plump little hand away several times , but it always returned to the button .
Though she had sent word to her husband the day before that she did not care whether his sister came or not , she had prepared everything for her visit and awaited her with agitation .
Dolly was overpowered by her sorrow and was quite absorbed by it .
Nevertheless , she remembered that her sister @-@ in @-@ law , Anna , was the wife of one of the most important men in Petersburg , and a grande dame .
It was true that , as far as she could remember her visit to the Karenins in Petersburg , she had not liked their house : there seemed to be something false in the tone of their family life .
All these last days Dolly had been alone with her children .
She did not wish to talk about her sorrow , yet with that on her mind she could not talk about indifferent matters .
As it often happens , though she kept looking at the clock , waiting for Anna , she let the moment when her visitor arrived go by without even hearing the bell .
And when she heard soft steps and the rustle of petticoats already in the doorway , she looked round with an expression not of pleasure but of surprise on her careworn face .
'Dolly , I am so pleased to see you ! '
'And I am pleased too , ' said Dolly with a feeble smile trying to guess from Anna 's expression how much she knew .
Dear me , how he has grown ! ' said Anna , and having kissed him , she stood with her eyes fixed on Dolly and blushed . ' No , please do not let us go anywhere . ' 
She took off her shawl and her hat and , having caught it in her black and very curly hair , shook her head to disengage it .
'And you are radiant with joy and health ! ' said Dolly almost enviously .
'Why , dear me , here is Tanya !
She not only mentioned them all by name , but remembered the years and even the months of their births , their characters , and what illnesses they had had ; and Dolly could not help appreciating this .
'Shall we go and see them ? ' she said . ' It is a pity Vasya is asleep . ' 
Anna took hold of the tray , but then pushed it aside .
She expected now to hear words of insincere sympathy : but Anna said nothing of the kind .
'Dolly dear ! ' she began , ' I do not wish to take his part or console you ; that would be impossible , but , dearest , I am simply sorry for you , sorry from the bottom of my heart ! '
Her bright eyes under their thick lashes suddenly filled with tears .
The latter did not draw back from her but her face retained its rigid expression .
'It is impossible to console me .
Everything is lost after what has happened , everything destroyed ! '
As soon as she had said it her face softened .
'But what is to be done , Dolly , what is to be done ?
What is the best way of acting in this dreadful position ? That is what one has to consider . ' 
'Everything is at an end , and that 's all , ' said Dolly . ' And the worst of it is , you understand , that I can 't leave him : there are the children , and I am bound .
Yet I can 't live with him ; it is torture for me to see him . ' 
'Dolly , my darling , he has spoken to me , but I want to hear it from you . Tell me everything . ' 
Dolly looked at her inquiringly .
Sincere sympathy and affection were visible in Anna 's face .
'If you like , ' said Dolly suddenly , ' but I 'll begin from the beginning .
With the education Mama gave me , I was not merely naive , but silly ! I knew nothing .
I know they say husbands tell their wives how they have lived , but Steve ... ' She corrected herself .
'But Stephen Arkadyevich never told me anything . You will hardly believe it , but up to now I thought I was the only woman he had ever known .
In this way I lived for nine years .
Only think , that I not only did not suspect him of unfaithfulness , but thought it impossible . I then ... just imagine , with such ideas suddenly to find out all the horrors , all the abomination ...
Try to understand me .
To be fully convinced of one 's happiness and suddenly ... ' continued Dolly , suppressing her sobs , ' to read a letter , his letter to his mistress , my children 's governess . No , it is too horrible ! '
'Oh yes , I do , I do understand , Dolly dear , I do understand , ' said Anna , pressing her hand .
'And do you think he realizes the horror of my situation ? ' continued Dolly . ' Not at all !
'Oh no , ' Anna quickly interrupted . ' He is pitiable , he is overwhelmed with remorse ... '
'Is he capable of remorse ? ' interrupted Dolly , looking searchingly into her sister @-@ in @-@ law 's face .
I could not look at him without pity .
We both know him .
'Yes , I understand that his position is dreadful ; it is worse for the guilty than for the innocent one , ' she said , ' if he feels that the misfortune all comes from his fault .
But how can I forgive him , how can I be a wife to him after her ? ...
Life with him now will be a torture for me , just because I love my old love for him ... '
Sobs cut short her words .
But as if intentionally every time she softened , she again began to speak of the thing that irritated her .
'You know she is young , she is pretty , ' she said . ' You see , Anna , my youth and my good looks have been sacrificed , and to whom ?
For him and his children .
I have served his purpose and lost all I had in the service , and of course a fresh , good @-@ for @-@ nothing creature now pleases him better .
I could kill him ... '
'Dolly dearest ! I understand , but don 't torture yourself .
You are so deeply hurt , so upset , that you see many things in the wrong light . ' 
'What am I to do ? Think it over , Anna , help me !
Anna could not think of anything , but her heart responded to every word and every look of Dolly 's .
He can hardly believe now - can hardly understand - how he could do it . ' 
'No , he understands and understood , ' Dolly interrupted . ' And I ... you forget me ... Does it make it easier for me ? '
When he was speaking to me , I confess I did not quite realize the misery of your position .
'I know the world better than you do , ' she said . ' I know men like Steve and how they see these things .
You think he spoke to her about you .
That never happens .
These men may be unfaithful , but their homes , their wives , are their holy places .
They manage in some way to hold these women in contempt and don 't let them interfere with the family .
They seem to draw some kind of line between the family and those others .
I do not understand it , but it is so . ' 
'Dolly , wait a bit .
I have seen Steve when he was in love with you .
You know we used to laugh at him because his every third word was , " Dolly is a wonderful woman . "
You have been and still are his divinity , and this infatuation never reached his soul ... '
'But suppose the infatuation is repeated ? '
'It cannot be , as I understand ... '
'And you , would you forgive ? '
Yes , I can , ' said Anna , after a minute 's consideration . Her mind had taken in and weighed the situation , and she added , ' Yes , I can , I can .
Yes , I should forgive .
I should not remain the same woman - no , but I should forgive , and forgive it as utterly as if it had never happened at all . ' 
'Well , of course ... ' Dolly put in quickly as if saying what she had often herself thought , ' or else it would not be forgiveness .
If one is to forgive , it must be entire forgiveness .
She spent the earlier part of the day with Dolly and the children , and sent a note to her brother to be sure and come home to dinner .
'Come , ' she wrote . ' God is merciful . ' 
Oblonsky dined at home , the conversation was general , and his wife addressed him familiarly in the second person singular , which she had not done all these days .
There was still the same estrangement in their manner to each other , but no longer any question of separating , and Oblonsky saw that explanation and reconciliation were possible .
She knew Anna , but only slightly , and came to her sister 's not without fear of how she might be received by this Petersburg Society woman whom everybody admired so much .
But she noticed at once that Anna liked her .
Kitty felt that Anna was perfectly unaffected and was not trying to conceal anything , but that she lived in another , higher world full of complex poetic interests beyond Kitty 's reach .
After dinner , when Dolly had gone to her own room , Anna got up quickly and went to her brother who was just lighting a cigar .
He understood , threw down his cigar , and disappeared through the door .
When Oblonsky had gone , she returned to the sofa where she had been sitting surrounded by the children .
'Now how were we sitting before ? ' said Anna , resuming her seat .
And Grisha again pushed his head under her arm and leaning against her dress beamed with pride and joy .
'And when is the ball to be ? ' said Anna , turning to Kitty .
'Next week , and it will be a delightful ball .
One of those balls which are always jolly . ' 
'Are there any that are always jolly ? ' asked Anna with tender irony .
'It is strange , but there are !
'How can you be dull at a ball ? '
'Why cannot I be dull at a ball ? ' asked Anna .
'Because you must always be the belle of the ball . ' 
Anna had a capacity for blushing .
'In the first place , I never am : but even if I were , what use would it be to me ? '
'I suppose I shall have to .
Here , take this , ' she said , turning to Tanya who was drawing off a ring which fitted loosely on her aunt 's small tapering finger .
'I shall be very glad if you go . I should so like to see you at a ball . ' 
'Well , then , if I have to go , I shall console myself with the reflection that it will give you pleasure ...
Grisha , please don 't pull so hard , it is all in a tangle already , ' she said , arranging a loose lock of hair with which Grisha was playing .
'I imagine you at that ball in lilac ! '
'Why must it be lilac ? ' asked Anna half laughing . ' Now , children , run away , run away .
There 's Miss Hull calling you to tea , ' she went on , disengaging herself from the children and dispatching them to the dining @-@ room .
'But I know why you are asking me to go to that ball .
You 're expecting much from it , and would like everybody to be there and have a share in it . ' 
'How do you know ?
Who has not passed through it ? '
Kitty smiled and remained silent .
How I should like to know her story ! ' thought she , recollecting the unpoetic appearance of Anna 's husband Alexis Karenin .
I like him very much , ' Anna continued . ' I met Vronsky at the railway station . ' 
'Oh , was he there ? ' asked Kitty , blushing . ' What did Steve tell you ? '
'Steve let it all out to me , and I shall be very pleased .
'What did his mother tell you ? '
'Oh very much ! and I know he is her favourite , but anyone can see he is full of chivalry ...
For instance she told me that he wished to give all his property to his brother , that already as a boy he had done something extraordinary , saved a woman from drowning .
In a word , he is a hero , ' said Anna , smiling and remembering the 200 roubles he had given away at the station .
For some reason she did not like to think about them .
She felt that there had been something in it relating personally to her that should not have been .
'She particularly wished me to go and see her , ' continued Anna . ' I shall be glad to see the old lady again , and will go to @-@ morrow .
Well , thank heaven Steve is stopping a long time with Dolly , ' she added changing the subject , and she rose , dissatisfied with something , Kitty thought .
'I was first ! ' ' No , I ! ' cried the children , who having finished their tea rushed back to Aunt Anna .
'All together ! ' said Anna laughing and running to meet them , and putting her arms round them she tumbled the whole heap of children - struggling and shrieking joyfully - on to the floor .
Oblonsky did not appear .
He had probably left his wife 's room by the other door .
'I 'm afraid you will be cold upstairs , ' remarked Dolly to Anna . ' I want to move you down , and then we shall be nearer to one another . ' 
'Oh , please don 't trouble about me , ' said Anna , scrutinizing Dolly 's face and trying to discover whether a reconciliation had taken place .
'I assure you that I sleep always and anywhere like a dormouse . ' 
'What are you talking about ? ' asked Oblonsky , entering the room from his study and addressing his wife .
From his tone both Kitty and Anna gathered that a reconciliation had taken place .
'I want to move Anna downstairs , only the curtains must be changed .
I shall have to do it myself , no one else can do it , ' Dolly answered addressing him .
'Goodness knows if they have quite made it up , ' thought Anna on hearing her tone , which was cold and calm .
'Come now , Dolly ! always making difficulties , ' said her husband . ' If you like I will do it all . ' 
'Yes , they must have come together again , ' thought Anna .
'Yes , a full , a full reconciliation , quite complete . Thank God ! ' thought Anna , and pleased to have been the means of bringing it about , she went up to Dolly and kissed her .
'Not at all . Why do you so despise Matthew and me ? ' said Oblonsky , turning to his wife with a slight smile .
While they were talking about their mutual Petersburg acquaintances Anna rose suddenly .
'I have her photo in my album , ' said she , ' and I 'll show you my Serezha 's too , ' she added with a mother 's proud smile .
She longed to look at his portrait and to talk about him .
Seizing the first opportunity she rose and , stepping firmly and lightly , went out to fetch her album .
The flight of stairs to her room went up from a landing of the well @-@ heated front staircase .
As she was coming out of the drawing @-@ room there was a ring at the door .
'Who can it be ? ' asked Dolly .
Anna looked down from the landing where she stood and at once recognized Vronsky , and a strange feeling of pleasure mixed with fear suddenly stirred in her heart .
He stood in his overcoat , feeling for something in his pockets .
When Anna was half @-@ way up the top flight , he lifted his eyes and saw her , and a look of something like embarrassment and fear came into his face .
She bowed slightly and went on . She heard Oblonsky 's loud voice downstairs asking him to come in , and Vronsky 's low , soft voice refusing .
'He seemed so queer , ' added Oblonsky .
'He has been to our house , ' she thought , ' and not finding me in he guessed that I was here . And he would not come in because Anna is here , and he thought it too late . ' 
They all glanced at one another and said nothing but began examining Anna 's album .
There was nothing extraordinary or strange in the fact that a man had called at half @-@ past nine at a friend 's house to ask about a dinner they were planning and that he would not come in ; but it seemed strange to all of them .
To Anna in particular it seemed strange and not right .
THE BALL HAD ONLY JUST BEGUN when Kitty and her mother ascended the broad staircase which was deluged with light , decorated with flowering plants , and occupied by powdered footmen in red liveries .
She had given the first quadrille to Vronsky and had to give the second to this youth .
It was one of Kitty 's happy days .
All three buttons on each of her long gloves , which fitted without changing the shape of her hand , fastened without coming off .
That ribbon was charming , and when Kitty had looked at her neck in the glass at home , she felt that that ribbon was eloquent .
There might be some possible doubt about anything else , but that ribbon was charming .
Kitty smiled , here at the ball , when she caught sight of it again in the mirror .
Her bare shoulders and arms gave her a sensation as of cold marble , a feeling she liked very much .
Her eyes shone and she could not keep her rosy lips from smiling at the consciousness of her attractive appearance .
She looked about for some one to hold her fan and the mistress of the house took it from her with a smile .
'How fine that you have come in good time , ' he said with his arm round her waist . ' It 's wrong of people to come so late . ' 
Bending her left arm she put her hand on his shoulder , and her little feet in their pink shoes began moving quickly , lightly , and rhythmically in time with the music , over the smooth parquet floor .
She smiled at his praise , and over his shoulder continued to survey the ball @-@ room .
'Shall we have another turn ?
You are not tired ? ' asked Korsunsky who was a little out of breath .
'I believe Anna Arkadyevna Karenina is here , take me to her . ' 
Korsunsky bowed , straightened his broad shirt front , and offered Kitty his arm to conduct her to Anna .
Kitty flushed and , a little giddy , took her train off Krivin 's knees and looked round for Anna .
Her dress was richly trimmed with Venetian lace .
In her black hair , all her own , she wore a little garland of pansies , and in her girdle , among the lace , a bunch of the same flowers .
Her coiffure was very unobtrusive .
The only noticeable things about it were the wilful ringlets that always escaped at her temples and on the nape of her neck and added to her beauty .
Round her finely chiselled neck she wore a string of pearls .
Kitty had been seeing Anna every day and was in love with her and had always imagined her in lilac , but seeing her in black she felt that she had never before realized her full charm .
She now saw her in a new and quite unexpected light .
She now realized that Anna could not have worn lilac , and that her charm lay precisely in the fact that her personality always stood out from her dress , that her dress was never conspicuous on her .
And her black velvet with rich lace was not at all conspicuous , but served only as a frame ; she alone was noticeable - simple , natural , elegant and at the same time merry and animated .
She was standing among that group , very erect as usual , and was talking to the master of the house with her head slightly turned toward him , when Kitty approached .
'No , I am not going to throw the first stone , ' she was saying in reply to some question , adding , with a shrug of her shoulders , ' although I cannot understand it ' ; and at once she turned to Kitty with a tender protecting smile .
'Oh , you know one another ? ' asked the host .
My wife and I are like white wolves , every one knows us , ' answered Korsunsky . ' Anna Arkadyevna , just one turn ? '
'I don 't dance if it is possible not to , ' she said .
'But to @-@ night it is not possible , ' he rejoined .
At that moment Vronsky approached .
'Well , if it is impossible not to dance to @-@ night , let us dance , ' she said taking no notice of Vronsky 's bow and quickly putting her hand on Korsunsky 's shoulder .
'Why is she displeased with him ? ' thought Kitty , noticing that Anna had intentionally taken no notice of Vronsky 's bow .
He came up to Kitty , reminding her of the first quadrille and regretting that he had not seen her for such a long time .
Kitty , while gazing with admiration at Anna waltzing , listened to him , expecting him to ask her to waltz , but he did not do so and she glanced at him with surprise .
He blushed and hurriedly asked her to dance , but scarcely had he put his arm round her slim waist and taken one step when the music stopped .
'Pardon , pardon , a waltz - a waltz , ' shouted Korsunsky from the other end of the room , and seizing the first girl within reach he himself began dancing .
VRONSKY AND KITTY WALTZED several times round the room and then Kitty went to her mother , but hardly had she exchanged a few words with the Countess Nordston before Vronsky returned to fetch her for the first quadrille .
It seemed to her that the mazurka would settle everything .
She was sure that she would dance the mazurka with him as at previous balls , and she refused five other partners for that dance , saying that she was already engaged .
The whole ball up to the last quadrille was for Kitty an enchanted dream of gay flowers , sounds and movements .
She only stopped dancing when she felt too tired and had to ask to be allowed a rest .
But while dancing the last quadrille with one of the youthful bores whom it would not do to refuse , she happened to be vis @-@ à @-@ vis to Anna .
She had not come across Anna since the beginning of the ball , and now she suddenly saw her again in a different and unexpected light .
She noticed that Anna was elated with success , a feeling Kitty herself knew so well .
She saw that Anna was intoxicated by the rapture she had produced .
'No , it is not the admiration of the crowd that intoxicates her , but the rapture of one , and that one is ... can it be he ? '
Every time he spoke to Anna the joyful light kindled in her eyes and a smile of pleasure curved her rosy lips .
She seemed to make efforts to restrain these signs of joy , but they appeared on her face of their own accord .
Kitty looked at him and was filled with horror .
What she saw so distinctly in the mirror of Anna 's face , she saw in him .
What had become of his usually quiet and firm manner and the carelessly calm expression of his face ?
Every time he turned toward Anna he slightly bowed his head as if he wished to fall down before her , and in his eyes there was an expression of submission and fear .
'I do not wish to offend , ' his every look seemed to say , ' I only wish to save myself , but I do not know how . ' 
They talked about their mutual friends , carrying on a most unimportant conversation , but it seemed to Kitty that every word they said was deciding their and her fate .
A mist came over the ball and the whole world in Kitty 's soul .
Only the thorough training she had had enabled and obliged her to do what was expected of her , that is , to dance , to answer the questions put to her , to talk , and even to smile .
But before the mazurka began , when the chairs were already being placed for it , and several couples moved from the small to the large ball @-@ room , Kitty was for a moment seized with despair .
She must tell her mother that she was feeling ill , and go home , but she had not the strength to do it .
But although she seemed like a butterfly just settled on a blade of grass and ready at any moment to flutter and spread its rainbow wings , her heart was crushed with terrible despair .
'But perhaps I am mistaken , perhaps it was nothing of the kind ? '
And she again recalled all that she had witnessed .
'Kitty , what does this mean ? ' asked the Countess Nordston , coming up inaudibly over the carpet . ' I don 't understand it . ' 
'No , no , ' said Kitty in a voice tremulous with tears .
The Countess Nordston , who was engaged to Korsunsky for the mazurka , told him to ask Kitty instead .
Kitty danced in the first pair , and luckily for her she was not obliged to talk , because Korsunsky ran about all the time giving orders in his domain .
Vronsky and Anna sat almost opposite to her .
And she saw them with her far @-@ sighted eyes , she saw them close by , too ; when they met in the dance , and the more she saw of them the surer she was that the blow had fallen .
She saw that they felt as if they were alone in that crowded ball @-@ room .
On Vronsky 's face , usually so firm and self @-@ possessed she noticed that expression of bewilderment and submission which had so surprised her - an expression like that of an intelligent dog when it feels guilty .
Anna smiled - and the smile passed on to him ; she became thoughtful - and he became serious .
Some supernatural power attracted Kitty 's eyes to Anna 's face .
Kitty admired her even more than before , and suffered more and more .
She felt herself crushed and her face expressed it .
When Vronsky happened to knock against her as they danced , he did not at once recognize her , so changed was she .
'A delightful ball , ' he remarked , in order to say something .
In the middle of the mazurka , performing a complicated figure newly @-@ invented by Korsunsky , Anna stepped into the middle of the room and chose two men and two ladies , one of whom was Kitty , to join her .
'Yes , there is something strange , satanic , and enchanting about her , ' thought Kitty .
'Come , Anna Arkadyevna , ' began Korsunsky , drawing her bare arm under his , ' I have such a good idea for a cotillion - Un bijou . ' 
And he moved slowly on , trying to draw her with him .
Their host smiled approvingly .
'So you really are going to @-@ morrow ? ' said Vronsky .
'Yes , I think so , ' Anna replied as if surprised at the boldness of his question ; but the uncontrollable radiance of her eyes and her smile burnt him as she spoke the words .
Anna did not stay for supper , but went away .
'YES , THERE IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING OBJECTIONABLE and repellent about me , ' thought Levin after leaving the Shcherbatskys , as he walked toward his brother 's lodgings . ' I do not get on with other people .
They say it is pride !
No , I am not even proud .
If I had any pride , I should not have put myself into such a position . ' 
And he pictured to himself Vronsky , happy , kind , clever , calm , and certainly never placing himself in such a terrible position as he , Levin , had been in that evening .
'Yes , she was bound to choose him .
It had to be so , and I have no cause to complain of anyone or anything .
It was my own fault .
What right had I to imagine that she would wish to unite her life with mine ?
And he remembered his brother Nicholas , and kept his mind gladly on that memory .
Of course , from Prokofy 's point of view , who saw him in a ragged coat and tipsy , he is a despicable fellow ; but I know him from another side .
I know his soul , and know that we resemble one another .
And yet I , instead of looking him up , dined out and came here . ' 
Levin went up to a lamp @-@ post and read his brother 's address which he had in his pocket @-@ book , and then hired a sledge .
On the long way to his brother 's he recalled all the events he knew of Nicholas 's life .
He remembered how his brother had brought a boy from the country to educate , and in a fit of anger had so beaten the lad that proceedings were commenced against him for causing bodily harm .
He remembered an affair with a sharper to whom his brother had lost money , and whom he had first given a promissory note and then prosecuted on a charge of fraud .
( That was when his brother Sergius had paid the money for him . )
It was all very disgusting , but to Levin it did not seem nearly so disgusting as it must have seemed to those who did not know Nicholas , nor his whole story , nor his heart .
He was teased and called ' Noah ' and ' monk , ' and then when he broke loose no one helped him , but all turned away from him with horror and disgust .
Levin felt that his brother Nicholas , in his soul , in the innermost depths of his soul , despite the depravity of his life , was no worse than those who despised him .
It was not his fault that he was born with his ungovernable temper , and with a cramped mind .
He always wished to do right .
'I will tell him everything , I will get him to tell me everything . I will show him that I love and therefore understand him , ' Levin decided in his mind , as toward eleven o 'clock he drove up to the hotel of which he had the address .
'Upstairs , Nos. I2 and I3 , ' said the hall porter in reply to Levin 's question .
As he entered the doorway the stranger 's voice was saying :
'It all depends on how intelligently and rationally the affair is conducted . ' 
He could not see his brother , and his heart sank painfully at the thought that Nicholas lived among such strange people .
No one noticed him , and , as he took off his goloshes , he overheard what the man in the workman 's coat was saying .
'Oh , let the privileged classes go to the devil , ' said his brother 's voice , with a cough .
'Masha , get us some supper and bring the wine if any is left , or send for some . ' 
'Here is a gentleman , Nicholas Dmitrich , ' she said .
'Whom do you want ? ' said Nicholas Levin 's voice angrily .
'It is I , ' answered Constantine Levin , coming forward into the lamp @-@ light .
'Who 's I ? ' said the voice of Nicholas Levin still more angrily .
He was even more emaciated than three years before when Constantine Levin had last seen him .
He was wearing a short coat , and his hands and broad bones appeared more immense than ever .
His hair was thinner but the same straight moustache covered his lips ; and the same eyes with their peculiar , naive gaze looked out at the new @-@ comer .
'Ah ! Kostya ! ' he said suddenly , recognizing his brother , and his eyes lit up with joy .
'I wrote both to you and to Sergius Ivanich that I do not know you and do not wish to know you .
What is it ? What do you want ? '
He was not at all as Constantine had imagined him .
'I do not want anything of you specially , ' he answered meekly ; ' I have simply come to see you . ' 
His brother 's timidity obviously softened Nicholas , whose lips quivered .
'Ah ! You have come just for that ? ' he said .
No , wait a little .
Do you know who this is ? ' he added , turning to his brother and pointing to the man in the workman 's coat . ' It is Mr. Kritsky , my friend ever since my Kiev days , a very remarkable fellow .
Of course the police are after him , because he is not a scoundrel . ' 
And he glanced round at everybody present as was his way .
'You were at Kiev University ? ' Constantine Levin asked Kritsky , in order to break the awkward silence that followed .
'Yes , at Kiev , ' Kritsky replied with an angry frown .
So now you know whom you have to deal with , and if you fear you will be degraded - there is the door . ' 
And again his eyes glanced questioningly around .
'Why should I be degraded ? I don 't understand . ' 
'Well , Masha , order supper for three , with vodka and wine ...
No , wait .
'SO YOU SEE ... ' NICHOLAS LEVIN CONTINUED with an effort , wrinkling his brow and twitching .
He kept glancing at his brother 's sickly , consumptive face , and felt more and more sorry for him , nor could he force himself to pay attention to what Nicholas was telling him about the Association .
He realized that this Association was merely an anchor to save his brother from self @-@ contempt .
All the profits on their labour , by which they might better their condition , give themselves some leisure , and consequently gain some education , all this surplus value is taken away by the capitalists .
And our society has so shaped itself that the more the people work the richer the merchants and landowners will become , while the people will remain beasts of burden for ever .
And this system must be changed , ' he concluded , with an inquiring look at his brother .
'Yes , of course , ' said Constantine , looking intently at the hectic flush which had appeared on his brother 's face below its prominent cheek bones .
'And so we are starting a Locksmiths ' Association , in which all the products and the profits and , above all , the instruments of production will be common property . ' 
'Where will the business be ? ' asked Constantine .
Why start a Locksmiths ' Association there ? '
Constantine sighed and at the same time looked round the room which was dismal and dirty .
The sigh seemed to irritate Nicholas still more .
'I know your aristocratic outlook and Sergius Ivanich 's .
I know that he uses all the powers of his mind to justify the existing evils . ' 
'But why talk about Sergius Ivanich ? ' said Levin with a smile .
This is why ! ' suddenly shouted Nicholas at the mention of the name . ' This is why .
One thing only ...
Why have you come here ?
You despise it , well , that is all right - then go away . Go , go in God 's name ! ' he exclaimed , rising from his chair .
'I do not despise it at all , ' Constantine replied meekly . ' I do not even dispute it . ' 
Meanwhile Mary Nikolavna had come back .
Nicholas gave her an angry look .
'I am not well and have grown irritable , ' said Nicholas , breathing heavily and quieting down . ' And you talk to me about Sergius Ivanich and his article .
It is such rubbish , such humbug , such self @-@ deception .
What can a man write about justice , who does not understand it ? '
'Have you read his article ? ' he said , turning to Kritsky again , sitting down to the table and clearing away from it a heap of half @-@ filled cigarettes to make room .
'I have not read it , ' said Kritsky morosely , evidently not wishing to join in the conversation .
'Why not ? ' irritably answered Nicholas , still addressing Kritsky .
'Because I consider it unnecessary to waste time on it . ' 
'What do you mean ? May I ask how you knew it would waste your time ?
That article is incomprehensible to many ; I mean it is above them .
But it is a different matter with me . I see through his thought , and therefore know why it is weak . ' 
Kritsky rose and took up his hat .
'Don 't you want any supper ?
As soon as Kritsky had gone out , Nicholas smiled and winked .
But at that moment Kritsky called him from outside the door .
'What do you want now ? ' said Nicholas and went out into the passage .
Left alone with Mary Nikolavna , Levin spoke to her .
'Have you been long with my brother ? ' he asked .
'Yes , it is the second year now .
His health is very bad , he drinks too much , ' she said .
'Really - what does he drink ? '
'Yes , ' she said looking timidly toward the door , just as Nicholas returned .
'What were you talking about ? ' he asked frowning and looking from one to the other with frightened eyes . ' What was it ? '
'Nothing , ' replied Levin in confusion .
Only you have no business to talk to her .
'Nicholas Dmitrich , Nicholas Dmitrich , ' whispered Mary Nikolavna , again approaching him .
Come , have a drink .
Tell me what you are doing , ' he continued , greedily chewing a crust of bread and filling himself another glass . ' How are you getting on ? '
'I am living alone in the country , as I did before , and I look after the farming , ' answered Constantine , observing with horror how greedily his brother ate and drank , and trying not to let it be seen that he noticed it .
'Why don 't you get married ? '
'I had not the chance , ' replied Constantine blushing .
'Why not ?
I have spoilt my life .
I have said , and still say , that if I had been given my share of the property when I wanted it , everything would have been different . ' 
Constantine hastened to change the subject .
'Do you know that your Vanyusha is now a clerk in my office at Pokrovsk ? ' he said .
Nicholas jerked his head and grew thoughtful .
'Yes , tell me what is happening in Pokrovsk Is the house still standing , and the birch trees , and our schoolroom ?
And is Philip the gardener really still living ?
Mind , don 't change anything in the house , but get married soon and set things going again as they used to be .
Then I will come to you if you have a good wife . ' 
'Come to me at once , ' said Levin . ' How well we might settle down there ! '
'I would come if I were sure I should not find Sergius Ivanich there . ' 
'You won 't find him there .
I live quite apart from him . ' 
'Still , say what you will , you must choose between him and me , ' said Nicholas with a timid look at his brother .
'If you want my full confession about it , I will tell you that I take no side in your quarrel with Sergius Ivanich .
You are both to blame : You more in external matters and he more in essential ones . ' 
Then you have grasped it , you have grasped it ? ' joyfully exclaimed Nicholas .
'But personally , if you care to know it , I value your friendship more because ... '
Constantine could not tell him that it was because Nicholas was unfortunate and needed friendship .
But Nicholas understood that he meant just that , and frowning , again took hold of the vodka bottle .
Leave me alone !
I 'll thrash you ! ' shouted he .
Mary Nikolavna gave a mild , kindly smile , which evoked one from Nicholas , and she took away the bottle .
'Do you think she doesn 't understand ? ' said Nicholas . ' She understands it all better than any of us .
There really is something good and sweet about her . ' 
'You were never in Moscow before ? ' Constantine asked very politely , just in order to say something .
'Don 't speak to her in that way .
It frightens her .
And he began to relate all his encounters with these new institutions .
Constantine Levin listened to him , and the condemnation of the social institutions , which he shared with him and had often expressed , was unpleasant to him when he heard it from his brother 's lips .
'We shall understand it better in the next world , ' he said playfully .
Would you like some champagne ?
His speech began to grow confused and he jumped from one subject to another .
Masha promised to write to Constantine in case of need , and to try to persuade Nicholas to go and live with him .
NEXT MORNING CONSTANTINE LEVIN LEFT MOSCOW and toward evening he reached home .
He felt that he was himself and did not wish to be anyone else .
He only wished now to be better than he had been formerly .
Secondly , he would never again allow himself to be carried away by passion , the repulsive memory of which had so tormented him when he was making up his mind to propose .
And he felt that that would be soon .
Then his brother 's talk about communism , which he had taken lightly at the time , now made him think .
A light fell on the snow @-@ covered space in front of the house from the windows of the room of his old nurse Agatha Mikhaylovna , who now acted as his housekeeper .
Laska , a setter bitch , ran out too , almost throwing Kuzma off his feet , and whined and rubbed herself against Levin 's knees , jumping up and wishing but not daring to put her front paws on his chest .
When he saw all this , he was overcome by a momentary doubt of the possibility of starting the new life of which he had been dreaming on his way .
That was what the things said , but another voice within his soul was saying that one must not submit to the past and that one can do anything with oneself .
And obeying the latter voice he went to the corner where two thirty @-@ six pound dumb @-@ bells lay and began doing gymnastic exercises with them to invigorate himself .
His steward entered and said that , ' the Lord be thanked , ' everything was all right , but that the buckwheat had burned in the new drying kiln .
This news irritated Levin .
The new kiln had been built and partly invented by him .
The steward had always been against the new kiln , and now proclaimed with suppressed triumph that the buckwheat had got burnt .
Levin felt quite certain that if it had been burnt it was only because the precautions about which he had given instructions over and over again had been neglected .
He was vexed , and he reprimanded the steward .
Crossing the yard past the heap of snow by the lilac bush , he reached the shed .
There was a warm steaming smell of manure when the frozen door opened , and the cows , astonished at the unaccustomed light of the lantern , began moving on their clean straw .
The calf fumbled about , pushing its nose under its mother 's belly and swinging its little tail .
'Show a light here , Theodore , here , ' said Levin , examining the calf .
Vasily Fedorich , isn 't she fine ? ' he said , turning to the steward , and quite forgiving him for the buckwheat under the influence of his satisfaction about the calf .
Simon the contractor , came the day after you left .
We shall have to employ him , Constantine Dmitrich , ' said the steward . ' I told you about the machine . ' 
IT WAS A LARGE OLD @-@ FASHIONED HOUSE , and though only Levin was living in it , he used and heated the whole of it .
He knew this to be foolish and even wrong , and contrary to his new plans , but this house was a whole world to Levin .
It was the world in which his father and mother had lived and died .
They had lived a life which appeared to him ideally perfect , and which he had dreamed of renewing with a wife and family of his own .
Levin could scarcely remember his mother .
His conception of her was to him a sacred memory , and in his imagination his future wife was to be a repetition of the enchanting and holy ideal of womanhood that his mother had been .
He could not imagine the love of woman without marriage , and even pictured to himself a family first and then the woman who would give him the family .
And now he had to renounce it .
With her , or with another , they would come true .
He felt that in the depth of his soul something was settling down , adjusting and composing itself .
It was a book of Tyndall 's on heat .
He recalled his disapproval of Tyndall 's self @-@ conceit concerning the cleverness of his experiments and his lack of a philosophic outlook .
'Well , let us grant that electricity and heat are one and the same , but can we substitute the one quantity for the other in solving an equation ?
It will be especially good when Pava 's calf is already a red @-@ mottled cow , and the whole herd in which these three will be ... !
My wife will say : " We , Constantine and I , reared this calf like a baby . "
" All that interests him interests me .. "
'Well , what is to be done ? ...
But now everything will be on new lines .
It is nonsense to say that life will prevent it , that the past prevents it .
I must struggle to live a better , a far better , life . ' 
'She all but speaks , ' said Agatha Mikhaylovna .
'Why depressed ? '
Levin looked at her intently , surprised that she knew so well what was in his mind .
'Shall I bring you a little more tea ? ' she said and went out with his cup .
Laska kept on pushing her head under his hand .
He patted her a little , and she curled herself up at his feet with her head on her outstretched hind paw .
And to show that all was now well and satisfactory , she slightly opened her mouth , smacked her sticky lips , and drawing them more closely over her old teeth lay still in blissful peace .
Levin attentively watched this last movement of hers .
EARLY IN THE MORNING after the ball Anna sent a telegram to her husband to say that she was leaving Moscow that same evening .
Stephen Oblonsky was not dining at home , but promised to be back at seven to see his sister off .
Dolly and Anna dined alone with the children and their English governess .
Anna spent the whole morning preparing for her departure : writing notes to her Moscow acquaintances , making up accounts , and packing .
After dinner Anna went to her room to dress and Dolly followed her .
'How strange you are to @-@ day ! ' said Dolly
'I ? Do you think so ?
I am not strange , but wicked .
It sometimes happens to me .
I feel ready to cry .
It is very silly , but it will pass , ' said Anna hurriedly , and she bent her flushed face over the tiny bag into which she was packing a night @-@ cap and some lawn handkerchiefs .
Her eyes shone peculiarly and kept filling with tears . ' I did not want to leave Petersburg , and now I do not want to leave here . ' 
'You came here and did a good action , ' said Dolly , scrutinizing her attentively .
'Do not say that , Dolly .
I have done and could do nothing .
I often wonder why people conspire to spoil me .
What have I done and what could I do ?
There was enough love in your heart to forgive ... '
'But for you , God only knows what would have happened !
How lucky you are , Anna , ' said Dolly . ' Everything in your soul is clear and good . ' 
'Every one has a skeleton in their cupboard , as the English say . ' 
'What skeleton have you ?
Everything about you is so clear . ' 
'I have one ! ' said Anna , and unexpectedly following her tears , a sly , humorous smile puckered her lips .
And to her surprise Dolly saw that Anna was blushing to her ears and to the curly black locks on her neck .
'Do you know , ' continued Anna , ' why Kitty did not come to dinner ?
I have spoiled ... I mean I was the cause of the ball being a torture instead of a pleasure to her .
'Oh , how like Steve you said that , ' remarked Dolly laughing .
Anna was annoyed .
'Oh no , no , I am not Steve , ' she said frowning . ' The reason I have told you is that I do not even for a moment allow myself to distrust myself . ' 
'You cannot think how queerly it came about .
Perhaps against my own will I ... '
She blushed and stopped .
'Oh , they feel that at once ! ' said Dolly .
'But I should be in despair if there were anything serious in it on his side , ' Anna interrupted her . ' I am sure that it will all be forgotten , and Kitty will no longer hate me . ' 
Oh , what a darling she is !
But you will put it right ?
Dolly could hardly repress a smile .
She was fond of Anna , but it was pleasant to find that she too had a weakness .
That is impossible . ' 
She dabbed her face with her handkerchief , and began to dress .
Oblonsky , smelling of wine and cigars , with his face red and happy , came in late , just as she was about to start .
Anna 's emotion had spread to Dolly , who as she embraced her sister @-@ in @-@ law for the last time whispered :
'I do not know why you should , ' said Anna , kissing her and trying to hide her tears .
'You understood and understand me .
She sat down beside her maid Annushka , and peered round the dimly @-@ lit sleeping compartment .
'Thank Heaven , to @-@ morrow I shall see Serezha and Alexis Alexandrovich again , and my good accustomed life will go on as of old . ' 
At first she could not read .
Annushka was already dozing , her broad hands , with a hole in one of the gloves , holding the red bag on her lap .
Anna read and understood , but it was unpleasant to read , that is to say , to follow the reflection of other people 's lives .
She was too eager to live herself .
But there was nothing to be done , so she forced herself to read , while her little hand toyed with the smooth paper @-@ knife .
'What am I ashamed of ? ' she asked herself with indignant surprise .
She put down her book , leaned back , and clasped the paper @-@ knife tightly in both hands .
They were all good and pleasant .
She recalled the ball and Vronsky and his humble , enamoured gaze , and their relations with one another ; there was nothing to be ashamed of .
'Well , what of it ? ' she finally said to herself with decision , changing her position on the seat . ' What does it signify ?
What of it ?
Just as if there existed , or could exist , between me and this officer @-@ lad any relations differing from those with other acquaintances . ' 
She smiled disdainfully and again took up her book ; but now she absolutely could not understand what she was reading .
She passed her paper @-@ knife over the windowpane , then pressed its cold smooth surface against her cheek and almost laughed aloud , suddenly overcome with unreasoning joy .
She felt that her nerves were being stretched like strings drawn tighter and tighter round pegs .
Was it Annushka who was sitting beside her , or a stranger ?
'And am I here , myself ?
Something seemed to draw her to them , but she had the power to give way to them or to resist .
To get over it she rose , threw off her wrap , and took off the cape of her coat .
But all this did not seem dreadful , but amusing .
The voice of a man wrapped up and covered with snow shouted something just above her ear .
She rose and came to herself , understanding that they had stopped at a station and that this was the guard .
She asked Annushka to give her the cape she had removed and a shawl , and putting them on she moved to the door .
'Are you going out ? ' asked Annushka .
'Yes , I want a breath of air .
She opened the carriage door .
The snow and wind rushed toward her and had a tussle with her for the door .
And this too struck her as amusing .
She went out .
With enjoyment she drew in full breaths of the snowy , frosty air as she stood beside her carriage looking round at the platform and the lighted station .
A BLUSTERING STORM WAS RUSHING and whistling between the wheels of the train and round the pillars and the corners of the station .
The railway carriages , the pillars , the people , and everything that could be seen , were covered on one side with snow , and that covering became thicker and thicker .
A momentary lull would be followed by such a terrific gust that it seemed hardly possible to stand against it .
Yet people , merrily exchanging remarks , ran over the creaking boards of the platform , and the big station doors were constantly being opened and shut .
The shadow of a man stooping slipped past her feet and she heard a hammer striking the carriage wheels .
'Let me have the telegram ! ' came an angry voice from the other side out of the stormy darkness .
'Here , please , No. 28 ! ' cried other voices , while many people muffled up and covered with snow ran hither and thither .
With his hand in salute , he bowed and asked if she wanted anything and whether he could be of any service to her .
For some time she looked into his face without answering , and , though he stood in the shade she noticed , or thought she noticed , the expression of his face and eyes .
It was the same expression of respectful ecstasy that had so affected her the night before .
There was no need for her to ask him why he was there .
She knew as well as if he had told her , that he was there in order to be where she was .
Why are you going ? ' she asked , dropping the hand with which she was about to take hold of the handrail .
Her face beamed with a joy and animation she could not repress .
'Why am I going ? ' he repeated , looking straight into her eyes . ' You know that I am going in order to be where you are , ' said he . ' I cannot do otherwise . ' 
The awfulness of the storm appeared still more beautiful to her now .
He had said just what , her soul desired but her reason dreaded .
He spoke courteously and respectfully , but so firmly and stubbornly that she was long unable to reply .
'What you are saying is wrong , and if you are a good man , I beg you to forget it , as I will forget it , ' she said at last .
'Not a word , not a movement of yours will I ever forget , nor can I ... '
'Enough , enough ! ' she cried , vainly trying to give a severe expression to her face , into which he was gazing eagerly .
She took hold of the cold handrail , ascended the steps , and quickly entered the little lobby leading into the carriage .
But in that little lobby she stopped , going over in her imagination what had just taken place .
Though she could remember neither his nor her own words , she instinctively felt that that momentary conversation had drawn them terribly near to one another , and this both frightened her and made her happy .
After standing still for a few seconds she went into the carriage and sat down .
The overwrought condition which tormented her before not only returned again , but grew worse and reached such a degree that she feared every moment that something within her would give way under the intolerable strain .
She did not sleep at all that night , but the strain and the visions which filled her imagination had nothing unpleasant or dismal about them ; on the contrary they seemed joyful , glowing , and stimulating .
Toward morning Anna , while still sitting up , fell into a doze ; when she woke it was already light and the train was approaching Petersburg .
At once thoughts of home , her husband , her son , and the cares of the coming day and of those that would follow , beset her .
When the train stopped at the Petersburg terminus and she got out , the first face she noticed was that of her husband .
When he saw her , he came toward her with his customary ironical smile and looked straight at her with his large tired eyes .
An unpleasant feeling weighed on her heart when she felt his fixed and weary gaze , as if she had expected to find him different .
She was particularly struck by the feeling of dissatisfaction with herself which she experienced when she met him .
It was that ordinary well @-@ known feeling , as if she were dissembling , which she experienced in regard to her husband , but formerly she had not noticed it , while now she was clearly and painfully conscious of it .
'And is this all the reward I get , ' he said , ' for my ardour ?
VRONSKY DID NOT EVEN TRY TO SLEEP that night .
He looked at people as if they were inanimate things .
A nervous young man , a Law Court official , who sat opposite , hated him for that look .
Vronsky neither saw nor heard anyone .
He felt himself a king , not because he believed that he had made an impression on Anna - he did not yet believe that - but because the impression she had made on him filled him with happiness and pride .
What would come of it all he did not know and did not even consider .
He felt that all his powers , hitherto dissipated and scattered , were now concentrated and directed with terrible energy toward one blissful aim .
This made him happy .
He knew only that he had told her the truth : that he would go where she went , that all the happiness of life and the only meaning of life for him now was in seeing and hearing her .
When he had got out of the train at Bologoe station to drink a glass of seltzer water and had seen Anna , he had involuntarily at once told her just what he was thinking about it .
He was glad he had said it to her , and that she now knew it and was thinking about it .
He did not sleep at all that night .
When he returned to the train , he kept recalling all the positions in which he had seen her , and all her words ; and in his imagination , causing his heart to stand still , floated pictures of a possible future .
When he got out of the train at Petersburg he felt , despite his sleepless night , as fresh and animated as after a cold bath .
He stopped outside the carriage , waiting till she appeared .
'I shall see her again , ' he thought and smiled involuntarily . ' I shall see her walk , her face ... she will say something , turn her head , look at me , perhaps even smile . ' 
But before seeing her he saw her husband , whom the station @-@ master was respectfully conducting through the crowd .
Only now did Vronsky for the first time clearly realize that the husband was connected with her .
Karenin 's gait , the swinging of his thighs , and his wide short feet , particularly offended Vronsky , who acknowledged only his own unquestionable right to love Anna .
But she was still the same , and the sight of her still affected him physically , exhilarating and stimulating him and filling him with joy .
He saw the husband and wife meet , and with the penetration of a lover he noticed the signs of slight embarrassment when she spoke to her husband .
'No , she doesn 't and can 't love him , ' he decided mentally .
While he was approaching her from behind he observed with joy that she became aware of his approach and was about to turn but , on recognizing him , again addressed her husband .
'Yes , quite comfortable , thank you , ' she replied .
Karenin looked at him with displeasure , absently trying to recall who he might be .
Vronsky 's calm self @-@ confidence struck like a scythe on a stone against the cold self @-@ confidence of Karenin .
'Count Vronsky , ' said Anna .
By addressing himself thus to his wife he conveyed to Vronsky his wish to be alone with her , and turning to Vronsky he touched his hat . But Vronsky , addressing Anna , said :
'I hope to have the honour of calling on you . ' 
Karenin glanced at him with his weary eyes .
'You insist too much on your devotion , for me to value it greatly , ' she replied in the same playful tone , while she involuntarily listened to the sound of Vronsky 's footsteps following them .
'But what does he matter to me ? ' she asked herself , and began inquiring of her husband how Serezha had got on during her absence .
Mariette says he was very sweet . But - I 'm sorry to grieve you ! - he did not fret after you ... like your husband ! ...
Our dear samovar will be in ecstasies . ' 
( He called the celebrated Countess Lydia Ivanovna samovar because she was always getting heated and boiling over about something . )
And , do you know , if I may advise , you should go and see her to @-@ day .
Her heart is always aching about somebody .
Countess Lydia Ivanovna was Anna 's husband 's friend and the centre of that set in Petersburg Society with which Anna , through her husband , was most closely connected .
'But I wrote to her . ' 
'Yes , but she wants the particulars .
Now I shan 't have to dine alone , ' he went on , no longer in a bantering manner . ' You can 't think how I used ... '
and with a long pressure of her hand and a special kind of smile he helped her into the carriage .
THE FIRST PERSON TO MEET ANNA when she reached home was her son .
He ran down the stairs to her regardless of his governess 's cries , and with desperate delight called out : ' Mama ! Mama ! '
When he reached her he clung round her neck .
'I told you it was Mama ! ' he shouted to the governess .
'I knew ! ' Her son , like his father , produced on Anna a feeling akin to disappointment .
Her fancy had pictured him nicer than he was in reality .
She had to come down to reality in order to enjoy him as he was .
But even as he was , he was charming , with his fair curls , blue eyes and plump shapely legs in tight @-@ fitting stockings .
Anna experienced an almost physical pleasure in feeling his proximity and his caresses , and a moral solace when she met his simple , trustful , and loving gaze and heard his naive questions .
She unpacked the presents which Dolly 's children had sent him , and told him that there was a girl in Moscow whose name was Tanya , who could read and even teach other children .
'And am I worse than she ? ' asked Serezha .
'I know , ' he said , smiling .
Before Anna had time to finish her coffee the Countess Lydia Ivanovna was announced .
The Countess was a tall , stout woman with a sickly sallow complexion and beautiful , dreamy , black eyes .
Anna was fond of her , but to @-@ day she seemed to see her for the first time with all her defects .
'Well , my dear ! did you take the olive branch ? ' asked the Countess Lydia Ivanovna as soon as she entered the room .
'Yes , it 's all over ; but the whole affair was not as serious as we thought , ' Anna replied . ' My sister @-@ in @-@ law is , in general , too impulsive . ' 
But the Countess , who was interested in everything that did not concern her , had a habit of never listening to what interested her , and she interrupted Anna :
'Why ! What is the matter ? ' asked Anna , trying to suppress a smile .
'I am getting tired of breaking lances uselessly in the cause of truth , and sometimes I feel quite unstrung .
Two or three , your husband among them , understand the full significance of the affair , but the others just drop it .
Pravdin was a well @-@ known Panslavist who resided abroad . The Countess told Anna what he had written .
'This is all just as it was before , but how is it that I never noticed it before ? ' said Anna to herself . ' Or is it that she is specially irritated this morning ?
But it is really funny ; her aim is to do good , she is a Christian and yet she is always angry and always has enemies - all on account of Christianity and philanthropy ! '
After the Countess had left , a friend - a high official 's wife - arrived and gave Anna all the Petersburg news .
At three she also left , promising to come back to dinner .
Karenin was at the Ministry .
The feeling of causeless shame she had felt during the journey , and her agitation , had quite vanished .
In her accustomed conditions of life she again felt firm and blameless .
'What had happened ?
Nothing !
Vronsky said some silly things , to which it will be easy to put a stop , and I said what was necessary .
It is unnecessary and impossible to speak of it to my husband .
To speak of it would be to give it an importance that does not belong to it . ' 
'So there is no need to tell him !
Besides ; thank Heaven there is nothing to tell ! ' she said to herself .
KARENIN RETURNED FROM THE MINISTRY at four o 'clock , but , as often happened , he had no time to go up and see his wife .
He went straight to his study to receive some petitioners and sign a few documents brought by his private secretary .
Anna went into the drawing @-@ room to entertain them .
Every moment of his life was filled up and apportioned , and in order to find time to perform all the tasks allotted to each day he observed the strictest regularity .
'Without haste and without rest , ' was his motto .
He entered the room , greeted everybody , and quickly sat down , smiling at his wife .
'So my solitude has come to an end .
At dinner he spoke a little about Moscow affairs with his wife , asking with an ironical smile after Stephen Oblonsky ; but for the most part the conversation was general and dealt with Petersburg service and social affairs .
After dinner he spent half an hour with his guests , and then , having again with a smile pressed his wife 's hand , went away to the Council .
That evening Anna went neither to see the Princess Betsy Tverskaya , who having heard of Anna 's return had invited her , nor to the theatre , where she had a box for that evening .
Her chief reason for not going was that a dress on which she had counted was not ready .
Before going to Moscow , she - being an adept at dressing on comparatively little money - left three dresses to be altered .
The dressmaker came to explain that it was better as she had done it , and Anna lost her temper to such a degree that she afterwards felt ashamed .
She sat down by the fire with an English novel and awaited her husband .
Exactly at half @-@ past nine there was a ring at the front door , and he entered the room .
'In general , I see that your journey has been a success , ' said he .
'Yes , quite , ' she replied , and related everything that had happened from the beginning : her journey with the Countess Vronskaya , her arrival , the accident at the railway station .
'I don 't think that one can excuse such a man , even though he is your brother , ' remarked Karenin , severely .
She knew he had said that in order to show that no consideration of kinship could hinder the expression of his sincere opinion .
She knew that trait in her husband 's character , knew and liked it .
'I am glad it has all ended satisfactorily and that you are back again , ' he continued . ' But what are they saying there about the new Statute I carried in the Council ? '
Anna had heard nothing about the Statute , and felt ashamed that she had so lightly forgotten what was of such importance to him .
'Here , on the contrary , it has made quite a stir , ' he said with a self @-@ satisfied smile .
Anna saw that he wanted to tell her something pleasant to himself about that affair , and by questioning she led him on to tell her all about it .
With the same self @-@ satisfied smile he told her about the ovations he had received on account of the enactment of that Statute .
'I was very , very pleased .
It shows that at last a clear and reasonable view of the matter is beginning to be firmly held among us . ' 
Having finished his second cup of tea and cream and his bread and butter , he rose and went into his study .
'And have you not been out anywhere ? You must have been dull , ' he said .
'Oh no ! ' she answered , rising and following him through the room to his study . ' And what are you reading now ? ' she asked .
'I am now reading the Duc de Lille 's Poésie des enfers , he replied . ' A very remarkable book . ' 
Anna smiled , as one smiles at the weaknesses of people one loves , and slipping her hand under his arm walked with him to the study door .
She knew that in spite of his time being almost entirely absorbed by the duties of his post , he considered it incumbent on him to follow everything of importance that appeared in the world of thought .
He liked talking of Shakespeare , Raphael and Beethoven , and about the importance of the new schools of poetry and music , which in his mind were all classified with very logical exactitude .
He pressed her hand and again kissed it .
'It 's time ! It 's time ! ' said he with a peculiar smile , going into their bedroom .
'And what right had he to look at him as he did ? ' thought Anna , remembering how Vronsky had looked at Karenin .
WHEN HE WENT TO Moscow , Vronsky had left his large flat on the Morskaya to his friend and favourite comrade , Petritsky .
Arriving home from the station about noon , Vronsky recognized a hired brougham at the front door .
When he rang the bell , while still outside , he heard men 's laughter , a woman 's lisping voice , and Petritsky shouting : ' If it is one of the villains , don 't let him in ! '
Vronsky told the servants not to announce his arrival , and softly entered the first room .
Petritsky 's friend , the Baroness Chilton , her lilac satin dress and pink and white face glistening , and like a canary filling the whole room with her Parisian voice , was seated at the round table making coffee .
Petritsky in his great coat , and Captain Kamerovsky in full uniform probably straight from parade , sat on each side of her .
Bravo ! ' exclaimed Petritsky jumping up and noisily pushing back his chair . ' The master himself !
I hope you are pleased with this ornament to your study , ' he added , pointing to the Baroness . ' Of course , you know one another ? '
'I should think so ! ' replied Vronsky with a merry smile , as he pressed the Baroness 's small hand . ' Of course : quite old friends . ' 
'You have returned from a journey ? ' said the Baroness .
'You are at home where you are , Baroness , ' said Vronsky . ' How do you do , Kamerovsky ? ' he added , coldly shaking hands with the Captain .
'There now ! You never manage to say such pretty things , ' said the Baroness to Petritsky .
'Oh yes ! Why not ?
And your wife ? ' the Baroness said suddenly , interrupting Vronsky 's conversation with his comrade . ' We here have been marrying you off !
And the Baroness , instead of releasing Vronsky , began telling him her plans for the future , interspersing jokes and asking his advice .
'He won 't agree to a divorce !
Whatever am I to do ? '
'I want to begin an action .
What would you advise ?
Kamerovsky , mind the coffee , it 's boiling over ! Don 't you see I am occupied ? ...
I want to bring an action because I need my property .
You see how absurd it is , that because I am supposed to be unfaithful , ' she said contemptuously , ' he wishes to have the use of my property . ' 
Vronsky listened with pleasure to the merry prattle of the pretty young woman , agreed with what she said , and half in fun gave her advice ; in a word he immediately took up his habitual manner with women of her kind .
In his Petersburg world people were divided into two quite opposite sorts .
These were the old @-@ fashioned and ridiculous people .
The coffee never got made , but boiled over and splashed everybody , effecting just what was required : that is , it gave an excuse for much noise and laughter , staining the valuable carpet and the Baroness 's dress .
'Now good @-@ bye , or you 'll never get washed , and on my conscience will lie the greatest crime of a gentleman - want of cleanliness ...
'Most certainly , and hold it so that your hand will be near his lips .
He will kiss the hand and all will end well ! ' said Vronsky .
'Then we meet at the French Theatre to @-@ night ? ' and , her dress rustling , she vanished .
Kamerovsky rose also , and , without waiting for him to go , Vronsky shook hands with him and went to his dressing @-@ room .
While he was washing , Petritsky in a few words described his own position in so far as it had changed since Vronsky went away .
His tailor and another creditor were threatening him with arrest .
His C.O. had announced to him that if these scandals continued he ( Petritsky ) would have to resign .
He had also had a quarrel with Berkashev , who wished to send his seconds , but of course nothing would come of it .
But , in general , everything was first @-@ rate and extremely jolly ; and without letting his friend go into the details of his position Petritsky began telling him all the interesting news .
Listening to Petritsky 's familiar tales , in the familiar surroundings of the house he had lived in for three years , Vronsky experienced the satisfaction of returning to his customary careless Petersburg life .
'Oh , about Buzulukov there is such a tale - splendid ! ' shouted Petritsky . ' You know his passion for balls ?
He never misses a single Court ball .
'Yes , I am , ' replied Vronsky , rubbing himself with a bath @-@ towel .
'The Grand Duchess passed by with one of the Ambassadors , and as his ill @-@ luck would have it they were discussing the new helmets .
She sees our dear Buzulukov standing there ' - Petritsky imitated the pose ' the Grand Duchess asks him for his helmet , but he won 't let her have it !
No !
Just imagine it ! ...
That - what 's his name ? wishes to take it from him , but he won 't let go ...
" Here , this is one of the new ones , " says the Grand Duchess , turning it over , and - just fancy ! - out tumbles a pear and sweets - two pounds of them ! ...
Vronsky shook with laughter , and long after , when he was already talking of other things , he again went off into roars of hearty laughter , showing his compact row of strong teeth , at the remembrance of the helmet .
After that he intended to go to see his brother and to see Betsy , and to pay a few calls in order to begin visiting the set in which he could meet Anna Karenina .
As usual in Petersburg , he left the house not to return till late at night .
TOWARD THE END OF THE WINTER a consultation was held at the Shcherbatskys ' which was intended to ascertain the state of Kitty 's health and to decide what should be done to restore her failing strength .
She was ill , and with the approach of spring grew worse .
The celebrated specialist , a very handsome man and by no means old , insisted on sounding the invalid .
After having carefully examined and sounded the agitated invalid , who was stupefied with shame , the celebrity , having carefully washed his hands , stood in the drawing @-@ room talking to the Prince . The Prince frowned and coughed as he listened to the doctor .
The doctor meanwhile found it hard not to show his contempt for the old fellow , and with difficulty descended to the level of his comprehension .
He saw that it was waste of time to talk to him , and that the head in this house was the mother .
It was before her that he meant to spread his pearls .
Just then the Princess entered the room with the family doctor .
The Prince moved away , trying not to show how absurd he thought the whole farce .
The Princess was confused and did not know what to do .
'Then we had better leave you ? '
'As you please . ' 
When the doctors were alone , the family doctor began timidly to express his opinion , which was that a tuberculous process had begun , but ... etc .
The celebrity listened , but in the midst of the speech looked at his large gold watch .
'Yes , ' said he , ' but ... '
'We cannot , as you know , determine the beginning of a tuberculous process . As long as there are no cavities there is nothing definite to go by .
The question is this : When a tuberculous process is suspected , what should be done to nourish the patient ? '
'But you know in these cases there is always some hidden moral cause , ' the family doctor allowed himself to remark with a subtle smile .
We were saying that the question is this : How to nourish the patient and strengthen the nerves .
The two aims are connected , and we must act on both . ' 
You see , if a tuberculous process has begun ( which we don 't know ) , a journey abroad will not help the case .
And the celebrity explained his plan of a treatment with Soden Water , the chief reason for prescribing this evidently being that it could do no harm .
'But in favour of a journey abroad I should like to mention the change of habits , and the removal from surroundings which awaken memories .
Besides which , the mother wishes it , ' said he .
'Ah , in that case let them go , only those German quacks will do mischief ...
They must obey ...
However , let them go . ' 
The celebrity informed the Princess ( his sense of what was fitting suggested this to him ) that he would have to see the patient again .
'What , another examination ? ' exclaimed the mother , horror @-@ struck .
Her thin cheeks were flushed and her eyes were burning after the ordeal she had endured .
Her whole illness and the treatment appeared to her stupid and even ridiculous .
Her treatment seemed to her as absurd as piecing together the bits of a smashed vase .
Her heart was broken .
Why did they want to dose her with pills and powders ?
But she did not want to pain her mother , especially as her mother considered herself to blame .
'Sit down , please , Princess , ' said the celebrity .
He sat down opposite to her , smiling , felt her pulse and again began asking tiresome questions .
She answered him , but suddenly grew angry and rose .
You are asking me the same things three times over . ' 
The celebrity was not offended .
And to the Princess , as to an exceptionally intelligent woman , the doctor diagnosed Kitty 's condition in learned language , and concluded with directions how the unnecessary waters were to be drunk .
It was just as if something pleasant had happened when the doctor had gone , and Kitty too pretended to be cheerful .
She often now , almost always , had to pretend .
But if you wish to travel , let us go ! ' and trying to appear interested in the journey she began to talk about the preparations for it .
'Well , how is she ? ' she said , entering the drawing @-@ room without removing her bonnet .
They tried to tell her what the doctor had said , but it turned out that though he had spoken very fluently and at great length , it was impossible to reproduce what he had said .
The only thing of interest was that it had been decided they should go abroad .
Her relations with her husband after their reconciliation had become humiliating .
Anna 's soldering had not proved durable , and the family harmony had broken again at the same place .
There was nothing definite , but Oblonsky was hardly ever at home , there was hardly ever any money , and suspicions of his infidelity continually tormented Dolly , who tried to repel them , fearing the already familiar pangs of jealousy .
The first explosion of jealousy , once past , could not be repeated . Not even the discovery of an act of infidelity could again affect her as it had done the first time .
Such a discovery could now only deprive her of her accustomed family life , and she let herself be deceived , despising him , and especially herself , for such weakness .
Added to this the care of a large family worried her continually : either something went wrong with the feeding of the baby or the nurse left , or , as now , one of the children fell ill .
'And how are you all getting on ? ' asked her mother .
'Ah , Mama , we have plenty of trouble of our own .
Lily has fallen ill , and I 'm afraid it 's scarlet fever .
The old Prince came out of his study after the doctor had gone , and after giving his cheek to Dolly and greeting her he turned to his wife :
And what are you going to do with me ? '
'I think you should stay behind , Alexander , ' replied his wife .
'Mama , why should not Papa come with us ? ' said Kitty . ' It would be pleasanter for him and for us too . ' 
The old Prince rose and stroked Kitty 's hair .
She lifted her face and , forcing a smile , looked up at him .
She always felt that he understood her better than anyone else in the family , though he did not speak much to her .
Being the youngest she was his favourite , and it seemed to her that his affection gave him insight .
When her gaze now met his kindly blue eyes looking steadily at her , it seemed to her that he saw right through her , and knew all the trouble that was in her .
She bent toward him , blushing , and expecting a kiss , but he only patted her on the head and remarked :
'These stupid chignons !
One can 't get at one 's real daughter , but only caresses the hair of expired females .
Well , Dolly , ' he said , turning to his eldest daughter , ' and what is your prodigal about ? '
'Nothing particular , Papa , ' answered Dolly , understanding that he referred to her husband . ' He is always out , I hardly see him , ' - she could not resist adding with an ironical smile .
'And has he not yet gone to the country to sell the forest ? '
'Dear me ! ' said the Prince . ' And so I am also to prepare ?
Her father 's words seemed very simple , but they made Kitty feel as confused and flurried as a detected criminal .
'Yes , he knows and understands it all , and in these words is telling me that , though I am ashamed , I must get over my shame . ' 
She could not gather spirit enough to reply .
She made an attempt , but suddenly burst into tears and ran away .
The Princess flew at her husband : ' That comes of your jokes . You always ... ' and she began reproaching him .
The Prince listened for some time to her rebukes in silence , but his face frowned more and more .
'She is so pitiful , poor thing , so pitiful , and you don 't feel that every allusion to what has caused it hurts her .
There always have been and there still are laws against such fellows !
Yes , and if nothing had been done that ought not to have been done , I , old as I am , would have challenged him - that fop !
Yes , now go and dose her , and call in these quacks ! '
The Prince appeared to have much more to say , but as soon as the Princess heard his tone she , as always happened in serious cases , gave in and became repentant .
'Alexander , Alexander , ' she whispered , moving nearer and bursting into tears .
You suffer too , I know .
God is merciful ... thank you ... ' he went on , no longer knowing what he was saying , and after responding to his wife 's wet kiss which he felt on his hand , he went out .
When Kitty , in tears , had left the room , Dolly , with her motherly habit of mind , at once saw that here a woman 's task lay before her , and prepared to fulfil it .
She took off her bonnet and , having mentally rolled up her sleeves , prepared for action .
While her mother was attacking her father , she tried to restrain the former as far as filial respect permitted .
'I wanted to tell you something long ago , Mama . Do you know that Levin wished to propose to Kitty when he was here last ?
But I know it is all because of that ... '
'Yes , and just imagine if she refused Levin - and she would not have refused him if it had not been for that other . I know ...
'Oh ! I can 't make anything out !
Nowadays girls all want to trust to their own reason . They don 't tell their mothers anything , and then ...
'Mama , I will go to her . ' 
Am I preventing you ? ' said the mother .
Her heart grew chill when she saw Kitty sitting on the low chair nearest the door , her eyes fixed on a corner of the carpet .
Kitty glanced at her sister , but the cold and rather severe expression of her face did not change .
'I am going home now and shall have to shut myself up , and you won 't be able to come to me , ' said Dolly , sitting down beside her sister . ' I want to talk to you . ' 
'What about ? ' asked Kitty quickly , lifting her face in alarm .
'I have no troubles . ' 
Do you think I can help knowing ?
And believe me it is so unimportant ...
Kitty was silent and her face looked stern .
'He is not worthy of your suffering for him , ' continued Dolly , going straight to the point .
'No , because he has despised me , ' said Kitty with a shaking voice . ' Don 't speak !
Please don 't speak ! '
Nobody says so !
I am sure he was in love with you and is still in love , but ... '
'Oh dear ! these commiserations are what I dread most of all ! ' cried Kitty , suddenly flaring up .
She turned on her chair , blushed , and began rapidly moving her fingers , pressing now with one hand and now with the other the buckle of a belt she was holding .
And it is my sister who says that to me . My sister who imagines ... that ... that she sympathizes with me ! ...
I don 't want this commiseration and hypocrisy ! '
'Why do you torment me ? '
But Kitty in her excitement did not listen to her .
'There is nothing for me to grieve for or seek comfort about .
I have enough pride never to let myself love a man who does not love me . ' 
'But I am not suggesting it ...
The mention of Levin seemed to deprive Kitty of the last fragments of self @-@ control : she jumped up from her chair , threw the buckle on the floor , and rapidly gesticulating with her hands she began :
'What has Levin to do with it ?
I don 't understand why you need torment me !
I have said and I repeat I will never , never do what you are doing - returning to a man who has betrayed you and has loved another woman .
I can 't understand it !
You may do it , but I can 't . ' 
The humiliation of which she was always conscious was peculiarly painful when her sister touched on it .
She had not expected such cruelty from her , and was angry with her .
But suddenly she heard the rustle of a dress and a burst of suppressed sobbing . A pair of arms encircled her neck from below and Kitty was kneeling before her .
And the sweet tear @-@ stained face hid itself in the folds of Dolly 's dress .
Kitty did not say a word of this ; she spoke only of her state of mind .
'I have no troubles whatever , ' she said when she had grown calm , - ' but can you understand that everything has become horrid , disgusting and coarse to me , and above all I myself ?
You can 't think what horrid thoughts I have about everything . ' 
'But what horrid thoughts can you have ? ' asked Dolly smiling .
'The very nastiest and coarsest , I can 't tell you .
It is as if all that was good in me had hidden itself , and only what is horrid remains .
How am I to tell you ? ' - she continued , noticing perplexity in her sister 's eyes : - ' Papa began to speak to me just now ... It seems to me that he thinks that all I need is to get married .
Mama takes me to a ball : and it seems to me she only takes me there to marry me off as quickly as possible and get rid of me .
I know it is not true , but I can 't get rid of the idea .
I always think they are taking my measure .
Formerly to go anywhere in a ball @-@ dress was just a pleasure to me . I used to like myself in it ; but now I feel ashamed and uncomfortable .
'Well , you see , everything appears to me in the coarsest and most horrid aspect , ' she continued . ' That is my illness .
Perhaps it will pass ... '
I only feel comfortable with children , only in your house . ' 
'What a pity you can 't come to see us ! '
And Kitty insisted on having her own way , went to her sister 's , and nursed the children all through the scarlet fever that really attacked them .
The two sisters nursed all the six children successfully through the illness , but Kitty 's health did not improve , and in Lent the Shcherbatskys went abroad .
THE HIGHEST PETERSBURG SOCIETY IS REALLY ALL ONE : all who belong to it know and even visit one another .
But this large circle has its subdivisions .
Anna Arkadyevna Karenina had friends and close connections in three different sets .
One of these was her husband 's official set , consisting of his colleagues and subordinates , who in most varied and capricious ways were connected and separated by social conditions .
Anna found it hard now to recall the feeling of almost religious respect she had at first felt for these people .
Another circle with which Anna was intimate was that through which Karenin had made his career .
The centre of that circle was the Countess Lydia Ivanovna .
It consisted of elderly , plain , philanthropic and pious women and clever , well @-@ educated , ambitious men .
One of the clever men who belonged to it called it , ' the conscience of Petersburg Society . ' 
Karenin set great value on this circle , and Anna , who knew how to get on with every one , had during the first part of her life in Petersburg made friends in it too .
But now , on her return from Moscow , that circle became unbearable to her .
It seemed to her that she , and all of them , were only pretending , and she felt so bored and uncomfortable in that Society that she visited Lydia Ivanovna as rarely as possible .
'When I am old and ugly I will become like that , ' Betsy used to say , ' but for you , a young and beautiful woman , it is too early to settle down in that alms @-@ house . ' 
She avoided her moral friends and went into grand Society .
There she saw Vronsky , and experienced a tremulous joy when meeting him .
She met him most frequently at Betsy 's , who was a Vronsky herself and his cousin .
Vronsky went everywhere where he had a chance of meeting Anna , and spoke to her of his love whenever he could .
She was aware that when they met joy lit up her eyes and drew her lips into a smile , but she could not hide the expression of that joy .
A famous prima donna was giving her second performance and all high Society was at the Opera House .
Vronsky , from the front row of the stalls , seeing his cousin , went to her box without waiting for the interval .
Vronsky looked at her inquiringly .
She nodded , and he thanked her by a smile and sat down beside her .
'And how well I remember your ridicule ! ' continued the Princess Betsy , who took particular pleasure in following the progress of this passion . ' What has become of it all ?
You are caught , my dear fellow ! '
He knew very well that he ran no risk of appearing ridiculous either in Betsy 's eyes or in the eyes of Society people generally .
'And why did you not come to dinner ? ' she said admiringly .
'I must tell you about that .
I 'll give you a hundred or a thousand guesses - and you won 't find out !
'You must tell me all about it , ' she said , rising . ' Come back in the next interval . ' 
'What ? From Nilsson ? ' asked Betsy , quite horrified , though she could not have distinguished Nilsson 's voice from that of a chorus girl .
'It can 't be helped , I have an appointment there in connection with this same peacemaking of mine . ' 
'- " Blessed are the peacemakers , for they will be saved ! " - ' said Betsy , remembering that she had heard some one say something like that . ' Well , then , sit down and tell me about it . ' 
And she sat down again .
'IT 'S RATHER IMPROPER but so charming that I long to tell it , ' said Vronsky , gazing at her with laughing eyes . ' I shan 't mention names . ' 
'So much the better . I shall guess them . ' 
'Well then , listen : two gay young fellows were out driving ... '
'Officers of your regiment , of course ? '
'I didn 't say officers , but just two young men who had been lunching ... '
'It may be .
They were on their way to dine with a comrade , and in the highest spirits .
They see that a pretty woman in a hired sledge is passing them , looking at them , and laughing and nodding to them - at any rate they think so .
Of course off they go after her , galloping full speed .
To their surprise the lovely one stops at the door of the very house they are going to .
She runs up to the top flat .
They only manage to see a pair of red lips beneath a short veil , and lovely little feet ... '
'You tell it with so much feeling that I think you yourself must have been one of the two . ' 
'And what did you say to me just now ?
Well , the young men go into their comrade 's flat . He was giving a farewell dinner .
There they may really have drunk rather too much , as always happens at farewell dinners .
At dinner they inquire who lives in the top flat .
No one knows ; but their host 's footman , in answer to their question whether " girls " lived there , replies that there are a lot of them thereabouts .
'Why do you tell me such horrors ?
A maid opens the door ; they give her the letter and assure her that they are both so much in love that they will die at once on the doorstep .
Suddenly a gentleman with sausage @-@ shaped whiskers , and as red as a lobster , appears , announces that no one but his wife lives in that flat and turns them both out ... '
'How do you know he had " sausage @-@ shaped whiskers , " as you say ? '
'You just listen !
The Titular Councillor lodges a complaint , and I turn into a peacemaker - and what a peacemaker ! ...
I assure you Talleyrand was nothing to me ! '
'What was the difficulty ? '
'You shall hear .
We duly apologized : " We are in despair ; we beg to be forgiven for our unfortunate mistake . "
The Titular Councillor with his sausages begins to thaw , but also wishes to express his feelings , and as soon as he begins to express them he begins to get excited and grows insulting , and again I have to set all my diplomatic talents in motion .
" I agree that they acted badly , but beg you to consider that it was a mistake ; consider their youth ; besides which the young men had just dined .
They repent from the bottom of their hearts , and ask you to forgive their fault . "
Petritsky ; whom Vronsky was fond of , was mixed up in the affair , and so was young Prince Kedrov , a first @-@ rate fellow and a capital comrade , who had lately joined the regiment .
Above all , the interests of the regiment were involved .
Both officers belonged to Vronsky 's squadron .
Titular Councillor Wenden had been to see the Commander and had lodged a complaint against the officers who had insulted his wife .
These officers , in their sledge , raced after her ; she became frightened , and feeling still more unwell ran up the stairs to her flat .
Wenden himself , having returned from his office and hearing the front @-@ door bell and voices , went out , saw the tipsy officers with the letter , and hustled them out .
'No , say what you like , ' the Commander remarked to Vronsky , whom he had invited to his house , ' Petritsky is becoming impossible .
Vronsky realized how ungrateful a task it was - that a duel was out of the question , and that everything must be done to soften the Titular Councillor and hush up the affair .
The C.O. had called Vronsky in just because he knew him to be honourable and able , and above all a man who valued the honour of the regiment .
After discussing the matter , they decided that Vronsky should go with Petritsky and Kedrov to apologize to the Councillor .
Having reached the French Theatre , Vronsky went out into the foyer with the C.O. , and informed him of his success or lack of success .
'A bad business , but most amusing !
Kedrov cannot fight that good man !
Wonderful ! ' he went on , referring to the new French actress . ' However often one sees her , she is new each day .
Only the French can do that ! '
PRINCESS BETSY WENT HOME without waiting for the end of the last act .
The conversation in both circles , as always happens at first , hesitated for a few minutes , was interrupted by greetings , recognitions , and offers of tea , and seemed to be seeking something to settle on .
'She is wonderfully good as an actress , one sees that she has studied Kaulbach , ' remarked an attaché in the circle round the ambassador 's wife . ' Did you notice how she fell ... '
This was the Princess Myagkaya , notorious for her simplicity and the roughness of her manners , and nicknamed l 'enfant terrible .
The conversation was broken by this remark , and it became necessary to find another topic .
'People say that is very difficult , and that only what is malicious is amusing , ' he began with a smile .
Once one has a theme , it is easy to embroider on it .
I often think that the famous talkers of the last century would find it difficult to talk cleverly nowadays .
'That was said long ago , ' interrupted the ambassador 's wife , laughingly .
The conversation had begun very prettily , but just because it was too pretty it languished again .
They had to return to the one sure and never @-@ failing resource - slander .
'Don 't you think there is something Louis Quinze about Tushkevich ? ' said the attaché , glancing at a handsome , fair @-@ haired young man who stood by the tea @-@ table .
He matches the drawing @-@ room ; that is why he comes here so often ! '
This conversation did not flag , since it hinted at what could not be spoken of in this room , namely , at the relations existing between Tushkevich and their hostess .
'Have you heard ? That that Maltyshcheva woman also - not the daughter but the mother - is having a diable rose costume made for herself ? '
'I wonder that she , with her common sense - for she is not stupid - does not see how ridiculous she makes herself . ' 
Every one had something disparaging to say about the unfortunate Maltyshcheva , and the conversation began crackling merrily like a kindling bonfire .
Stepping silently on the thick carpet , he approached the Princess Myagkaya .
'How did you like Nilsson ? ' he inquired .
'Oh , how can you steal on one like that ?
How you frightened me ! ' said she in reply . ' Please don 't talk to me about the opera - you know nothing of music .
I had better descend to your level and talk about your majolica and engravings .
I have learnt from those - what is their name ? - the bankers ... They have some splendid engravings .
'What ? Have you been to the Schuzburgs ? ' asked the hostess from her place by the samovar .
We had to invite them , and I gave them a sauce that cost eighty @-@ five kopeks , and satisfied every one .
'Wonderful ! ' said some one else .
In the Society in which she lived words of that kind produced the effect of a most witty joke .
The Princess Myagkaya did not understand why her words had such an effect , but was aware that they did and availed herself of it .
'Will you really not have a cup of tea ?
'No , we are very comfortable here , ' replied the ambassador 's wife smiling , and she continued the interrupted conversation .
It was a very pleasant conversation .
They were disparaging the Karenins , husband and wife .
'Anna has changed very much since her trip to Moscow .
There is something strange about her , ' said a friend of Anna 's .
'The chief change is that she has brought back with her the shadow of Alexis Vronsky , ' said the ambassador 's wife .
Grimm has a fable called " The Man Without a Shadow " - about a man who lost his shadow as a punishment for something or other .
I never could understand why it was a punishment !
'Yes , but a woman with a shadow generally ends badly , ' said Anna 's friend .
'A murrain on your tongue ! ' suddenly remarked the Princess Myagkaya , hearing these words . ' Anna Karenina is a splendid woman .
'Why don 't you like her husband ?
He is such a remarkable man , ' said the ambassador 's wife . ' My husband says there are few statesmen like him in Europe . ' 
'My husband tells me the same , but I don 't believe it , ' replied the Princess Myagkaya . ' If our husbands didn 't talk , we should see things as they really are ; and it 's my opinion that Karenin is simply stupid .
I say it in a whisper !
'Not at all .
I have no choice .
One of us is stupid , and you know it 's impossible to say so of oneself . ' 
'No one is satisfied with his position , but every one is satisfied with his wit , ' remarked the attaché , quoting some French lines .
'That 's it , that 's just it , ' rejoined the Princess Myagkaya , turning quickly toward him . ' But the point is , that I won 't abandon Anna to you .
She is so excellent , so charming !
What is she to do , if every one is in love with her and follows her about like a shadow ? '
'But I don 't even think of blaming her ! ' Anna 's friend said , justifying herself .
'If no one follows us about like a shadow , that does not prove that we have a right to judge her . ' 
Having snubbed Anna 's friend handsomely , the Princess Myagkaya rose with the ambassador 's wife and joined those at the table , where there was a general conversation about the King of Prussia .
'Whom were you backbiting there ? ' asked Betsy .
'The Karenins .
The Princess was characterizing Karenin , ' replied the ambassador 's wife with a smile , seating herself at the table .
'It 's a pity we did not hear it ! ' said the hostess , glancing at the door . ' Ah ! Here you are at last ! ' she added , smilingly addressing Vronsky as he entered the room .
I have been there a hundred times , and always with fresh pleasure .
I know it 's a disgrace , but at the opera I go to sleep , while at the Bouffe I stay till the last minute enjoying it .
And he named a French actress and was about to tell them something about her when the ambassador 's wife stopped him with mock alarm .
'Please don 't talk about those horrors ! '
'All right , I won 't - especially as everybody knows those horrors ! '
'And everybody would go there if it were considered the thing , as the opera is , ' put in the Princess Myagkaya .
STEPS WERE HEARD AT THE ENTRANCE , and the Princess Betsy , knowing that it was Anna , glanced at Vronsky .
He was looking at the door with a strange new expression on his face .
He bowed low and moved a chair toward her .
But immediately , nodding rapidly to her acquaintances and pressing the hands extended to her , she turned again to her hostess :
'I have just been at the Countess Lydia 's .
'Oh , that missionary ? '
I have seen him .
'Yes ; they say it 's quite settled . ' 
'I am surprised at her parents .
They say it 's a love match . ' 
What antediluvian ideas you have !
Who talks of love nowadays ? ' said the ambassador 's wife .
'What 's to be done ?
That silly old fashion hasn 't died out yet ! ' said Vronsky .
'So much the worse for those who follow the fashion !
'Yes , but how often the happiness of marriages founded on reason crumbles to dust because the very passion that was disregarded makes itself felt later , ' said Vronsky .
'Then some one should invent a way of inoculating love , like vaccination . ' 
'When I was young I was in love with a chorister , ' said Princess Myagkaya . ' I don 't know whether it did me any good . ' 
'No , joking apart , I believe that to understand love one must first make a mistake and then correct it , ' said the Princess Betsy .
'It is never too late to mend ! ' said the attaché , quoting the English proverb .
'Exactly ! ' chimed in Betsy . ' One has to make mistakes and correct them .
What do you think ? ' she asked , addressing Anna , who with a scarcely discernible resolute smile was listening to this conversation .
Vronsky had gazed at Anna and with sinking heart waited to hear what she would say .
He sighed , as after a danger averted , when she had uttered these words .
'I have received a letter from Moscow .
They write that Kitty Shcherbatskaya is very ill . ' 
'Really ? ' said Vronsky , frowning .
'It does not interest you ? '
What exactly do they write , if I may ask ? ' he inquired .
'Give me a cup of tea , ' she said , stopping behind Betsy 's chair .
While Betsy was pouring out the tea , Vronsky went up to Anna .
'What do they write ? ' he asked again .
'I don 't quite understand your meaning , ' he said , handing her the cup .
'I wanted to tell you , ' she began again , without looking at him , ' that you have behaved badly , very badly . ' 
'Don 't I know that I behaved badly ?
But who was the cause ? '
'Why say that to me ? ' she asked , looking severely at him .
'You know why , ' he answered boldly and joyously , meeting her look and continuing to gaze at her .
'That only proves you have no heart , ' she said .
But her look said that she knew he had a heart and that she therefore feared him .
'What you have just referred to was a mistake , and not love . ' 
I have come to tell you that this must stop !
I have never till now had to blush before anyone , but you make me feel as if I were guilty of something . ' 
He looked at her , and was struck by the new , spiritual beauty of her face .
'What do you want of me ? ' he asked , simply and seriously .
'You don 't want that , ' he replied .
He saw that she was saying what she forced herself to utter and not what she wished to say .
'If you love me as you say you do , ' she whispered , ' behave so that I may be at peace . ' 
'Don 't you know that you are all my life to me ? ... But peace I do not know , and can 't give to you .
My whole being , my love ... yes !
I cannot think about you and about myself separately .
You and I are one to me .
And I do not see before us the possibility of peace either for me or for you .
I see the possibility of despair , misfortune ... or of happiness - what happiness ! ...
She exerted all the powers of her mind to say what she ought ; but instead she fixed on him her eyes filled with love and did not answer at all .
'This is it ! ' he thought with rapture . ' Just as I was beginning to despair , and when it seemed as though the end would never come ... here it is !
She acknowledges it ! '
'Do this for me : never say such words to me , and let us be good friends . ' These were her words , but her eyes said something very different .
'Friends we shall not be , you know that yourself ; but whether we shall be the happiest or the most miserable of human beings ... rests with you . ' 
She wished to say something , but he interrupted her .
'I ask only one thing : I ask the right to hope and suffer as I do now ; but if even that is impossible , command me to disappear , and I will do it .
You shall not see me if my presence is painful to you . ' 
'I don 't want to drive you away . ' 
'Only don 't change anything .
Leave everything as it is ! ' he said with trembling voice . ' Here is your husband . ' 
Indeed , just at that moment Karenin , with his deliberate , ungraceful gait , entered the drawing @-@ room .
'Your Hotel Rambouillet is in full muster , ' said he , glancing round the whole company , ' the Graces and the Muses . ' 
But the Princess Betsy could not bear that tone of his : ' sneering , ' she called it in English : so , like a clever hostess , she at once led him into a serious conversation on universal military service .
Karenin was immediately absorbed in the conversation , and began defending the new law very earnestly against the Princess Betsy , who attacked it .
Vronsky and Anna remained sitting at the little table .
'This is becoming indecent ! ' whispered a lady , indicating by a glance Vronsky , Anna , and Anna 's husband .
'What did I tell you ? ' replied Anna 's friend .
Not these two ladies alone , but nearly all those present in the drawing @-@ room , even the Princess Myagkaya and Betsy herself , several times glanced across at the pair who had gone away from the general circle , as if their having done so disturbed the others .
Only Karenin did not once glance that way and was not distracted from the interesting conversation in which he was engaged .
'I am always amazed at your husband 's clearness and exactitude of expression , ' she said . ' The most transcendental ideas become accessible to me when he speaks . ' 
'Oh yes ! ' said Anna , radiant with a smile of happiness and not understanding a single word of what Betsy was saying ; and going across to the big table she joined in the general conversation .
After half an hour 's stay Karenin went up to his wife and suggested that they should go home together ; but , without looking at him , she answered that she would stay to supper .
Karenin bowed to the company and went away .
The footman stood holding open the carriage door .
She gave him her hand , and with her quick elastic step went past the hall @-@ porter and vanished into the carriage .
He kissed the palm of his hand where she had touched it , and went home happy in the knowledge that in this one evening he had made more progress toward his aim than he had during the previous two months .
At the usual hour he rose and prepared for bed .
Anna had not yet returned .
With the book under his arm he went upstairs ; but to @-@ night , instead of his usual thoughts and calculations about his official affairs , his mind was full of his wife and of something unpleasant that had happened concerning her .
Contrary to his habit he did not go to bed , but with his hands clasped behind his back started pacing up and down the rooms .
He felt that he could not lie down , till he had thought over these newly @-@ arisen circumstances .
He was not of a jealous disposition .
Jealousy in his opinion insulted a wife , and a man should have confidence in his wife .
He had lived and worked all his days in official spheres , which deal with reflections of life , and every time he had knocked up against life itself he had stepped out of its way .
He now experienced a sensation such as a man might feel who , while quietly crossing a bridge over an abyss , suddenly sees that the bridge is being taken to pieces and that he is facing the abyss .
The abyss was real life ; the bridge was the artificial life Karenin had been living .
It was the first time that the possibility of his wife 's falling in love with anybody had occurred to him , and he was horrified .
Through her room he reached the door of their bedroom and then turned back again .
'But express what ? What decision ? ' he asked himself in the drawing @-@ room , and could find no answer .
'But after all , ' he reflected before turning into her room , ' what is it that has happened ?
What of that ?
Are there not plenty of men with whom a woman may talk ?
His mind as well as his body performed a complete circle each time without arriving at anything new .
He began thinking about her : of what she thought and felt .
That was the abyss into which he feared to look .
To put himself in thought and feeling into another being was a mental action foreign to Karenin .
He considered such mental acts to be injurious and dangerous romancing .
But what is to be done ?
I am not one of those who suffer anxiety and agitation and have not the courage to look them in the face ! '
'I must think it over , come to a decision , and throw it off , ' he said aloud .
'Well then , ' thought he , ' the question of her feelings and so on are questions for her conscience , which cannot concern me .
My duty is clearly defined .
As head of the family I am the person whose duty it is to guide her , and who is therefore partly responsible ; I must show her the danger which I see , warn her , and even use my authority .
I must speak plainly to her . ' 
What he would say to his wife took clear shape in Karenin 's head .
And interlacing his fingers , palms downwards , he stretched them and the joints cracked .
That movement - a bad habit of cracking his fingers - always tranquillized him and brought him back to that precision of mind which he now so needed .
Karenin , ready to deliver his speech , stood pressing his interlaced fingers together , trying whether some of them would not crack again .
By the sound of her light step on the stair he was aware of her approach and , though he was satisfied with his speech , he felt some apprehension of the coming explanations .
ANNA WALKED IN WITH BOWED HEAD , playing with the tassels of her hood .
Her face shone with a vivid glow , but it was not a joyous glow - it resembled the terrible glow of a conflagration on a dark night .
On seeing her husband she lifted her head and , as if awaking from sleep , smiled .
'You 're not in bed ?
What a wonder ! ' she said , throwing off her hood , and without pausing she went on to her dressing @-@ room . ' Alexis Alexandrovich , it 's high time ! ' she added from beyond the door .
'Anna , I must have a talk with you . ' 
'With me ? ' she said with surprise , coming back from the other room and looking at him . ' What is it ?
What about ? ' she asked , seating herself . ' Well , let us have a talk , if it is so important .
Anna said what came into her head , and hearing her own words was astonished at her capacity for deception .
How simple and natural her words sounded and how really it seemed as if she were merely sleepy !
She felt herself clothed in an impenetrable armour of lies and that some unseen power was helping and supporting her .
'Anna , I must warn you , ' said he .
'Warn me ? ' she asked , ' what about ? '
She looked so naturally and gaily at him , that one who did not know her as her husband did could not have noticed anything strange either in the intonation or the meaning of her words .
He saw that the depths of her soul , till now always open , were closed to him .
More than that , he knew from her tone that she was not ashamed of this , but seemed to be saying frankly : ' Yes , it is closed , and so it should be and will be in future . ' 
He now felt like a man who on coming home finds his house locked against him .
'But perhaps the key can still be found , ' thought Karenin .
'I wish to warn you , ' he said in low tones , ' that you may , by indiscretion and carelessness , give the world occasion to talk about you .
Your too animated conversation to @-@ night with Count Vronsky ' ( he pronounced the name firmly and with quiet deliberation ) ' attracted attention . ' 
As he spoke he looked at her laughing eyes , terrible to him now in their impenetrability , and felt the uselessness and idleness of his words .
I was not dull .
Does that offend you ? '
Karenin started and bent his hands to crack his fingers .
'Oh , please don 't crack your fingers ! I dislike it so ! ' she said .
'Anna , is this you ? ' said he softly , making an effort and refraining from moving his hands .
'But whatever is the matter ? ' she asked in a tone of comical surprise and sincerity . ' What do you want of me ? '
Karenin paused and rubbed his forehead and eyes .
'This is what I intended to say , ' he continued coldly and calmly , ' and I ask you to listen to me .
As you know , I consider jealousy an insulting and degrading feeling and will never allow myself to be guided by it ; but there are certain laws of propriety which one cannot disregard with impunity .
I did not notice it this evening , but , judging by the impression created , all present noticed that you behaved and acted not quite as was desirable . ' 
'Well , I 'm listening ! What next ? ' said she quietly and mockingly . ' I am even listening with interest because I should like to understand what it is all about . ' 
As she spoke she wondered at her quietly natural tone and at her correct choice of words .
Your feelings concern your own conscience , but it is my duty to you , to myself , and to God , to point out to you your duties .
This bond can only be broken by a crime , and that kind of crime brings its punishment . ' 
'I don 't understand anything ...
Oh dear ! And as ill @-@ luck will have it , I am dreadfully sleepy ! ' said she , while with deft fingers she felt for the remaining pins in her hair .
'Anna , for God 's sake don 't talk like that ! ' he said mildly . ' Perhaps I am mistaken , but believe me that what I am saying I say equally for my own sake and for yours .
For an instant her head had drooped and the mocking spark in her eyes had died away , but the word ' love ' aroused her again .
'Love ! ' she thought , ' as if he can love !
If he had never heard people talk of love , he would never have wanted that word .
He does not know what love is . ' 
'Alexis Alexandrovich , I really do not understand , ' she replied . ' Explain what you consider ... '
'Allow me to finish .
I love you .
But I am not talking of myself . The chief persons concerned are our son and yourself .
I repeat - perhaps my words may seem quite superfluous to you ; perhaps they result from a mistake of mine .
In that case I ask your pardon !
But if you feel that there are any grounds , however slight , I beg you to reflect , and if your heart prompts you to tell me ... '
Karenin did not notice that he was saying something quite different from what he had prepared .
'I have nothing to say .
Besides ... ' she added , rapidly , and hardly repressing a smile , ' it really is bedtime . ' 
Karenin sighed , and without saying anything more went into the bedroom .
When she went there he was already in bed .
His lips were sternly compressed and his eyes did not look at her .
Anna got into her bed , and every moment expected that he would address her .
She was afraid of what he would say , and yet wished to hear it .
But he remained silent .
She was thinking of another ; she saw him , and felt her heart fill with excitement and guilty joy at the thought .
Suddenly she heard an even , quiet , nasal sound like whistling .
For a moment the sound he emitted seemed to have startled Karenin , and he stopped ; but , after he had breathed twice , the whistling recommenced with fresh and calm regularity .
'It 's late , it 's late , ' she whispered to herself , and smiled .
For a long time she lay still with wide @-@ open eyes , the brightness of which it seemed to her she could herself see in the darkness .
FROM THAT TIME a new life began for Karenin and his wife .
Nothing particular happened .
Anna went into Society as before , frequently visiting the Princess Betsy , and she met Vronsky everywhere .
Karenin noticed this , but could do nothing .
She met all his efforts to bring about an explanation by presenting an impenetrable wall of merry perplexity .
Externally things seemed as before , but their intimate relations with one another were completely changed .
Karenin , strong as he was in his official activities , felt himself powerless here . Like an ox he waited submissively with bowed head for the pole @-@ axe which he felt was raised above him .
Pale , with trembling lower jaw , he stood over her , entreating her to be calm , himself not knowing why or how .
'Anna , Anna , ' he said in trembling voice , ' Anna , for God 's sake ! ... '
'My God !
Forgive me ! ' she said , sobbing and pressing Vronsky 's hand to her breast .
Looking at him , she felt her degradation physically , and could say nothing more .
He felt what a murderer must feel when looking at the body he has deprived of life .
The body he had deprived of life was their love , the first period of their love .
There was something frightful and revolting in the recollection of what had been paid for with this terrible price of shame .
The shame she felt at her spiritual nakedness communicated itself to him .
But in spite of the murderer 's horror of the body of his victim , that body must be cut in pieces and hidden away , and he must make use of what he has obtained by the murder .
Then , as the murderer desperately throws himself on the body , as though with passion , and drags it and hacks it , so Vronsky covered her face and shoulders with kisses .
She held his hand and did not move . Yes !
These kisses were what had been bought by their shame !
'Yes , and this hand , which will always be mine , is the hand of my accomplice . ' 
He knelt down and tried to see her face , but she hid it and did not speak .
At last , as though mastering herself , she sat up and pushed him away .
Her face was as beautiful as ever , but all the more piteous .
'I cannot help remembering what is life itself to me !
'What bliss ? ' she said with disgust and horror , and the horror was involuntarily communicated to him . ' For heaven 's sake , not another word ! '
She rose quickly and moved away from him . ' Not another word ! ' she repeated , and with a look of cold despair , strange to him , she left him .
She felt that at that moment she could not express in words her feeling of shame , joy , and horror at this entrance on a new life , and she did not wish to vulgarize that feeling by inadequate words .
She said to herself : ' No , I can 't think about it now ; later , when I am calmer . ' 
'Not now ; later , when I am calmer ! ' she said to herself .
But in her dreams , when she had no control over her thoughts , her position appeared to her in all its shocking nakedness .
One dream she had almost every night .
She dreamt that both at once were her husbands , and lavished their caresses on her .
Alexis Alexandrovich wept , kissing her hands , saying : ' How beautiful it is now ! ' and Alexis Vronsky was there too , and he also was her husband .
And she was surprised that formerly this had seemed impossible to her , and laughingly explained to them how much simpler it really was , and that they were both now contented and happy .
But this dream weighed on her like a nightmare , and she woke from it filled with horror .
Now that years have passed , when I remember it , I am surprised that it could have grieved me so much .
So it will be with this grief .
Time will pass , and I shall become indifferent . ' 
But three months passed and he had not become indifferent to it , and to think of it still hurt him as it had done in the first days .
He could not find peace , because he had so long dreamed of family life and felt so ripe for it , but was still unmarried and further than ever from marriage .
He himself felt painfully what all those around him felt too , that it is not good for a man of his age to be alone .
But now he was further from marriage than ever .
The place was unoccupied , and when in imagination he tried to put one of the girls he knew there , he felt that it was quite impossible .
Moreover , the memory of her refusal , and the part he had played in it , tormented him with shame .
However much he told himself that he was not at all to blame in that matter , the memory of it , together with other shameful memories , made him start and blush .
These wounds never closed up .
And among these recollections stood the memory of her refusal and the pitiful role he must have played in the eyes of the others that evening .
The painful memories became more and more covered over by the commonplace but important events of country life .
Every week he thought less and less about Kitty .
He waited impatiently to hear that she was married or was getting married soon , hoping that such news , like the drawing of an aching tooth , would quite cure him .
Meanwhile spring had come , a glorious steady spring , without the expectations and disappointments spring usually brings . It was one of these rare springs which plants , animals , and men alike rejoice in .
This lovely spring roused Levin still more and confirmed him in the determination completely to renounce the past in order to fashion his solitary life firmly and independently .
He was so successful in persuading his brother , and in lending him money for the journey without irritating him , that he was satisfied with himself in this respect .
The spring had set in late .
It thawed in the sunshine by day , but at night the thermometer went down to sixteen degrees Fahrenheit . The snow was covered with a crust of ice so thick that carts could pass even where there were no roads .
Easter found snow still on the ground ; but on Easter Monday a warm wind began to blow , the clouds gathered , and for three days and nights warm stormy rain poured down .
On the Thursday the wind fell and a thick grey mist rose as if to hide the secret of the changes nature was carrying on .
In the morning the bright rising sun quickly melted the thin ice on the water and the warm air all around vibrated with the vapour given off by the awakening earth .
The cows had been let out there , and , warmed by the sunshine , their glossy new coats glistening , they were lowing to be let out into the fields .
The cowherd ran away merrily to get ready .
He sent for the carpenter , who was under contract to be with the threshing @-@ machine , but it turned out that he was mending the harrows , which should have been mended the week before Lent .
This was very annoying to Levin .
It was vexing that the careless farm management , against which he had struggled so many years with all his might , still continued .
He found out that the racks which were not wanted in winter had been taken into the farm @-@ horses ' stable , and there had got broken , as they were lightly made , being meant only for the calves .
Levin sent for the steward , but instead of waiting went at once to look for him himself .
The steward , in his astrakhan @-@ trimmed coat , as radiant as everything else that day , was coming from the threshing @-@ ground breaking a bit of straw in his hands .
'Oh , I meant to tell you yesterday that the harrows need mending .
What is one to do with such people ! ' said the steward , waving his arm .
'It 's not a case of such people , but of such a steward ! ' said Levin flaring up .
'And the clover ? '
'I have sent Vasily , he and Mishka are sowing .
'How many acres ? '
'Why not the lot ? ' shouted Levin .
That they were only sowing sixteen instead of fifty acres with clover was still more annoying .
To grow clover successfully it was necessary according to both theory and his own experience to sow it as early as possible , almost before the snow had finished melting , and Levin could never get this done .
What are you to do with such people ?
'Well then , you should have let the straw wait . ' 
'Five are making compote ' ( he meant compost ) ' and four are turning the oats over . They might begin sprouting , Constantine Dmitrich . ' 
Levin understood very well that ' might begin sprouting ' meant that the English seed @-@ oats were already spoiling . Here again his orders had not been obeyed .
'Oh dear , didn 't I speak about it long ago in Lent ... '
Indeed , the day was so beautiful one could not long remain angry .
'Ignat ! ' he called to the coachman , who with sleeves rolled up was washing a carriage at the pump , ' saddle me ... '
'Oh , Kolpik . ' 
'Carting manure must be started early so that it should be over before the first hay harvest , and the far field will have to be ploughed continually so as to keep the earth clean .
The foreman listened attentively and evidently tried to approve of his master 's plans : but his face still wore that hopeless and despondent expression so familiar to Levin .
Nothing grieved Levin so much as this manner , but it was a manner common to all the numerous stewards he had employed .
Some came to @-@ day , but they wanted seventy roubles each for the summer . ' 
That force was opposing him again .
He knew that try as they would they had never managed to get more than from thirty @-@ seven to forty labourers at the proper price . Forty could be hired , but never more than forty .
Yet all the same he could not but continue the struggle .
'Send to Sury and to Chefirovka , if they don 't come .
'I 'll send right enough , ' said Vasily Fedorich , the steward , despondently . ' But the horses too are getting weak . ' 
But don 't I know , ' he added laughing , ' that you always want less of everything and worse ? However , this year I will not let you have your way .
'You don 't sleep much as it is , I think .
'You won 't be able to cross the brook , Constantine Dmitrich , ' the coachman called out .
And Levin rode across the muddy yard and out of the gate into the field at a brisk amble , his fresh little horse snorting at the puddles and pulling at the bridle .
If he had felt light @-@ hearted in the cattle and farm yards , he felt still more so in the fields .
When he had passed the forest , a vast expanse of velvety green unrolled before him without a single bare spot , and only sprinkled here and there in the hollows with patches of unmelted snow .
Dreaming such dreams , carefully guiding his horse so as not to trample down his young growth , he rode up to the labourers who were sowing the clover .
The earth in the cart with which the seeds were mixed was not rubbed fine , but was pressed or frozen into lumps .
On seeing the master the labourer Vasily moved toward the cart and Mishka began to sow .
This was not right , but Levin seldom got angry with the hired men .
When Vasily came up Levin told him to take the cart and horse on to the border .
'Yes , sir , ' answered Vasily , and took hold of the horse 's head .
'But the sowing , Constantine Dmitrich , is getting on first @-@ rate , ' he said making up to the master .
'Only the walking is dreadful .
'And why has not the earth been sifted ? ' said Levin .
'Oh , but we crumble it up , ' said Vasily , taking a handful and rubbing the earth between his palms .
Vasily was not to blame that they had given him unsifted earth , but still it was annoying .
Having more than once successfully tested a patent remedy for conquering vexation and making all that seemed wrong right again , Levin employed it now .
He looked at the strides Mishka took dragging the enormous lumps of earth that stuck to his feet , dismounted , took the seed @-@ basket from Vasily , and prepared to sow .
'Where did you stop ? '
Vasily pointed to a mark with his foot and Levin began scattering the seeds and earth as best he could .
It was hard walking , and having done a row Levin , wet with perspiration , stopped and gave back the basket .
'Mind , sir , and don 't scold me for this row when summer comes , ' said Vasily .
'Why ? ' said Levin merrily , feeling that his remedy was acting well .
You just look where I sowed last spring , how regularly I scattered it over .
I don 't like to do things badly myself and I see that others don 't .
When one looks over there it makes one 's heart rejoice , ' said Vasily , pointing to the field .
I 've been home , and my old father also has sown three measures of wheat .
They say it has caught up the rye . ' 
'And have you been sowing wheat long ? '
'Well , mind and rub the lumps , ' said Levin , going up to his horse , ' and keep an eye on Mishka , and if the clover comes up well you shall have fifty kopeks for each desyatina . ' 
We are very grateful to you as it is . ' 
Levin mounted his horse and rode to the field where clover had been sown the year before , and to another which was deeply ploughed and ready for sowing the spring wheat .
The clover was coming on splendidly .
It was already reviving and steadily growing green among last year 's wheat stubble .
It was quite impossible to ride over the deeply @-@ ploughed field ; the earth bore only where there was still a little ice , in the thawed furrows the horse 's legs sank in above its pasterns .
Everything was beautiful and gay .
'There must be some snipe too , ' he thought , and just at the turning to his house he met the keeper , who confirmed his supposition .
Levin rode on at a trot , so as to have dinner and get his gun ready for the evening .
AS LEVIN , IN THE HIGHEST SPIRITS , was nearing the house he heard the sound of a tinkling bell approaching the main entrance .
Who is it ?
Can it be brother Nicholas ?
But he was ashamed of that feeling , and immediately , as it were , opened out his spiritual arms and with tender joy expected , and now hoped with his whole soul , that it was his brother .
It was not his brother .
'Oh , if only it 's some nice fellow with whom one can have a talk , ' he thought .
'Ah , ' he cried , joyfully lifting both arms , ' here 's a welcome guest !
Well , I am glad to see you ! ' he exclaimed , recognizing Oblonsky .
'I shall know now for certain whether she is married or when she will be , ' thought Levin .
And on this lovely day he felt that the memory of her did not hurt him at all .
'It would have been worse still on wheels , Constantine Dmitrich , ' said the driver , whom Levin knew .
'Well , I am very , very glad to see you , ' said Levin with a sincere smile , joyful as a child 's .
Agatha Mikhaylovna , always much concerned about the honour of the house , met him in the hall with questions about dinner .
'Do just as you please , only be quick , ' he said and went out to see the steward .
When he returned , Oblonsky , fresh and clean , with hair brushed , and face radiant with smiles , was just coming out of his room , and they went upstairs together .
Now I shall be able to understand what the mysteries you perpetrate here consist of .
What a house , and everything so splendid , so light , so gay ! ' said Oblonsky , forgetting that it was not always spring and bright weather there , as on that day . ' And your nurse ! quite charming !
A pretty house @-@ maid with a little apron would be preferable ; but with your severe and monastic style this one is more suitable . ' 
Oblonsky had much interesting news to tell , and one item of special interest to Levin was that his brother , Sergius Ivanich , intended to come and stay in the country with him that summer .
Not a word did Oblonsky say about Kitty or about any of the Shcherbatskys ; he only delivered greetings from his wife .
Levin was grateful to him for his delicacy and was very glad of his visit .
'Splendid , splendid ! ' he said , lighting a thick cigarette after the joint ' I seem to have come to you as one lands from a noisy steamer on to a peaceful shore .
So you maintain that the labourer should be studied as one of the factors which should decide the choice of agricultural methods ?
You know I am quite an outsider in these matters , but I should think this theory and its application ought to influence the labourer too . ' 
'Yes , but wait a bit , I am not talking about political economy but about the science of agriculture .
It should resemble the natural sciences and should examine existing phenomena , including the labourer with his economic and ethnographic ... '
At that moment Agatha Mikhaylovna came in with some jam .
'Ah , Agatha Mikhaylovna , ' said Oblonsky , kissing the tips of his plump fingers ; ' what smoked goose you have , what herb brandy ! ...
'High time , high time ! Kuzma , tell them to harness the trap , ' he said , and ran downstairs .
Oblonsky went down and himself carefully took the canvas cover off the varnished case , opened it , and set to work to put together his valuable gun , which was of the newest type .
Kuzma , already scenting a substantial tip , did not leave Oblonsky for a moment . He put on his stockings and his boots for him , and Oblonsky willingly allowed him to do so .
'Are you selling the forest to Ryabinin ? '
'Yes . Do you know him ? '
I have had dealings with him positively and finally . ' 
'Positively and finally ' were the dealer 's favourite words .
'Yes , he does speak very funnily .
She knows where the master is going , ' he added , patting Laska , who was whining and jumping round Levin , now licking his hand , now his boots and his gun .
The trap was standing at the door when they went out .
'No , let us drive , ' said Oblonsky , stepping up into the trap . ' 
He sat down , wrapped a rug round his legs , and lit a cigar . ' How is it you don 't smoke . ?
A cigar is such a ... not exactly a pleasure , but the crown and sign of pleasure .
Ah , this is life !
How delightful !
'But who prevents you ? ' Levin remarked , smiling .
'No - you are a lucky fellow !
You have got all you are fond of .
'Perhaps it is because I am glad of what I get , and don 't grieve about what I haven 't , ' said Levin , thinking of Kitty .
Oblonsky understood and looked at him but said nothing .
'Well , and how are your affairs ? ' he asked , recollecting how wrong it was of him to be thinking only of his own concerns .
I am made that way . And really so little harm is done to anyone , and one gets so much pleasure ... '
'Is there anything new then ? ' inquired Levin .
Well , you know Ossian 's type of woman - such as one sees in a dream ?
Well , there are such women in reality , and these women are terrible .
Woman , you see , is an object of such a kind that study it as much as you will , it is always quite new . ' 
Some mathematician has said pleasure lies not in discovering truth but in seeking it . ' 
Levin listened in silence , but in spite of all his efforts he could not enter into his friend 's soul and understand his feeling , nor the delight of studying women of that kind .
When they had reached the wood Levin got down and led Oblonsky to the corner of a mossy and marshy glade , already free from snow .
The sun was setting behind the forest , and the little birches interspersed among the aspen trees stood out clearly against the evening glow with their drooping branches and their swollen buds ready to burst into leaf .
From the thicket , where the snow had not all melted , the water still flowed in branching streamlets with a gentle rippling sound .
'Just fancy !
One can hear and see the grass growing , ' thought Levin , as he noticed a wet slate @-@ coloured aspen leaf move close to the point of a blade of grass .
A hawk flew leisurely past , high above the distant forest ; another followed in the same direction and vanished .
In the thicket the birds chirped louder and louder and more eagerly .
A tawny owl hooted near by , and Laska started , took a few careful steps , and with her head on one side again listened intently .
A cuckoo called beyond the river .
It called twice in its usual note then hoarsely and hurriedly and got out of time .
'Fancy a cuckoo already ! ' said Oblonsky , appearing from behind a bush .
'Yes , I heard , ' answered Levin , so reluctant to disturb the silence of the wood that his own voice sounded unpleasant to him . ' They won 't be long now . ' 
Oblonsky 's figure again disappeared behind the bush , and Levin only saw the flare of a match , followed by the red glow of a cigarette and a spiral of blue smoke .
Click ! click ! Oblonsky cocked his gun .
'And what 's that screaming ? ' he asked , drawing Levin 's attention to a long @-@ drawn cry like the high @-@ pitched whinny of a colt in play .
Levin looked to the right and to the left , and there before him against the dull light @-@ blue sky , over the lower branches of the aspen tops , appeared the flying birds .
'A wretched miss with the right barrel , ' replied Oblonsky , reloading . ' Hush ... coming ! '
Indeed , they heard two shrill whistles quickly following each other .
Two snipe , playing and racing one another , whistling but not crying , flew almost over the sportsmen 's heads .
Oblonsky brought down two more birds , and Levin brought down two , of which one was not recovered .
Through the young birches , Venus bright and silvery , was already shining with her delicate glitter low down in the west and high up in the east flickered the red fire of the dim Arcturus .
Above his head Levin found , and again lost , stars of the Great Bear .
Being in the west Venus would be setting , not rising . ] and all the stars of the Great Bear should be visible .
'Is it not time to go ? ' asked Oblonsky .
'As you please . ' 
They were now standing some fifteen yards apart .
'Stephen ! ' said Levin suddenly and unexpectedly ' why don 't you tell me whether your sister @-@ in @-@ law is married , or when she will be ? '
Levin felt so strong and calm that he thought the answer , whatever it might be , could not agitate him , but he did not at all expect the reply Oblonsky gave him .
'She has not thought , and is not thinking , of getting married , but she is very ill and the doctors have sent her abroad .
'You don 't mean it ! ' exclaimed Levin . ' Very ill ?
What 's the matter with her ?
While they were talking Laska , pricking her ears , kept looking up at the sky and then reproachfully at them .
'What a time they have chosen to talk , ' thought she . ' And there it comes flying ...
Just so , here it is .
They 'll miss it ... '
'Oh ! but there was something unpleasant ! ' he thought . ' Yes , of course , Kitty is ill !
But what can I do ? I am very sorry , ' he thought .
ON THEIR WAY HOME Levin inquired the particulars of Kitty 's illness and of the Shcherbatskys ' plans , and though he would have been ashamed to confess it , what he heard was agreeable to him .
It was agreeable because there was still hope for him , and even more because she was suffering , she who had made him suffer so much .
But when Oblonsky began to speak of what caused Kitty 's illness and to mention Vronsky 's name , Levin interrupted him :
'I have no right whatever to know such family details and frankly I am not interested in them either . ' 
Oblonsky gave a scarcely perceptible smile on noticing the quick change , so familiar to him , in Levin 's face , which became as gloomy as it had been bright a moment before .
'Have you finally settled with Ryabinin about the forest ? ' asked Levin .
'Yes , I have .
'The fact is you are giving the forest away , ' said Levin moodily .
'Why giving away ? ' said Oblonsky with a good @-@ natured smile , knowing well that everything would now seem wrong to Levin .
'Because the forest is worth at least five hundred roubles a desyatina , ' replied Levin .
'Oh , you country gentlemen ! ' said Oblonsky jokingly . ' And your tone of contempt for us poor townfolk ! ...
But when it comes to getting business done , we do it better than anyone .
Believe me , I have reckoned it all out , ' continued he , ' and have sold the forest so well that I am afraid he may change his mind .
You know it 's not timber but , for the most part , only fit for fuel , ' said he , hoping by this remark finally to convince Levin of the injustice of his suspicions .
Levin smiled contemptuously .
Have you counted the trees ? '
'How can one count the trees ? ' said Oblonsky , still anxious to dispel his friend 's ill @-@ humour . ' " Count grains of sand , " and planets ' rays E 'en though a lofty mind were able ... " '
'Well , Ryabinin 's lofty mind is able to do it .
And no dealer will ever buy without first counting , unless the forest is given to him for nothing , as you are doing .
I know your forest .
I go shooting there every year , and it is worth five hundred roubles a desyatina cash down and he is paying you two hundred on long term .
'Come , don 't get so carried away , ' said Oblonsky piteously . ' Why did no one offer more ? '
'Because he and the other dealers are in league , and he has bought them off .
I have had dealings with them all , and I know them .
They are not genuine dealers , but sharks .
He would not consider a deal which would bring him in ten or fifteen per cent ; he waits till he can buy at a fifth of the value . ' 
'Not at all , ' said Levin gloomily , just as they drove up to the house .
Ryabinin himself was already in the house and met the two friends in the hall .
He was a tall , spare , middle @-@ aged man , with a moustache , a prominent shaven chin , and prominent dim eyes .
He wore a long @-@ skirted blue coat with buttons very low down at the back , high boots drawn quite straight over the calves of his legs and crinkled round the ankles , and over them he had on a pair of large goloshes .
He wiped his face all round with his handkerchief , and smoothing his coat , which was already quite in order , smilingly greeted the new arrivals . He held out his hand to Oblonsky as if he were trying to catch something .
'Oh , so you have come , ' said Oblonsky taking his hand . ' That 's right ! '
'I dared not disobey your Excellency 's commands , though the roads are quite too bad .
'Constantine Dmitrich , my respects to you ! ' he said turning to Levin and trying to catch his hand too .
'Would you like to go into my study ? ' said Levin , frowning moodily , and addressing Oblonsky in French . ' Go into the study , you can talk things over there . ' 
On entering the study Ryabinin looked round by force of habit as though to find the icon , but after finding it he did not cross himself .
He glanced at the book cupboards and book @-@ shelves with the same look of doubt as he had bestowed on the snipe , smiled contemptuously , and again shook his head disapprovingly , decidedly refusing to admit that this game could be worth the candle .
'Well , have you brought the money ? ' asked Oblonsky . ' Take a seat . ' 
'There won 't be any difficulty about the money .
'Talk what matters over ?
'I can do that , ' said Ryabinin , sitting down and putting his arm on the back of his chair in a most uncomfortable way . ' You must let me off something , Prince .
Levin , who had been putting away his gun in a cupboard , was just going out of the door , but on hearing the dealer 's words he stopped .
Ryabinin rose and smiled silently , surveying Levin from his feet to his head .
'He is very close , is Constantine Dmitrich , ' he said , addressing Oblonsky with a smile . ' It 's absolutely impossible to buy anything of him .
'Why should I give you what is mine for nothing ?
I have not found it on the ground nor stolen it . ' 
'Oh dear no , nowadays it is quite impossible to steal .
Absolutely everything nowadays goes before a jury , everything is judged honourably , there 's no possibility of stealing .
We speak honestly .
If you have , there 's no use bargaining , but if not , ' said Levin , ' I will buy the forest myself . ' 
The smile vanished from Ryabinin 's face , which assumed a hawk @-@ like , rapacious , and cruel expression .
'If you please , the forest is mine , ' he said , rapidly crossing himself and holding out his hand . ' Take your money , the forest is mine .
That 's the way Ryabinin does business , no fussing about kopeks , ' he said , frowning and flourishing his pocket @-@ book .
'If I were you I should not be in a hurry to take it , ' remarked Levin .
'What d 'you mean ? ' said Oblonsky with surprise . ' Why , I 've given my word . ' 
Levin went out and slammed the door .
Ryabinin looked at it and smiled , shaking his head .
'That 's all his youthfulness , his absolute childishness .
Why , I am making this purchase , believe me , just for the honour and glory of the thing , so that it should be Ryabinin and not another that has bought Oblonsky 's forest .
An hour later the dealer ; with his coat well lapped over , the hooks of his overcoat carefully fastened , and with the agreement in his pocket , seated himself in his little cart and drove home .
" That 's so , " responded the clerk , handing him the reins and buttoning the leather apron . " But I can congratulate you on the purchase , Mihail Ignatitch ? "
OBLONSKY WENT UPSTAIRS , his pockets bulging with the treasury @-@ bills payable in three months ' time with which Ryabinin had paid him .
He wanted to finish the day at supper as pleasantly as he had begun it .
Levin really was in a bad humour , and in spite of his desire to behave kindly and amiably to his charming guest he could not master himself .
The intoxication of the news that Kitty was not married was beginning little by little to take effect on him .
Kitty was unmarried and ill , and ill for love of the man who had slighted her .
Vronsky had slighted her and she had slighted him , Levin .
Consequently Vronsky had a right to despise him and was therefore his enemy .
But Levin did not think all this .
He dimly felt that there was something insulting to him in the affair , and was angry not with what had upset him but with everything that presented itself to him .
The stupid sale of the forest , the swindle Oblonsky had fallen a prey to , which had been perpetrated in his house , irritated him .
'Well , have you finished ? ' he said when he met Oblonsky upstairs . ' Will you have some supper ? '
'I won 't say no .
What an appetite I get in the country , wonderful !
Why did you not offer Ryabinin something to eat ? '
'Well , really , how you treat him ! ' said Oblonsky . ' You did not even give him your hand .
Why not shake hands with him ? '
'Because I do not shake hands with the footman , and the footman is a hundred times better than he . ' 
'What a reactionary you really are !
What about merging the classes ? ' said Oblonsky .
'I see you are quite a reactionary . ' 
I am Constantine Levin , that 's all . ' 
'And Constantine Levin is in a very bad temper , ' said Oblonsky , smiling .
'Yes , I am in a bad temper , and do you know why ?
Because , excuse me , of your stupid sale . ' 
Oblonsky wrinkled his face good @-@ naturedly , like an innocent man who was being hurt and interfered with .
'Oh don 't ! ' he said . ' When has a man ever sold anything without being told immediately after that it was worth much more ?
No , I see you have a grudge against that unfortunate Ryabinin . ' 
And impoverished not from extravagance . That would not matter so much : to spend like a nobleman is their business - only the noblesse know how to do it .
At present the peasants around here are buying land - that does not pain me .
The squire does nothing , the peasant works and squeezes out the idler .
But it hurts me to see this impoverishment as a result of , - shall I call it simplicity ?
Here a Polish leaseholder buys for half its value the splendid estate of a lady who lives in Nice .
There land that is worth ten roubles a desyatina is leased to a merchant for one rouble .
'Certainly count them !
Ryabinin 's children will have the means to live and get an education , while yours may not have ! '
'Well , forgive me , but there is something petty in all this counting .
We have our occupation and they have theirs , and they have to make a profit .
And here come the fried eggs , just the way I like them best .
Oblonsky sat down to table and began joking with Agatha Mikhaylovna , assuring her that it was long since he had had such a dinner and supper as that day .
'Well , you appreciate it at least , ' said Agatha Mikhaylovna ; ' but Constantine Dmitrich , whatever one gives him , if it were only a crust of bread , would just eat it and go away . ' 
Try as Levin would to control himself , he remained morose and silent .
There was one question he wanted to put to Oblonsky , but could not bring himself to ask , nor could he find the form to put it in or the moment to ask it .
'Yes , by the by , where is Vronsky now ? ' he asked , suddenly putting down the soap .
'Vronsky ? ' said Oblonsky , ceasing to yawn . ' He is in Petersburg .
He left soon after you did , and has not been in Moscow once since then .
But , as I told you then , I do not know who had the better chance .
I told you at the time that ... ' He yawned , but only with his jaw , without opening his mouth .
The insult of the refusal he had had to face burned in his heart like a fresh , newly @-@ received wound .
But he was at home and the walls of home are helpful .
'Wait , wait , ' he began , interrupting Oblonsky . ' You talk of his being an aristocrat .
But I should like to ask you what is Vronsky 's or anyone else 's aristocracy that I should be slighted because of it ?
You consider Vronsky an aristocrat . I don 't .
A man whose father crawled up from nothing by intrigues and whose mother has had relations with heaven knows whom ...
I agree with you , ' said Oblonsky sincerely and cheerfully , though he felt that Levin ranked him with those who could be bought for silver .
Levin 's vehemence sincerely pleased him . ' Whom are you driving at ?
Though much of what you say is not true of Vronsky , I am not speaking about that .
I want to tell you candidly that if I were you , I 'd came to Moscow now with me , and ... '
'Why ?
'But don 't let us talk about it !
Forgive me , please , if I have been rude to you , ' said Levin .
Now that he had spoken out he became once more as he had been in the morning . ' You are not angry with me , Steve ?
Please don 't be angry , ' he said smiling , and took his hand .
'Oh no , not at all ! There was nothing to be angry about .
I am glad we have had this explanation .
Should we not go ?
THOUGH VRONSKY 'S WHOLE INNER LIFE WAS ABSORBED by his passion , his external life ran unalterably and inevitably along its former customary rails of social and regimental connections and interests .
The interests of the regiment occupied an important place in his life , because he was fond of his regiment and still more because the regiment was fond of him .
Vronsky was aware of this attitude of his comrades toward him , and besides liking the life felt bound to justify their view of him .
They already prepared lumps of mud to pelt her with in due time .
Most of the older people and of those highly @-@ placed regretted this impending social scandal .
She had not seen him since his sudden departure from Moscow , and through her eldest son she sent him word to come and see her .
The elder brother was also dissatisfied with the younger .
Besides his military and social interests Vronsky had another one , namely horses , of which he was passionately fond .
On the contrary he needed an occupation and an interest apart from his love , in which to refresh himself and find rest from the impressions which agitated him too violently .
ON THE DAY OF THE KRASNOE SELO RACES Vronsky came earlier than usual to the regimental mess @-@ room to eat his beefsteak .
He sat waiting with his elbows on the table and his coat unbuttoned over a white waistcoat , and while waiting for the beefsteak he had ordered he looked at the pages of a French novel that lay on his plate .
He thought of Anna , who had promised to meet him after the races .
But he had not seen her for three days and , as her husband had returned from abroad , he did not know whether she could keep the appointment to @-@ day or not , and he did not know how to find out .
He had seen her last at his cousin Betsy 's country house .
He went to the Karenins ' country house * as seldom as possible , but now he meant to go there and was considering how to do it .
'Of course I can say that Betsy sent me to find out if she will be at the race .
Yes , of course I will go , ' he decided , lifting his eyes from the book , and a vivid sense of the joy of seeing her made his face radiant .
'Send to my house and tell them to harness three horses to the calèche at once , ' he said to the waiter who had brought him a beefsteak on a hot silver plate ; and drawing the plate nearer to him he began to eat .
Vronsky glanced at them , frowned , and , as if he had not noticed them , turned his eyes on his book and began to eat and read at the same time .
'What ? Fortifying yourself for your job ? ' asked the plump officer taking a seat beside him .
'As you see , ' said Vronsky , frowning and wiping his mouth , without looking at the speaker .
'Not afraid of getting fat ? ' said the other , turning a chair round for the young officer .
'What ? ' said Vronsky frowning , making a grimace of disgust and showing his regular teeth .
'Not afraid of getting fat ? '
'Waiter , sherry ! ' said Vronsky without replying , and moving his book to the other side of his plate he continued to read .
The plump officer took the wine @-@ list and turned to the young one . ' You choose what we shall drink , ' said he , handing him the list and looking at him .
'Suppose we have some Rhine wine , ' said the young one , turning his eyes timidly to Vronsky while his fingers tried to catch hold of his just @-@ budding moustache .
Seeing that Vronsky did not turn round , he rose .
'Let us go into the billiard @-@ room , ' he said .
The plump officer got up obediently and they made their way toward the door .
At that moment Captain Yashvin , a tall man with a fine figure , entered the room , and having given a contemptuous backward nod to the two officers he came up to Vronsky .
'Ah , here he is ! ' he exclaimed , and with his big hand gave Vronsky a sharp slap on his shoulder @-@ strap .
Vronsky looked up angrily , but his face brightened at once into its characteristic look of quiet , firm kindliness .
'That is wise , Alexis , ' said the captain in a loud baritone , ' eat now , and drink one small glass . ' 
'I don 't want to eat . ' 
'There are the inseparables , ' added Yashvin , glancing ironically at the two officers who were just going out of the room .
'Why did you not come to the Krasnensky Theatre last night ? '
'I stayed late at the Tverskoys . ' 
Yashvin , a gambler , a rake , a man not merely without principles but with bad principles , was Vronsky 's best friend in the regiment .
Vronsky respected and liked Yashvin , particularly because he felt that the latter liked him , not for his name and money but for himself .
He felt that Yashvin , though apparently despising all emotion , was the only one who could understand the power of the passion that now filled his whole life .
Vronsky did not talk to him of his love , but was aware that he knew all about it and understood it rightly , and it was pleasant to him to read this in Yashvin 's eyes .
'Ah , yes ! ' he said when he heard that Vronsky had been at the Tverskoys ; his black eyes sparkled and he began twisting his left moustache round into his mouth - a bad habit he had .
'Well , and what were you doing last night ?
'Eight thousand .
'Well , then , you can afford to lose on me , ' said Vronsky , laughing .
( Yashvin had staked heavily on Vronsky . )
The conversation turned to the forecast of the day 's race , the only subject Vronsky could now think about .
'Let us go . I have finished , ' said Vronsky , and he rose and moved toward the door .
Yashvin rose also and stretched his great legs and long back .
Here in camp also , Petritsky lived with him .
Petritsky was asleep when Vronsky and Yashvin entered .
'Get up , you 've slept enough ! ' said Yashvin , stepping behind the partition and shaking by the shoulder the dishevelled Petritsky , who lay with his nose buried in the pillow .
Petritsky suddenly sprang to his knees and looked round .
'Vodka is better than anything , ' said Yashvin in his base voice . ' Tereshchenko ! Vodka and pickled cucumbers for your master ! ' he shouted , evidently enjoying the sound of his own voice .
'Vodka , you think , eh ? ' asked Petritsky , making a face and rubbing his eyes .
'And will you have a drink ?
'To the stables , and then I have to go to Bryansky about the horses , ' said Vronsky .
He had really promised to go to Bryansky 's , who lived seven miles from Peterhof , and pay him for the horses , and he hoped to make time to call there too .
But his friends understood at once that it was not only there that he was going .
Petritsky , still singing , winked his eyes and pouted as if to say , ' We know what sort of Bryansky it is . ' 
'Mind and don 't be late ! ' was all Yashvin said , and to change the subject he asked , ' Is my roan doing well ? ' looking out of the window at the middle horse , which he had sold to Vronsky .
'Wait ! ' shouted Petritsky to Vronsky , who was already going out . ' Your brother left a letter for you and a note . Wait ! Where are they ? '
That is the question ! ' declaimed Petritsky with solemnity , moving his finger upwards from his nose .
'Come , tell me . This is stupid ! ' said Vronsky , smiling .
'Enough of this !
Where is the letter ? '
'No , really I have forgotten .
Why get angry ?
If you had emptied four bottles a head as we did last night , you would not know where you were lying .
Petritsky went behind the partition and lay down on his bed .
So I lay , and so he stood .
Here it is ! ' and Petritsky drew the letter from under the mattress where he had put it .
Vronsky took the letter and his brother 's note .
It was just what he had expected : a letter from his mother reproaching him for not having come to see her , and a note from his brother saying that they must talk things over .
Vronsky knew that it all referred to the same subject .
'What business is it of theirs ? ' thought he , and crumpling up the letters he pushed them in between the buttons of his coat , to be read more attentively on the way .
In the passage he met two officers , one of his own and one of another regiment .
Vronsky 's quarters were always the haunt of all the officers .
'I have to go to Peterhof . ' 
'Has the mare come from Tsarskoe ? '
But how will you manage to ride through such mud ? ' said the other officer .
'These are the things to restore me ! ' shouted Petritsky on seeing the new @-@ comers . The orderly stood before him with vodka and pickled cucumbers on a tray . ' Yashvin here has ordered vodka to freshen me up . ' 
'Well , you did give it us last night , ' said one of the new @-@ comers . ' You did not let us sleep all night . ' 
'Oh , but how we finished up ! ' said Petritsky . ' Volkov climbed out on to the roof and said he felt melancholy .
'Now that is reasonable !
'No , good @-@ bye , gentlemen . I am not drinking to @-@ day . ' 
'Why , because of the weight ?
Well then , we will drink by ourselves .
Let 's have seltzers and lemons . ' 
'Vronsky ! ' shouted some one as Vronsky was already leaving .
'You should have your hair cut ; it will be too heavy , especially on the top . ' 
He laughed merrily , showing his compact row of teeth , and drawing his cap over the bald patch , went out and got into the calèche .
'To the stables ! ' he said , and was taking out the letter to read , but then changed his mind , not wishing to be upset before examining his horse . ' Later will do ! ... '
THE TEMPORARY STABLE , a wooden structure , had been built close to the racecourse , and it was there his mare was to have been brought the day before .
During these last days he had not exercised her himself , but had entrusted it to the trainer , and therefore did not in the least know in what condition she had arrived or now was .
Hardly had he stepped out of the calèche before his groom , who had recognized it from a distance , had called out the trainer .
A lean Englishman in top boots and a short jacket , with only a tuft of beard left under his chin , came to meet him with the awkward gait of a jockey , swaying from side to side with his elbows sticking out .
'Well , how is Frou @-@ Frou ? ' asked Vronsky in English .
'No , I 'll go in .
'Come along , ' said the Englishman frowning and speaking as before without opening his mouth . Swaying his elbows and walking with his loose gait he led the way .
A smart , well @-@ dressed lad in a short and clean jacket , with a broom in his hand , met them and followed them .
In the shed five horses stood in the horse @-@ boxes , and Vronsky knew that his principal rival , Makhotin 's sixteen @-@ hand chestnut , Gladiator , was to have been brought that day and should be standing there too .
As he went along the passage the lad opened the second horse @-@ box to the left , and Vronsky caught sight of a big chestnut horse with white legs .
He knew it was Gladiator , but like one who avoids seeing another 's open letter , he turned and went to Frou @-@ Frou 's box .
Mak ... I never can pronounce his name , ' said the Englishman over his shoulder , pointing with his black @-@ nailed thumb to Gladiator 's box .
Yes , that is my only serious rival , ' said Vronsky .
'If you were riding him , I would back you , ' said the Englishman .
'Frou @-@ Frou is the braver , but the other is the more powerful horse , ' said Vronsky , smiling at the compliment to his riding :
'Are you quite sure that more training was unnecessary ? '
The mare is nervous , ' he added , nodding toward the closed horsebox before which they were standing , and from which was heard the trampling of hoofs among the straw .
He opened the door , and Vronsky entered the box , which was dimly lit by one small window .
In the box stood a muzzled dark @-@ bay mare stepping from foot to foot among the fresh litter .
Frou @-@ Frou was of medium size and by no means free from blemish .
She was slenderly built . Her chest , though well arched , was narrow .
Her hindquarters tapered rather too much , and her legs , especially her hind legs , were perceptibly bowed inwards .
Neither fore nor hind legs were particularly muscular , but on the other hand she was extremely broad in the girth , now that she was lean from her strict training .
Seen from the front , her canon bones were very fine and sharp , but unusually wide seen sideways .
She appeared all the more narrow in build because so deep in the breadth .
But she possessed in the highest degree a characteristic which made one forget all her defects . This was her thoroughbred quality - the kind of blood that tells , as they say in English .
The muscles , clearly marked beneath the network of sinews , stretched in the fine , mobile skin , which was smooth as satin , seemed hard as bone .
Her lean head with the prominent , bright , sparkling eyes , broadened out to her muzzle with its wide crimson nostrils .
Her whole appearance , more especially about the head , was spirited yet gentle .
She was one of those creatures who seem as if they would certainly speak if only the mechanical construction of their mouths allowed them to .
To Vronsky at any rate it seemed that she understood all he was feeling while looking at her .
'Oh , you darling ! ' said Vronsky , stepping toward the horse and soothing her .
But the nearer he came the more nervous she grew .
Only when he reached to her head did she suddenly calm down , and the muscles under her fine , delicate coat vibrated .
Vronsky stroked her firm neck , adjusted a lock of her mane that had got on to the wrong side of her sharply @-@ defined withers and brought his face close to her dilated nostrils , delicate as a bat 's wing .
Her extended nostrils loudly inhaled and exhaled her breath , and she set back one of her finely @-@ pointed ears with a start , and stretched out her black firm lips toward Vronsky , as if wishing to catch hold of his sleeve .
But remembering her muzzle she gave it a jerk , and again began stepping from one of her finely chiselled feet to the other .
'Be quiet , darling , be quiet ! ' he said , again stroking her flank , and left the box with a joyful conviction that the horse was in the very best condition .
The mare 's excitement had communicated itself to Vronsky . He felt that the blood was rushing to his heart , and that he , like the horse , wished to move and to bite ; it was both frightening and joyful .
'Well then , I rely on you , ' said Vronsky to the Englishman . ' You will be on the spot at half @-@ past six . ' 
'All right , ' said the Englishman . ' And where are you going , my lord ? ' he asked unexpectedly , addressing him as ' my lord , ' which he hardly ever did .
Vronsky raised his head in amazement and looked as he knew how to , not into the Englishman 's eyes but at his forehead , surprised at the boldness of the question .
'How often have I been asked that question to @-@ day ? ' he thought , and blushed , a thing he rarely did .
The Englishman looked at him attentively and , as if he knew where he was going , added :
'The chief thing before a race is to keep cool : don 't be put out or upset . ' 
'All right , ' said Vronsky smiling , and jumping into the calèche , he told the coachman to drive to Peterhof .
He had not gone many yards before the clouds , which had been threatening since morning , broke , and there was a downpour of rain .
'This is bad ! ' thought Vronsky , raising the hood of the calèche . ' It was muddy before , but now it will be a swamp . ' 
Sitting alone in the closed chalice he drew out his mother 's letter and his brother 's note and read them through .
Yes , it was the same thing over and over again .
They all , his mother and his brother and everybody , considered it necessary to interfere with his intimate affairs .
This interference roused him to anger , a feeling he rarely experienced .
Why does everybody consider it his duty to look after me ?
If it were an ordinary empty Society intrigue they would let me alone .
They feel that it is something different , that it is not a game , and that this woman is dearer to me than life .
That is incomprehensible , and therefore it vexes them .
They have no conception of what happiness is , and they do not know that without love there is no happiness or unhappiness for us , for there would be no life , ' he thought .
He was angry with everybody for their interference , just because he felt in his soul that they were right .
He felt that the love that united him with Anna was not momentary infatuation , which would pass , as Society intrigues do , without leaving any trace in the lives of the one or the other except pleasant or disagreeable memories .
And he experienced a strange feeling which since his union with Anna sometimes overcame him .
It was a feeling of revulsion against something , against Karenin , or against himself or against the whole world - he hardly knew which .
But he always drove away this strange feeling .
'Yes , formerly she was unhappy , but proud and calm ; but now she cannot be calm and dignified , though she still seems so .
Yes , this must be brought to an end , ' he decided .
And for the first time the clear idea occurred to him that it was necessary to put an end to all this falsehood , and the sooner the better .
'Throw up everything and let us two conceal ourselves somewhere alone with our love , ' said he to himself .
Hoping to find her alone , Vronsky , as usual , to attract less attention , alighted before crossing the little bridge that led to the house and walked on .
He did not go straight to the entrance from the street but passed through the yard .
'Has your master returned ? ' he asked a gardener .
Go in at the front door ; the servants are there and will open it , ' replied the man .
Vronsky had now forgotten all his thoughts on the way , about the hardness and difficulty of his situation .
He only thought that he would see her immediately , not merely in fancy , but alive , all of her - as she was in reality .
That boy was a more frequent hindrance to their relations than anyone else .
They had not arranged this , but it had come about of itself .
They would have considered it unworthy of themselves to deceive that child .
In his presence they talked as acquaintances .
It was as if the child felt that between that man and his mother there was some important relation which he could not understand .
And the boy really felt that he could not understand this relation . He tried but could not make out what he ought to feel toward this man .
'What does it mean ?
Who is he ?
How should I love him ?
The presence of that child always aroused in Vronsky that strange feeling of unreasoning revulsion which had of late come to him .
This child with his naive outlook on life was the compass which showed them their degree of divergence from what they knew , but would not recognize , as the right course .
This time Serezha was not at home , and Anna was quite alone , sitting on the verandah waiting for the return of her son , who had gone for a walk and had been caught in the rain .
She had sent a man and a maidservant to look for him and sat waiting .
She wore a white dress trimmed with wide embroidery , and as she sat in a corner of the verandah behind some plants , did not hear Vronsky coming .
Bowing her curly head she pressed her forehead against a cold watering @-@ can that stood on the balustrade , and both her beautiful hands , with the rings he knew so well , were holding the can .
The beauty of her whole figure , her head , her neck , and her arms , always struck Vronsky with new surprise .
He stopped , gazing at her with rapture .
But just as he was going to step toward her , she felt his nearness , pushed away the can , and turned her hot face toward him .
Aren 't you well ? ' he said in French as he came up to her .
He wished to run toward her , but remembering that there might be others near , turned to look at the verandah door and blushed , as he always did when he felt that he had reason to fear and to be circumspect .
'No , I am quite well , ' she said , rising and firmly pressing his outstretched hand . ' I did not expect you . ' 
'Oh , heavens ! What cold hands ! ' he said .
'You frightened me , ' she said . ' I am alone and was expecting Serezha . He went for a walk ; they will return this way . ' 
But though she tried to be calm her lips trembled .
'Why " forgive " ?
'But you are ill or in trouble , ' he continued without releasing her hand , but bending over it . ' What were you thinking about ? '
'Always about the same thing , ' she said with a smile .
Whenever , - at whatever moment , - she was asked what she was thinking about she could have answered without fail , ' Always about my happiness and my unhappiness . ' 
For certain reasons this thought troubled her more particularly to @-@ day .
Vronsky answered her , and noticing that she was excited , in order to distract her thoughts began giving her in a very matter @-@ of @-@ fact way particulars of the preparations for the races .
'But you have not told me what you were thinking about when I came in , ' he said , breaking off his narration .
She did not answer , but , slightly bowing her head , looked at him from under her brows questioningly , her eyes shining from under their long lashes .
Her hand , toying with a leaf that she had pulled off , trembled .
He noticed this , and his face assumed that submissive , slavishly @-@ devoted expression that had such an effect on Anna .
'I see that something has happened .
How can I be a moment at peace knowing that you have some sorrow which I am not sharing ?
'I cannot forgive him if he does not understand all the importance of it .
Better not tell him , - why put him to the proof ? ' she thought , continuing to look at him in the same way and feeling that her hand with the leaf was trembling more and more .
'Shall I ? '
The leaf in her hand shook still more violently , but she did not move her eyes from his face , watching to see how he would take it .
He grew pale , tried to say something , but stopped , dropped her hand , and bowed his head .
'Yes , he understands its full significance , ' she thought , and gratefully pressed his hand .
But she was mistaken in thinking that he understood the importance of the news as she , a woman , understood it .
But , besides this , her physical agitation communicated itself to him .
He gave her a look full of emotion , humbly kissed her hand , rose , and began silently pacing up and down the verandah .
'Yes , ' he said , resolutely approaching her . ' Neither you nor I looked on our union as an amusement , and now our fate is sealed .
We must end ' - he went on , looking round - ' this falsehood in which we are living . ' 
'End it ?
How are we to end it , Alexis ? ' she said softly .
She was quiet now and her face shone with a tender smile .
'They are united already , ' she replied in a scarcely audible tone .
'Yes , but entirely . ' 
'But how , Alexis , teach me how ? ' she said with pathetic irony at the inevitability of her position . ' Is there any escape from such a position ?
'There is a way out of every position .
One has to take a decision , ' he said . ' Anything would be better than the condition in which you are living .
Don 't I see how suffer from everything - Society , your son , and your husband ? '
'Oh , but not through my husband , ' she said with natural irony . ' I don 't know him and don 't think about him .
'You are not speaking sincerely .
You suffer from him too . ' 
But to @-@ day he decided to speak out .
'Whether he knows or not , ' said Vronsky in his usual firm , calm tone , ' that is not our business . We cannot ...
You cannot remain as you are , especially now . ' 
'What would you have me do ? ' she asked with the same light irony .
She who had so feared that he might take her pregnancy too lightly now felt vexed that he deduced therefrom the necessity of doing something .
'Tell him everything , leave him . ' 
'Very well ; suppose I do so ! ' she said . ' Do you know what the result will be ?
And he will do what he says , quietly and accurately .
'What then , run away ? '
'And why not run away ?
And not on my account , - I see that you suffer . ' 
'Yes , run away , and for me to live as your mistress , ' she said maliciously .
'Anna , ' he murmured with reproachful tenderness .
'Yes , ' she continued . ' Become your mistress and ruin my ... everything . ' 
She was again going to say ' son ' but could not utter the word .
'I beg you , I entreat you , ' said she suddenly in quite an altered tone , sincerely and tenderly , taking him by the hand , ' never to speak to me about that ! '
I know all the degradation , all the horror of my position ; but it is not so easy to settle the matter as you think .
Leave it to me and listen to me .
Never speak to me about it .
'I promise everything , but I cannot be at peace , especially after what you have told me .
I cannot be at peace when you are not . ' 
'I ? ' she said . ' Yes , I do suffer sometimes ; but it will pass if you never speak to me about it .
It is only when you speak to me about it that I suffer . ' 
'I don 't understand ... ' said he .
'I know , ' she interrupted him , ' how hard it is for your honest nature to lie and I pity you .
I often think how you have ruined your life because of me . ' 
'I was just thinking the same , ' he said ; ' wondering how you could sacrifice everything for my sake .
I cannot forgive myself for your unhappiness . ' 
'I unhappy ? ' she said , drawing near to him and gazing at him with a smile of rapturous love . ' I am like a hungry man to whom food has been given .
He may be cold , his clothes may be ragged , and he may be ashamed , but he is not unhappy .
No , this is my happiness ... '
But she heard the voice of her son approaching , and glancing quickly round the verandah she rose hurriedly .
'When ? ' he whispered , gazing rapturously at her .
'To @-@ night at one , ' she whispered , and with her quick light step went to meet her son .
'Well , au revoir , ' she said to Vronsky . ' It will soon be time to start for the races .
Vronsky looked at his watch and hurried away .
WHEN VRONSKY LOOKED AT HIS WATCH on the Karenins ' verandah he was so agitated and so preoccupied that he saw the hands and face of the watch without realizing the time .
He went to the high road , stepping carefully over the mud , and made his way to his calèche .
He was so full of his feeling for Anna that he did not consider what o 'clock it was or whether he still had time to call on Bryansky .
He only retained , as often happens , the external capacity of memory which indicated what he had decided to do next .
Only after going some five miles did he recollect himself sufficiently to look at his watch and to realize that it was already half @-@ past five , and that he was late .
He could be in time for his own race , but , if he called on Bryansky first he could only just manage it , and the whole Court would already be at the racecourse .
But he had promised Bryansky to call and therefore he decided to go on , telling the coachman not to spare the horses .
He saw Bryansky , stayed with him five minutes , and drove back at a gallop .
This quick drive soothed him .
When he reached his quarters he found no one there - they had all gone to the races and his valet was waiting at the gate .
While he was changing his things , the valet told him that the second race had already begun and that many gentlemen had been to inquire for him , and a lad had run over twice from the stables .
Having changed without hurrying ( he never hurried or lost his self @-@ control ) , Vronsky ordered the coachman to drive him to the stables .
From there he could see the sea of carriages , pedestrians , and soldiers surrounding the racecourse , and the stands , which were thronged with people .
Probably the second race was just taking place , for as he entered the stables he heard the bell ring .
On his way he met Makhotin 's white @-@ legged chestnut Gladiator , which in a blue @-@ bordered orange covering , with his ears looking enormous in their blue @-@ trimmed cloth , was being led to the course .
'Where is Cord ? ' he asked the groom .
'In the stables , saddling . ' 
In her open box Frou @-@ Frou stood ready saddled .
Vronsky once again glanced at the beautiful fascinating shape of the mare , whose whole body was trembling , and tearing himself with difficulty from this sight he left the shed .
He came toward the pavilions at the very best time to avoid attracting anyone 's attention .
The gelding , planting its feet with effort , reduced the speed of its enormous body , and the guards ' officer , like one waking from deep sleep , looked round and forced himself to smile .
Vronsky purposely avoided the select and fashionable crowd which moved and chatted with restrained freedom in front of the pavilions .
He ascertained that Anna , Betsy , and his brother 's wife were there , but in order not to agitate himself , intentionally avoided going near them .
But he continually met acquaintances who stopped him , told him about the races that had been run , and asked him why he was so late .
'Did you get my note ? ' he asked . ' One can never find you . ' 
Alexander Vronsky , despite the loose and , in particular , drunken life for which he was noted , was quite a courtier .
'I received it , but really do not understand what you are worrying about , ' replied Alexis .
'I am worrying because people have just remarked to me that you were not here and that you were seen in Peterhof last Monday . ' 
'There are things which should be discussed only by those who are directly interested , and the matter you are concerning yourself about is one ... '
'I beg you not to interfere , that is all . ' 
Alexis Vronsky 's frowning face turned pale , and his prominent lower jaw twitched , a thing that rarely happened to him .
Being a very kind @-@ hearted man he seldom got angry , but when he did , and when his chin twitched , then he was dangerous , as Alexander Vronsky knew .
Alexander smiled gaily .
'I only wanted to deliver mother 's letter .
Answer her , and don 't upset yourself before the race .
Bonne chance ! ' he added smiling and went away .
But just then another friendly greeting stopped Vronsky .
'Won 't you recognize your friends ?
'Come to the mess @-@ room to @-@ morrow , ' said Vronsky , and apologetically pressing the sleeve of Oblonsky 's overcoat , he went to the centre of the racecourse where the horses were already being led out for the steeplechase .
To the right the slender and beautiful Frou @-@ Frou was being led up and down , stepping as on springs with her rather long elastic pasterns .
The large , beautiful , perfectly regular shape of the horse , with his wonderful hindquarters and his exceptionally short pasterns just above his hoofs , involuntarily arrested Vronsky 's attention .
He wished to go up to his own horse , but was again stopped by an acquaintance .
'Ah , there is Karenin ! ' said the acquaintance with whom he was talking . ' He is looking for his wife , and she is in the centre of the pavilion .
'No , I have not , ' said Vronsky , and without even glancing at the pavilion where Anna was pointed out to him , he went to his horse .
He had not had time to examine the saddle , about which he wished to give some directions , when the riders were summoned to the pavilion to draw their numbers and places .
With serious , stern , and in many cases pale faces , seventeen officers assembled at the pavilion and drew their numbers .
The order was given : ' Mount ! '
Feeling that he and the other riders were the centre toward which all eyes were turned , Vronsky , in the highly @-@ strung state which generally made his movements calm and deliberate , approached his horse .
Cord , in honour of the races , was dressed in his best clothes : a black buttoned @-@ up coat , a stiff starched collar that pressed against his cheeks , a bowler hat , and top boots .
He was calm and important as usual , and standing in front of the horse , was himself holding both its reins .
Her fiery eyes turned on the approaching Vronsky .
Vronsky pushed his fingers under the girths .
The Englishman puckered his lip , wishing to express a smile at anyone testing his saddling .
Vronsky glanced round at his rivals for the last time .
Two of them were already riding toward the starting @-@ point .
Galtsin , one of the formidable competitors and a friend of Vronsky 's , was struggling with a sorrel gelding that would not let him mount .
A short hussar in tight riding @-@ breeches was galloping along bunched up like a cat in his desire to imitate an English jockey .
Prince Kusovlev sat pale @-@ faced on his thoroughbred mare from the Grabov stud farm , which an Englishman was leading by the bridle .
Vronsky and all his set knew Kusovlev and his peculiarities , which were weak nerves and terrible vanity .
Their eyes met and Vronsky winked at him kindly and approvingly .
The only one Vronsky did not see was his chief rival Makhotin on his Gladiator .
'Don 't hurry , ' said Cord to Vronsky , ' and remember one thing : do not hold back or urge on your horse at an obstacle . Let her have her way . ' 
'Very well , very well , ' said Vronsky taking the reins .
'Lead if you can , but do not despair till the last moment if you are behind . ' 
The mare had not time to stir before Vronsky with a powerful and agile movement put his foot in the notched steel stirrup and seated himself lightly but firmly on the creaking leather of the saddle .
Having got his right foot also in its stirrup he straightened out the double reins between his practised fingers , and Cord removed his hand .
As if not knowing which foot to step on first , Frou @-@ Frou stretched the reins with her long neck , and started as if on springs , shaking her rider on her flexible back .
The restive horse tugged at the reins , now to one side , now to the other , trying to deceive her rider , and Vronsky vainly sought by voice and hand to soothe her .
They were already approaching the dammed @-@ up stream on their way to the starting @-@ post .
Some of the riders were in front , some behind , when Vronsky suddenly heard a horse galloping through the mud behind him , and Makhotin on his white @-@ legged , large @-@ eared Gladiator went past him .
Makhotin smiled , showing his long teeth , but Vronsky looked at him angrily .
Vronsky always disliked him and now considered him his most dangerous rival , and he was vexed with him for galloping past and so exciting Frou @-@ Frou .
She broke into a canter , gave two leaps , and , angry at the tightened rein , changed back into a jerky trot , jolting her rider .
Cord also frowned , following Vronsky almost at a run .
It was to take place on the large four @-@ verst elliptical course in front of the pavilion .
Three times the riders drew up in line , but each time someone 's horse made a false start and they had to line up again .
Colonel Sestrin , an expert starter , was already getting angry , but at last , at the fourth try , he shouted ' Go ! ' and the race began .
All eyes and all glasses were turned on the bright group of riders while they were getting into line .
'They have started !
They are off ! ' was heard from every side after the hush of expectation ..
Lookers @-@ on , in groups or singly , started running from place to place to get a better view .
In the first minute the group of riders began to stretch out and could be seen in twos and threes , and one behind another , approaching the brook .
It had looked to the public as if they had all started together , but the riders were aware of a difference of seconds which to them were of great importance .
In the first moments Vronsky was master neither of himself nor of his mare .
Up to the first obstacle , the brook , he could not control her movements .
These particulars Vronsky learned later , now he only saw that Diana 's head or legs might come just where Frou @-@ Frou had to alight .
But Frou @-@ Frou , like a falling cat , made an effort with her legs and back while in the air , and clearing the other horse rushed on .
'Oh , you darling ! ' thought Vronsky .
After crossing the brook Vronsky had the mare quite under control , and held her in , intending to cross the big barrier behind Makhotin and then to try and pass him on the flat 300 yards before the next obstacle .
The big barrier was right in front of the Imperial Pavilion .
The Emperor , the whole Court , and crowds of people were all looking at them - at him and at Makhotin , who was a full length ahead of him when they approached the Devil ( as the solid barrier was called ) .
Gladiator rose without touching anything , swished his short tail , and disappeared from Vronsky 's sight .
'Bravo ! ' shouted a single voice .
Just then the boards of the barrier flashed close before Vronsky 's eyes .
Without the least change in her action his mare rose under him ; the boards disappeared , only behind him there was a knock .
But her pace did not change , and Vronsky , hit in the face by a lump of mud , realized that he was again at the same distance behind Gladiator .
He again saw before him that horse 's hind @-@ quarters , short tail and flashing white legs , no farther away ,
Vronsky had just time to think of coming up on the outside , when Frou @-@ Frou changed her legs and started to do so .
Frou @-@ Frou 's shoulder , which was already growing dark with sweat , was on a level with Gladiator 's hind @-@ quarters .
They ran side by side for a few strides , but before the obstacle they were approaching , Vronsky , not to lose ground , gave the mare her head and just on the declivity passed Makhotin .
He caught sight of his mud @-@ bespattered face , and even thought he saw him smile .
He passed , but felt that Makhotin was close behind him , and continually heard just behind his back the regular beating of hoofs and the short , still fresh breathing of Gladiator 's nostrils .
The next two obstacles , a ditch and a fence , were easily passed , but Vronsky heard Gladiator galloping and snorting closer .
He urged on his mare and felt with joy that she easily increased her speed , and he heard the sound of Gladiator 's hoofs again at the former distance behind .
Vronsky now had the lead , as he had wished and as Cord had advised , and he was confident of success .
His excitement and joy , and his tenderness for Frou @-@ Frou , grew stronger and stronger .
There remained the most difficult obstacle ; if he crossed it ahead of the others , he would come in first .
He was galloping up to the Irish bank .
He and Frou @-@ Frou both saw the bank while still some way off , and to both of them came a momentary doubt .
'Bravo , Vronsky ! ' he heard the voices of a knot of people he knew - friends of his regiment who were standing by this obstacle . He could not fail to recognize Yashvin 's voice , though he did not see him .
'Oh , my beauty ! ' he thought of Frou @-@ Frou , as he listened to what was happening behind .
'He is over it ! ' he thought , as he heard Gladiator again galloping behind him .
There remained one last water jump , only a yard and a half wide .
Vronsky did not even look at it , but hoping to win by a distance , began working the reins with a circular movement , raising and dropping the mare 's head in time with her stride .
But he knew that her reserve of strength was more than enough for the remaining five hundred yards .
It was only by feeling himself nearer to the ground and by the smoothness of the pace that Vronsky knew how much the mare had increased her speed .
He himself , without knowing it , had made the unpardonable mistake of dropping back in his saddle and pulling up her head .
Before he could realize this , the white legs of the gelding flashed close by him and Makhotin passed at a rapid gallop .
But he only understood this much later .
Still not understanding what had happened , Vronsky pulled at the reins .
The mare again began to struggle like a fish , causing the flaps of the saddle to creak ; she got her front legs free , but unable to lift her hind @-@ quarters , struggled and immediately again fell on her side .
'Ah , ah , ah ! ' groaned Vronsky , seizing his head . ' Ah ! what have I done ? ' he exclaimed .
And this dear , unfortunate mare ruined !
Ah ! what have I done ! '
Onlookers , a doctor , an attendant , and officers of his regiment ran toward him .
To his regret he felt that he was himself sound and unhurt .
The mare had broken her back , and it was decided to shoot her .
Vronsky was unable to reply to questions or to speak to anyone .
He turned away and , without picking up the cap that had fallen from his head , left the racecourse without knowing where he was going .
For the first time in his life he experienced the worst kind of misfortune - one that was irretrievable , and caused by his own fault .
Yashvin overtook him with his cap and led him home , and in half an hour Vronsky came to himself .
But the memory of that steeplechase long remained the most painful and distressing memory of his life .
EXTERNALLY KARENIN 'S RELATIONS with his wife remained as before .
The only difference was that he was even more occupied than before .
And as usual his wife had moved to the country house while he remained in Petersburg .
He was rather colder toward her .
He appeared only to be slightly dissatisfied with her for that first night 's talk which she had evaded .
In his behaviour to her there was a shade of vexation , but nothing more .
'You did not wish to have an explanation , ' he seemed to say to her in imagination , ' so much the worse for you .
Now you will ask me to explain. and I shall not do so .
He who was so wise and astute in official affairs did not realize the insanity of such an attitude toward his wife .
He who had been a considerate father , since the end of that winter had become particularly cold toward his son , and treated him in the same bantering manner as he did his wife .
'Ah , young man ! ' was the way in which he addressed him .
That was why Karenin 's face bore a stern , proud expression when anyone asked about his wife 's health .
He did not wish to think about his wife 's conduct and feelings at all , and he really did not think about them .
The country house the Karenins regularly occupied in summer was in Peterhof , and generally the Countess Lydia Ivanovna also lived near by and was in constant touch with Anna .
That year the Countess Lydia Ivanovna refused to live in Peterhof , did not once come to see Anna , and hinted to Karenin the undesirability of Anna 's intimacy with Betsy and Vronsky .
Karenin stopped her severely , expressing the opinion that his wife was above suspicion , and from that time began to avoid the Countess .
Since his return from abroad Karenin had been twice at the country house .
Once he dined there , and the other time he spent an evening with some visitors , but he had not once stayed the night , as he used to do in former years .
He would call on his wife , because he had decided to do so once a week for the sake of propriety .
Besides , he had that day to give her money for her expenses , due according to their custom by the fifteenth of each month .
Having with the mental control habitual to him considered these matters concerning his wife , he did not allow his thoughts to run on further about her .
He had a very busy morning .
On the previous day the Countess Lydia Ivanovna had sent him a pamphlet by a celebrated traveller in China , and a letter asking him to receive this traveller , who for various reasons was very interesting and necessary to them .
The latter did not keep him long .
But the doctor , a celebrated Petersburg physician who was on friendly terms with Karenin , took up a good deal of time .
Karenin had not expected him to @-@ day and was surprised to see him , and yet more surprised that the doctor questioned him very particularly about his state of health , sounding his chest and tapping and feeling his liver .
Karenin did not know that his friend Lydia Ivanovna , having noticed that he was not in good health that summer , had asked the doctor to go and see his patient .
'Do it for my sake , ' the Countess Lydia Ivanovna had said .
'I will do it for the sake of Russia , Countess , ' replied the doctor .
'Dear man ! ' the Countess Lydia Ivanovna had exclaimed .
In the porch , after leaving Karenin , the doctor met Slyudin , Karenin 's private secretary , whom he knew very well .
They had been at the University together , and though they very seldom met , they respected one another and were good friends , and to no one but Slyudin would the doctor have expressed his opinion about his patient .
'I am very glad you have been to see him , ' said Slyudin . ' He is not well , and I believe that ...
At the same time as the traveller , a provincial Marshal of the Nobility was announced with whom Karenin had some things to talk over .
When he too had left , he had to finish his everyday business with his private secretary and had also to drive to see an important personage on a grave and serious matter .
He only managed to get back at five , his dinner @-@ time , and having dined with his private secretary , he invited the latter to drive with him to his country house and to go to the races with him .
Without acknowledging it to himself , Karenin now looked out for opportunities of having a third person present at his interviews with his wife .
'It is too early for Betsy , ' she thought , and glancing out of the window she saw the carriage , and sticking out of it a black hat and Karenin 's familiar ears . ' How unfortunate !
'Oh , I will not separate the inseparables , ' he said in his usual facetious tone . ' I will go with Slyudin .
The doctors have ordered me to walk .
I will walk part way and imagine that I am still taking the waters . ' 
'There is no hurry , ' said Anna . ' Would you like some tea ? ' She rang .
'Tea , please , and tell Serezha that his father is here .
You have not been here before ; look how pretty my verandah is , ' she went on , turning now to her husband , now to Slyudin .
She spoke very simply and naturally , but too much and too fast .
She felt this herself , especially as by the inquisitive way Slyudin looked at her she noticed that he seemed to be watching her .
Slyudin immediately went out on to the verandah and she sat down by her husband .
'You are not looking quite well , ' she said .
'No , ' he replied , ' the doctor came to see me this morning and robbed me of an hour .
I feel that some friend of mine must have sent him : my health is so precious ... '
She said all this lightly , rapidly , and with peculiarly sparkling eyes ; but Karenin did not now attach any importance to this tone of hers .
He only heard her words , and gave them only their direct meaning .
And he answered simply , though jokingly .
In all this conversation nothing particular passed , but never afterwards could Anna recall this short scene without being tormented by shame .
Serezha came in , preceded by his governess .
Had Karenin allowed himself to observe , he would have noticed the timid , confused look which the child cast first at his father and then at his mother .
But he did not want to see , and did not see , anything .
He has grown .
He is really getting quite a man .
He looked round at his mother , as if asking for protection .
Only with his mother he felt at ease .
Karenin meanwhile talked to the governess with his hand on his son 's shoulder , and Serezha felt so extremely uncomfortable that Anna saw he was about to cry .
'No , I don 't ... Yes , I do , ' she replied without looking at him , and blushing to the roots of her hair . ' But I suppose you will call here after the races . ' 
'What elegance !
The Princess Tverskaya did not get out , only her footman in his black hat , cape , and gaiters jumped down at the front door .
'I am going , good @-@ bye ! ' said Anna , and giving her son a kiss she went up to Karenin and held out her hand to him . ' You were very kind to come . ' 
Karenin kissed her hand .
You will come back for tea , that is right ! ' she said , and went out beaming and gay .
But as soon as she ceased to see him she became conscious of the place on her hand his lips had touched and shuddered with disgust .
WHEN KARENIN APPEARED at the racecourse Anna was already sitting beside Betsy in the Grand Stand : the stand where all the highest Society was assembled .
Two men - her husband and her lover - were the two centres of her life , and without the aid of her senses she was aware of the presence of either .
From afar she already felt the approach of her husband , and involuntarily watched him amid the surging crowd through which he was moving .
She knew all these ways of his and they were all repulsive to her .
He smiled his usual cold smile .
'There is so much splendour here that my eyes are dazzled , ' he replied , and approached the stand .
With him Karenin entered into conversation .
There was an interval between two races , so that nothing hindered the conversation .
Karenin replied , defending them .
Anna heard his high measured voice and did not miss a single word . Each word seemed to her false and grated painfully on her ear .
When the four @-@ verst steeplechase was beginning she leaned forward , and did not take her eyes off Vronsky while he went up to his horse and mounted it , and at the same time she heard her husband 's repulsive , unceasing voice .
She was tormented by anxiety for Vronsky , but suffered even more from what seemed to her the incessant flow of her husband 's shrill voice with its familiar intonations .
'I am a bad woman , a ruined woman , ' she thought , ' but I dislike lies . I cannot stand falsehood , but his food is falsehood .
He knows everything , sees everything - what then does he feel , if he can talk so calmly ?
But no , lies and propriety is all he cares about , ' said Anna to herself , without considering what she really wanted of her husband or what she would have liked him to be .
Nor did she understand that Karenin 's peculiar volubility , which so irritated her , was only an expression of the anxiety and unrest within him .
And as it is natural for the child to skip about , so it was natural for him to speak cleverly and well .
'The danger in military , that is , cavalry , steeplechases is an unavoidable element of the racing .
If England can point to the most brilliant cavalry charges in military history , it is entirely due to the fact that she has historically developed this capacity in her men and horses .
Sport in my opinion has great value , but we , as usual , see only what is most external . ' 
'Not external at all , ' said the Princess Tverskaya .
Karenin smiled his usual smile , which showed his teeth but expressed nothing .
'Granted , Princess , ' said he , ' that that is not external but internal .
It is directly involved in their military duty .
'No , I shan 't come again ; it excites me too much , ' said the Princess Betsy . ' Don 't you think so , Anna ? '
'It is exciting , but one cannot tear oneself away , ' said another lady . ' If I had been a Roman , I should never have missed a gladiatorial show . ' 
Interrupting his speech , Karenin rose hurriedly , but with dignity , and bowed low to this general .
'You are not racing , ' said the latter to him jokingly .
'My race is a harder one , ' replied Karenin respectfully .
And though the answer did not mean anything , the general made as though he had heard a clever reply from a clever man , and quite appreciated la pointe de la sauce . ' 
'There are two sides to it , ' continued Karenin , ' that of the performers and that of the spectators . The love of such spectacles is the surest proof of low development in the onlookers , I admit , but ... '
'Princess , a bet ! ' came the voice of Oblonsky from below , addressing Betsy . ' Whom are you backing ? '
'Anna and I are betting on Kuzovlev , ' replied Betsy .
'And I on Vronsky .
Karenin was silent while others were speaking near him , but began again immediately .
'I agree that unmanly sports ... ' he was continuing .
But at that moment the race began and all conversation ceased .
Karenin was silent too , as everybody rose and turned their eyes toward the stream .
Karenin was not interested in races and therefore did not watch the riders , but began absent @-@ mindedly looking at the spectators with his weary eyes .
Her face was pale and stern .
He looked at her and hurriedly turned away , scrutinizing other faces .
'Yes , that lady - and those others - are very excited too ; it is quite natural , ' he said to himself .
He did not wish to look at her , but his eyes were involuntarily drawn toward her .
He again watched her face , trying not to read what was so plainly written on it , but against his will he read in it with horror that which he did not want to know .
The first fall - Kuzovlev 's at the stream - excited every one , but Karenin saw clearly by Anna 's pale , triumphant face that he whom she was watching had not fallen .
He looked at her more and more often , and more intently .
She glanced for an instant at him with a look of inquiry , and , slightly frowning , turned away again .
'Oh , I don 't care , ' she seemed to say to him , and then did not once look at him again .
The steeplechase was unlucky : more than half of the seventeen officers were thrown and hurt .
By the end of the race every one was disturbed , and this disturbance was increased by the fact that the Emperor was displeased .
But afterwards a change came over Anna 's face which was positively improper .
She began to flutter like a captive bird , now rising to go , now addressing Betsy .
But Betsy did not hear her .
She was leaning over to speak to a General who was below .
Karenin approached Anna and politely offered her his arm . ' Come , if you like , ' he said in French ; but Anna listened to what the General was saying and did not notice her husband .
'He too has broken his leg , they say . It 's too bad , ' the General said .
Anna , without replying to her husband , raised her glasses and looked toward the spot where Vronsky had fallen ; but it was so far off , and so many people had crowded there , that it was impossible to distinguish anything .
She put down her glasses and was about to go ; but at that moment an officer galloped up and reported something to the Emperor .
Anna bent forward to listen .
But he did not hear her .
'I again offer you my arm if you wish to go , ' said her husband , touching her arm .
With a look of repulsion she drew back , and without looking at him replied :
'No , no , leave me alone , I shall stay here . ' 
She now saw an officer running to the Grand Stand from the place where Vronsky had fallen .
The officer brought the news that the rider was unhurt but that the horse had broken its back .
On hearing this Anna quickly sat down and hid her face behind her fan .
Karenin saw that she was crying , and that she was unable to keep back either her tears or the sobs that made her bosom heave .
He stepped forward so as to screen her , giving her time to recover .
'For the third time I offer you my arm , ' he said after a while , turning toward her .
The Princess Betsy came to her aid .
'No , Alexis Alexandrovich , ' she put in , ' I brought Anna here and I have promised to take her back again . ' 
'Excuse me , Princess , ' he said , smiling politely but looking her firmly in the eyes , ' but I see that Anna is not very well , and I wish her to come with me . ' 
'I will send to him and find out , and will let you know , ' Betsy whispered to her .
'Is he hurt or not ?
Shall I see him to @-@ night ? ' she thought .
In spite of all he had seen , Karenin would still not allow himself to think of his wife 's real position .
He only saw the external sights .
He saw that she had behaved with impropriety and he considered it his duty to tell her so .
But it was very difficult for him to say that and nothing more .
He opened his mouth to say that she had behaved improperly , but involuntarily said something quite different .
'After all , how inclined we all are to these cruel spectacles , ' he said . ' I notice ... '
'What ? I do not understand , ' said Anna contemptuously .
He was offended and at once began to tell her what he wanted to .
'I must tell you ... ' he said .
'I must tell you that you behaved improperly to @-@ day , ' he said in French .
'Don 't forget , ' said he to her , pointing at the open window behind the coachman 's box ; and , slightly rising , he lifted the window .
'What did you consider improper ? ' she asked again .
'The despair you were unable to conceal when one of the riders fell . ' 
'I asked you once before to conduct yourself in Society so that evil tongues might be unable to say anything against you .
There was a time when I spoke about inner relations ; now I do not speak of them .
I speak now of external relations .
Your conduct was improper and I do not wish it to occur again . ' 
She did not hear half that he said , but felt afraid of him and wondered whether it was true that Vronsky was not hurt .
She only smiled with simulated irony when he had finished ; and she did not reply because she had not heard what he said .
Karenin had begun to speak boldly but when he realized clearly what he was talking about the fear she was experiencing communicated itself to him .
He saw her smile and a strange delusion possessed him .
'She smiles at my suspicions .
In a moment she will tell me what she told me then : that these suspicions are groundless and ridiculous . ' 
Now that a complete disclosure was impending , he expected nothing so much as that she would , as before , answer him mockingly that his suspicions were ridiculous and groundless .
What he knew was so terrible that he was now prepared to believe anything .
But the expression of her frightened and gloomy face did not now even promise deception .
'Perhaps I am mistaken , ' said he . ' In that case I beg your pardon . ' 
'No , you were not mistaken , ' she said slowly , looking despairingly into his cold face . ' You were not mistaken .
I was , and cannot help being , in despair .
I listen to you but I am thinking of him .
Do what you like to me . ' 
As they were driving up to it , he turned his face to her still with the same expression and said :
But I demand that the external conditions of propriety shall be observed till ' - his voice trembled - ' till I take measures to safeguard my honour and inform you of them . ' 
He alighted first and helped her out .
In the presence of the servants he pressed her hand , re @-@ entered the carriage , and drove off toward Petersburg .
After he had gone the Princess Betsy 's footman brought Anna a note .
'I sent to Alexis to inquire about his health . He writes that he is safe and sound , but in despair . ' 
'Then he will come , ' thought she . ' What a good thing it is that I spoke out . ' 
'Dear me , how light it is !
It is dreadful , but I love to see his face , and I love this fantastic light ...
'Fürst Shcherbatsky sammt Gemahlin und Tochter , ' [ Prince Shcherbatsky with his wife and daughter . ] by the premises they occupied , by their name , and by the people they were acquainted with , at once crystallized into their definite and preordained place .
Kitty made a low and graceful curtsy in her very simple dress - that is to say , very stylish summer gown ordered from Paris .
The Royal Princess said : ' I hope the roses will soon return to this pretty little face , ' and at once a definite path was firmly established for the Shcherbatskys from which it was impossible to deviate .
They made acquaintance with the family of an English ' Lady , ' with a German Countess and her son who had been wounded in the last war , with a Swedish savant and with a Mr. Canut and his sister .
When all this had become firmly established , Kitty began to feel very dull , especially as her father had gone to Carlsbad and she was left alone with her mother .
She was not interested in the people she knew , for she felt that nothing new would come from them .
Her chief private interest at the watering @-@ place consisted in observing those whom she did not know and making conjectures about them .
It was a characteristic of Kitty 's always to expect to find the most excellent qualities in people , especially in those she did not know .
Among these people she was specially interested in a young Russian girl who had come to the watering @-@ place with an invalid Russian lady , Madame Stahl , as every one called her .
Madame Stahl belonged to the highest Society , but she was so ill that she could not walk , and only on fine days occasionally appeared on the promenade in a bath @-@ chair .
But not so much from illness as from pride , as the Princess Shcherbatskaya explained - Madame Stahl was not acquainted with any of the Russians there .
The Russian girl looked after Madame Stahl , and also , as Kitty noticed , became intimate with all those who were seriously ill ( of whom there were many in the place ) and waited on them in the most natural way .
This Russian girl , Kitty decided , was not related to Madame Stahl , but neither was she a paid companion .
Madame Stahl called her by the diminutive ' Varenka , ' and others called her Mademoiselle Varenka .
This Mlle Varenka was not exactly past her early youth , but seemed to be a person destitute of youthfulness : she might be nineteen years old or she might be thirty .
If one examined her features , she was good @-@ looking rather than plain , despite her unhealthy complexion .
Her figure would have been good had she not been too lean and her head too large for her medium height ; but she was not likely to prove attractive to men .
She was like a beautiful flower which though not yet in full bloom is already beginning to fade and has no scent .
Another reason why she could not be attractive to men was because she lacked that of which Kitty had too much - a restrained flame of vitality and consciousness of her own attractiveness .
She seemed always occupied with something there could be no doubt about , and therefore it seemed that no side issue could interest her .
By this contrast to herself Kitty was specially attracted .
The more Kitty observed her unknown friend , the more she was convinced that this girl really was the perfect being she imagined her to be , and the more she wished to make her acquaintance .
The two girls came across one another several times a day , and every time they met Kitty 's eyes said : ' Who are you ?
What are you ? Surely you are the delightful creature I imagine you to be ?
But for heaven 's sake ' - her look added - ' do not think that I shall force myself on you .
I simply admire and love you . ' ' I too love you , and you are very , very sweet .
I should love you still more if I had the time , ' the stranger 's look replied .
Soon after the Shcherbatskys ' arrival , two new persons who provoked everybody 's disapproval began to appear of a morning at the Wells .
Having recognized them to be Russians , Kitty at once began to make up a beautiful and touching romance about them .
But the Princess , having found out from the visitors ' list that they were Nicholas Levin and Mary Ivanovna , explained to Kitty what a bad man this Levin was , and all her dreams about those two people vanished .
Not so much because of what her mother had told her , as because the man was Constantine 's brother , these two people appeared very disagreeable to Kitty .
This Levin , by his habit of jerking his head , now inspired an irrepressible feeling of aversion in her .
It seemed to her that his large , dreadful eyes , which followed her insistently , expressed hatred and irony , and she tried to avoid encountering him .
IT WAS A DULL DAY , it rained the whole morning , and the patients with their umbrellas crowded the covered gallery .
Kitty was walking with her mother and the Moscow Colonel , who swaggered gaily in his short , German coat , bought ready @-@ made in Frankfort .
They kept to one side of the gallery , trying to avoid Levin , who was walking on the other side .
Varenka , in her dark dress and a black hat with turned @-@ down rim , was pacing the whole length of the gallery with a blind Frenchwoman , and each time she met Kitty they exchanged a friendly look .
'Mama , may I speak to her ? ' asked Kitty , following her unknown friend with her eyes and noticing that she was moving toward the Well and that they could meet her there .
'Well , if you want to so much , I will inquire about her first and will speak to her myself , ' answered her mother . ' What do you see particular in her ?
I expect she 's a companion .
If you like I will make Madame Stahl 's acquaintance .
Kitty knew that her mother was offended that Madame Stahl seemed to avoid making her acquaintance .
'She is wonderfully sweet ! ' she said , looking at Varenka. who was handing a tumbler to the Frenchwoman . ' See how naturally and sweetly she does it . ' 
They were just turning to go back , when they suddenly heard voices not merely loud , but shouting .
Levin had stopped and was shouting , and the doctor was also excited .
A crowd collected about them .
The Princess and Kitty withdrew hurriedly , but the Colonel joined the crowd to find out what the noise was all about .
'What was the matter ? ' asked the Princess .
'It 's shameful and scandalous , ' replied the Colonel . ' The one thing to fear is meeting Russians abroad .
That tall gentleman has been quarrelling with the doctor and insulting him , because he is dissatisfied with the doctor 's treatment . He shook his stick at him !
'Ah , how unpleasant ! ' said the Princess . ' But how did it all end ? '
'Luckily that ... you know the girl with a hat like a mushroom - she 's Russian , I think - intervened , ' said the Colonel .
'Mlle Varenka ? ' asked Kitty in a pleased tone .
'There , Mama , ' said Kitty . ' And you are surprised that I admire her . ' 
She went up to them , talked to them , and acted as interpreter for the woman , who spoke nothing but Russian .
Choosing a moment when her daughter had gone to the Well and Varenka had stopped in front of a baker 's shop , the Princess went up to her .
'It is more than mutual , Princess , ' replied Varenka hurriedly .
'What a good action you performed yesterday for our unfortunate fellow @-@ countryman ! ' said the Princess .
Varenka blushed .
'I don 't remember ; I don 't think I did anything , ' said she .
'Oh , yes , you saved that Levin from unpleasantness . ' 
'Well , you see , his companion called me , and I tried to soothe him ; he is very ill and was dissatisfied with his doctor .
I am used to looking after invalids of that kind . ' 
'Oh , yes , I have heard that you live in Mentone with your aunt , I think , Madame Stahl .
I call her Mama , but I am not related to her . She adopted me , ' answered Varenka , and blushed again .
This was said so simply , and the frank and open expression of her face was so amiable , that the Princess understood what made Kitty so fond of this Varenka .
'Well , and what about that Levin ? '
'He is leaving , ' answered Varenka .
Just then Kitty , beaming with joy that her mother had made acquaintance with her unknown friend , returned from the Well .
'There , Kitty , your great wish to make acquaintance with Mlle ... '
'Varenka , ' prompted Varenka with a smile , ' everybody calls me so . ' 
But though her hand did not return the pressure , Mlle Varenka 's face shone with a soft and pleased , though rather sad , smile , which disclosed her large but splendid teeth .
'Varenka , Mama wants you ! ' they shouted .
THE PARTICULARS THE PRINCESS SHCHERBATSKAYA LEARNT about Varenka 's past and about her relations with Madame Stahl , and about Madame Stahl herself , were the following :
Madame Stahl , of whom some people said that she had tormented her husband to death , while others said that , by his immoral conduct , he had tormented her , had always been a sickly and ecstatic woman .
That child was Varenka .
Madame Stahl learnt afterwards that Varenka was not her daughter , but continued to bring her up , the more readily because it happened that very soon Varenka had no relations left .
Madame Stahl had lived continuously abroad in the South for more than ten years , hardly ever leaving her bed .
No one knew what her religion was : Roman Catholic , Protestant , or Greek Orthodox , but one thing was certain , namely , that she was in friendly relations with the most highly @-@ placed personages of all the churches and denominations .
Varenka always lived with her abroad , and all who knew Madame Stahl knew and liked Mlle Varenka , as everybody called her .
When she had made Varenka 's acquaintance Kitty became more and more fascinated by her friend and found new virtues in her every day .
The Princess , having heard that Varenka sang very well , invited her to come and sing to them one evening .
Varenka , however , came in the evening and brought her music .
Varenka did not seem at all abashed by the fact that strangers were present , and she went straight up to the piano .
She could not accompany herself but she sang at sight admirably .
Kitty , who played well , accompanied her .
'You have an exceptional talent , ' said the Princess , after Varenka had sung her first song excellently .
Mary Evgenyevna and her daughter thanked her and praised her singing .
'See , ' said the Colonel , looking out of the window , ' what an audience has assembled to hear you . ' Underneath the window a considerable crowd really had collected .
'I am very glad it gives you pleasure , ' said Varenka simply .
Kitty looked at her friend with pride .
'If it were I , ' thought Kitty , ' how proud I should feel !
But she is quite indifferent .
She only wished not to refuse , and to give Mama pleasure .
What is it in her ?
What gives her this power to disregard everything and to be so quietly independent ?
How I should like to know this , and to learn it from her ! ' thought Kitty , gazing into the calm face .
The Princess asked Varenka to sing again , and she sang another song just as truly , clearly , and well , standing straight at the piano , and beating time on it with her thin brown hand .
The next piece in the music book was an Italian song .
Kitty played the prelude and looked round at Varenka .
'Let us skip this one , ' said Varenka , blushing .
Kitty anxiously and inquiringly fixed her eyes on Varenka 's face .
'Well then , another one , ' she said , hurriedly turning over the pages , immediately realizing that there was something particular connected with that song .
'No , ' answered Varenka , putting her hand on the music and smiling . ' No , let us sing that one . ' And she sang the piece just as calmly , coldly , and well as the previous ones .
When she had finished everybody again thanked her and went to drink tea .
But Kitty and Varenka went out into the little garden belonging to the house .
'Am I not right , you have some memory attached to that song ? ' asked Kitty . ' Don 't tell me about it , ' she added hurriedly , ' only say if I am right ! '
I will tell you , ' said Varenka simply and without waiting for a reply continued : ' Yes , there is a memory attached to it and it was painful once .
I loved a man and used to sing that song to him . ' 
Kitty , deeply moved , gazed silently with wide @-@ open eyes at Varenka .
'I loved him and he loved me ; but his mother would not have it , and he married another .
He lives not far from us now , and I see him sometimes .
You did not think that I too have had a romance ? ' she said , and on her handsome face there flickered for an instant a spark of the fire which , Kitty felt , had once lighted up her whole being .
Why , if I were a man I could not have loved anyone else after knowing you .
But I can 't understand how , to satisfy his mother , he could forget you and make you unhappy . He must be quite heartless . ' 
'Oh no . He is a very good man , and I am not unhappy ; on the contrary , I am very happy .
Well , we shan 't sing any more to @-@ day ? ' she added , and went toward the house .
'How good you are , how good ! ' exclaimed Kitty , stopping her and kissing her . ' If only I could be a little bit like you ! '
'Why should you be like anyone ?
You 're very good as you are , ' said Varenka , smiling her gentle , weary smile .
'No , I am not at all good .
Wait a bit , let us sit down again , ' said Kitty , making Varenka sit down on a garden seat beside her . ' Tell me , is it possible that you are not offended at the thought that a man despised your love ?
'But he did not despise it ; I believe that he loved me , but he was an obedient son ... '
'Then he would have behaved badly and I should not regret him , ' replied Varenka , evidently conscious that they were now speaking not about her but about Kitty .
'But the humiliation ? ' said Kitty . ' One cannot forget the humiliation , one cannot , ' and she remembered the look she gave Vronsky at the ball , when the music stopped .
'Where is the humiliation ?
You did not do anything wrong ? '
'Worse than wrong , shameful . ' 
'Shameful in what respect ? ' she said . ' You could not have told a man who was himself indifferent to you that you loved him ? '
No , no ; there are such things as looks and ways of behaving .
The question is , do you love him now or not ? ' said Varenka , calling everything by its plain name .
'The shame , the humiliation ... '
'Dear me , if every one were as sensitive as you are ! ' said Varenka . ' There is no girl who has not gone through the same sort of thing .
And it is all so unimportant . ' 
'Then what is important ? ' asked Kitty , looking into her face with surprised curiosity .
'Ah , many things are important , ' replied Varenka , not knowing what to say .
Either take a shawl or come in . ' 
Kitty held her hands , and with passionate curiosity and entreaty questioned Varenka with her eyes : ' What - what is most important ? What gives you such peace ?
But Varenka did not even understand what Kitty 's eyes were asking .
She only knew that she had to call on Madame Berthe and get home in time for Mama 's midnight tea .
She went in , collected her music , and having said good @-@ night to everybody , prepared to go .
Kitty noticed that Varenka had difficulty in suppressing a smile at the idea that she needed anyone to see her home .
'Oh no , I always go out alone and nothing ever happens to me , ' she said , taking up her hat .
KITTY ALSO BECAME ACQUAINTED with Madame Stahl , and this acquaintanceship , together with Varenka 's friendship not only had a great influence on Kitty , but comforted her in her sorrow .
It was revealed to her that besides that instinctive life she had lived hitherto there was also a spiritual life .
But however lofty may have been Madame Stahl 's character , however touching her story , and however elevated and tender her words , Kitty could not help noticing some perplexing traits in her .
She noticed that Madame Stahl , when inquiring about Kitty 's relatives , smiled contemptuously , which did not accord with Christian kindness .
And once , when Kitty met a Roman Catholic priest at the house , she observed that Madame Stahl carefully hid her face behind the lampshade and smiled in a peculiar manner .
Trifling as these things were , they disturbed Kitty , and she felt doubts about Madame Stahl .
But Varenka , lonely , without relatives or friends , with her sad disillusionment , wishing for nothing and regretting nothing , personified that perfection of which Kitty only allowed herself to dream .
In Varenka she saw that it was only necessary to forget oneself and to love others in order to be at peace , happy , and lovely .
And such a person Kitty wished to be .
Having now clearly understood what was most important , Kitty was not content merely to delight in it , but immediately with her whole soul devoted herself to this newly revealed life .
She formed a plan for her future life , based on what Varenka told her about the work of Madame Stahl and of others whom she named .
The idea of reading the Gospels to criminals , as Aline did , charmed Kitty particularly .
But all these were secret dreams , which she did not speak of either to her mother or to Varenka .
At first the Princess only noticed that Kitty was strongly influenced by her engoument , [ Infatuation . ] as she called it , for Madame Stahl and especially for Varenka .
She noticed that Kitty not only imitated Varenka 's activities , but involuntarily copied her manner of walking , speaking , and blinking her eyes .
But afterwards the Princess also noticed that , apart from this infatuation , a serious spiritual change was taking place in her daughter .
Kitty evidently prided herself on fulfilling the duties of a sister @-@ of @-@ mercy in that family .
This was all very well , and the Princess had nothing against it , especially as Petrov 's wife was quite a well @-@ bred woman , and the German Princess , having noticed Kitty 's activities , praised her , calling her a ministering angel .
It would have been quite right had it not been overdone .
But the Princess saw that her daughter was getting out of bounds and spoke to her about it .
But her daughter did not reply ; she only felt in her soul that one could not speak of overdoing Christianity .
How was it possible to exaggerate , when following the teaching which bids us turn the other cheek when we are struck , and give our coat when our cloak is taken ?
But the Princess disliked this excess , and disliked it all the more because she felt that Kitty did not wish to open her whole heart to her .
And Kitty really did hide her new views and feelings from her mother .
She kept them secret not from want of respect and love , but just because her mother was her mother .
She would have revealed them to anyone sooner than to her .
'I invited her and she did not seem pleased . ' 
'I did not notice anything , Mama , ' said Kitty , flushing up .
'Is it long since you went to see them ? '
'Well , go if you like , ' said the Princess , looking intently into her daughter 's confused face and trying to guess the cause of her confusion .
That same day Varenka came to dinner , and said that Anna Pavlovna had changed her mind about going to the mountains tomorrow .
'Kitty , have you not had some unpleasantness with the Petrovs ? ' the Princess asked when they were again alone together . ' Why has she stopped sending the children here and coming herself ? '
Kitty replied that nothing had passed between them and that she did not at all understand why Anna Pavlovna seemed dissatisfied with her .
Kitty spoke the truth : she did not know why Anna Pavlovna had changed toward her , but she guessed it .
She guessed it to be something that she could not tell her mother and did not even say to herself .
It was one of those things which one knows and yet cannot say even to oneself - so dreadful and shameful would it be to make a mistake .
Again and again she went over in memory all the relations she had had with that family .
How good it had all been !
She remembered her first efforts to conquer the repulsion she felt for him , as for all consumptives , and her efforts to find something to say to him .
She remembered the timid look , full of emotion , with which he gazed at her , and the strange feeling of compassion and awkwardness followed by a consciousness of her own benevolence , that she had experienced .
How good it had all been !
But all that had been at first .
Now for some days past all had suddenly been spoilt .
Anna Pavlovna now met Kitty with affected amiability and constantly watched her husband and her .
Could his touching pleasure when she drew near be the cause of Anna Pavlovna 's coldness ?
'Yes , and perhaps my giving him his plaid may also have been unpleasant to her .
It was such a simple thing , but he took it so awkwardly , and thanked me so much that I myself felt awkward .
And then that portrait of me , which he did so well !
And above all - that look , confused and tender ...
Yes , yes , it is so ! ' Kitty said to herself quite horrified ; and then , ' No , it is impossible , it must not be !
This doubt poisoned her delight in her new life .
QUITE TOWARD THE END OF THE SEASON Prince Shcherbatsky , who from Carlsbad had gone on to Baden and Kissingen to see some Russian friends and to ' inhale some Russian spirit , ' as he expressed it , returned to his family .
The views of the Prince and Princess on life abroad were diametrically opposed .
He returned looking thinner , with the skin on his cheeks hanging loose , but in the brightest of spirits .
His spirits were still better when he saw Kitty completely recovered .
But these unpleasant rumours were soon drowned in that sea of kind @-@ hearted cheerfulness which was always within him and which was increased by the Carlsbad water .
The day after his arrival the Prince , attired in a long overcoat , and with his Russian wrinkles , and his slightly puffy cheeks supported by a stiff collar , went out in the brightest of spirits to the Springs with his daughter .
Kitty was no longer struck by this contrast .
'Introduce me , introduce me to your new friends , ' he said to his daughter , pressing her arm with his elbow . ' I have even taken a liking to your nasty Soden because it has done you so much good .
Kitty told him the names of the acquaintances and others whom they met .
Just at the entrance to the gardens they met the blind Madame Berthe with her guide , and the Prince was pleased by the tender look on the old Frenchwoman 's face when she heard Kitty 's voice .
'Oh , Mlle Varenka is a real angel , allez , ' said Madame Berthe .
In the gallery they met Varenka herself .
She was walking hurriedly toward them with an elegant little red bag in her hand .
'Of course I know you , I 've heard all about you , ' the Prince said to her with a smile , by which Kitty saw with joy that her father liked Varenka . ' Where are you hurrying so to ? '
'Mama is here , ' said she , turning to Kitty . ' She did not sleep all night and the doctor advised her to go out .
'I knew her husband and her too , slightly , before she joined the Pietists . ' 
'What are Pietists , Papa ? ' asked Kitty , frightened by the fact that what she valued so highly in Madame Stahl had a name .
'I don 't know very well myself .
I only know that she thanks God for everything , including all misfortunes , ... and thanks God for her husband 's death .
And it seems funny , for they did not get on well together ...
Who is that ? What a pitiful face , ' he said , noticing an invalid of medium height who sat on a bench in a brown coat and white trousers which fell into strange folds over his emaciated legs .
The man raised his straw hat above his thin curly hair , uncovering a tall forehead with an unhealthy redness where the hat had pressed it .
'Poor man , what a nice face he has ! ' said the Prince . ' Why did you not go up to him ?
'Well , come back then , ' said Kitty , turning resolutely . ' How are you to @-@ day ? ' she asked Petrov .
Petrov rose with the aid of a stick and looked timidly at the Prince .
'This is my daughter , ' said the Prince , ' allow me to introduce myself . ' 
The artist bowed and smiled , exposing his strangely glistening white teeth .
'We were expecting you yesterday , Princess , ' he said to Kitty .
He staggered as he said it , and to make it appear as if he had done this intentionally , he repeated the movement .
'I meant to come , but Varenka told me that Anna Pavlovna sent word that you were not going . ' 
'Not going ? ' said Petrov , flushing and immediately beginning to cough and looking round for his wife . ' Annetta , Annetta ! ' he said loudly , and the veins in his white neck protruded like thick cords .
'How is it you sent word to the Princess that we were not going ? ' he said in an irritable whisper , his voice failing him .
I thought we were not going , ' said his wife with vexation .
'How so ? When ... ' he was interrupted by a fit of coughing , and made a hopeless gesture with his hand .
'Yes , Papa , ' replied Kitty . ' And you know they have three children , no servants , and hardly any means .
He receives something from the Academy , ' she explained animatedly , trying to stifle the excitement resulting from the strange alteration in Anna Pavlovna 's manner toward her .
'And there 's Madame Stahl , ' said Kitty , pointing to a bath @-@ chair on which , under a sunshade , lay something supported by pillows , wrapped up in grey and pale @-@ blue .
Behind her was a sullen @-@ looking , robust German workman who pushed her bath @-@ chair .
At her side stood a fair @-@ haired Swedish Count , whom Kitty knew by name .
Several patients lingered near by , gazing at this lady as at something out of the common .
The Prince approached her , and Kitty immediately noticed in his eyes that ironical spark which so disturbed her .
He went up to Madame Stahl , and spoke to her extremely politely and nicely in that excellent French which so very few people speak nowadays .
'I do not know whether you will remember me , but I must recall myself to you in order to thank you for your kindness to my daughter , ' he said , raising his hat and not putting it on again .
'Prince Alexander Shcherbatsky , ' said Madame Stahl , lifting toward him her heavenly eyes , in which Kitty detected displeasure . ' I am very pleased .
'No , but I am accustomed to it , ' said Madame Stahl and introduced the Swedish Count to the Prince .
'You are very little changed , ' said the Prince . ' I have not had the honour of seeing you for ten or eleven years . ' 
It often seems strange to think why this life should drag on ...
On that side ! ' she said irritably to Varenka , who was not wrapping the plaid round her feet the right way .
'To do good , probably , ' said the Prince , whose eyes were laughing .
'Ah ! ' exclaimed the Prince , seeing the Moscow Colonel standing near by , and with a bow to Madame Stahl he moved away with his daughter and with the Moscow Colonel , who had joined them .
'That is our aristocracy , Prince ! ' remarked the Colonel , wishing to appear sarcastic . He had a pique against Madame Stahl because she did not wish to be acquainted with him .
'Always the same , ' answered the Prince .
'Did you know her before her illness , Prince ? I mean before she was laid up ? '
'Yes , I knew her when she first became an invalid . ' 
'I hear she has not been up for ten years . ' 
'Evil tongues say so , my love . But your Varenka does get it , ' he added .
'Perhaps , ' he said , pressing her arm with his elbow . ' But it is better to do good so that , ask whom you will , no one knows anything about it . ' 
Kitty was silent , not because she had nothing to say but because she did not want to reveal her secret thoughts even to her father .
There remained only a short @-@ legged woman who was always lying down because she had a bad figure , and who tormented poor unresisting Varenka for not tucking her plaid the right way .
And by no efforts of imagination could the former Madame Stahl be recalled .
THE PRINCE IMPARTED HIS GOOD SPIRITS to his household , his friends , and even to his German landlord .
The landlord and the servants brightened up under his influence .
They knew his generosity , and in a quarter of an hour the sick Hamburg doctor , who lived upstairs , was looking with envy from his window at the merry party of healthy Russians gathered under the chestnut tree .
At the other end sat the Prince , making a substantial meal and talking loudly and merrily .
The Princess laughed at her husband for his Russian ways , but was livelier and brighter than she had ever been during her stay at the watering @-@ place .
The Colonel smiled , as he always did at the Prince 's jokes ; but with regard to Europe ( which he thought he had carefully studied ) he sided with the Princess .
All this cheered Kitty up , but she could not help being troubled .
She could not solve the problem unconsciously set her by her father 's jocular view of her friends and of the life she had begun to love so much .
To this problem was added the change in her relations with the Petrovs , which had been so clearly and unpleasantly demonstrated that morning .
Everybody was merry , but Kitty could not be merry , and this troubled her still more .
She felt almost as she used to feel when , as a child , she was locked up in a room for punishment and heard her sister 's merry laughter .
'Now , why have you bought that mass of things ? ' asked the Princess , smiling and passing her husband a cup of coffee .
'One goes out walking , comes to a shop , and they ask one to buy something . It 's " Erlaucht , Excellenz , Durchlaucht . "
'That 's all because you are bored , ' said the Princess .
'Bored , of course I am !
'How can you be bored , Prince ?
There is so much that is interesting in Germany now , ' said Mary Evgenyevna .
But I know all your interesting things : plum @-@ soup and pea @-@ sausages . I know them .
'No , say what you please , Prince , their institutions are interesting , ' said the Colonel .
They are as self @-@ satisfied as brass farthings ; they 've conquered everybody .
Now tell me what am I to be pleased about ?
I have not conquered anybody , but here I have to take off my own boots and even put them outside the door myself .
'But " time is money , " don 't forget that , ' said the Colonel .
There are times when one would give a whole month for a shilling and there are times when you would not give half an hour at any price .
Is not that so , Kitty ?
Why are you so glum ? '
'Where are you off to ?
Stay a little longer , ' he said , turning to Varenka .
She was not worse , but different from what Kitty previously had imagined her to be .
'Oh dear , I have not laughed so much for a long time ! ' said Varenka , collecting her sunshade and bag . ' What a dear your Papa is ! '
'When shall we meet ? ' asked Varenka .
'Mama was going to call on the Petrovs .
Will you be there ? ' asked Kitty , trying to sound Varenka .
'I will , ' answered Varenka . ' They are preparing to leave , so I have promised to help them pack . ' 
'Then I 'll come too . ' 
'Why not , why not , why not ? ' asked Kitty with wide @-@ open eyes , and holding Varenka 's sunshade to prevent her going . ' No , wait a bit , and tell me why not . ' 
'No , no , tell me why you do not wish me to be often at the Petrovs ?
Why ? '
'I have not said so , ' replied Varenka quietly .
'No , please tell me ! '
'Shall I tell you everything ? ' said Varenka .
'There is nothing special to tell , only Petrov used to want to leave sooner but now does not want to go , ' said Varenka smiling .
And you know how excitable such invalids are . ' 
Kitty frowned yet more , and remained silent , and only Varenka spoke , trying to soften and soothe Kitty , and foreseeing an approaching explosion of tears or words , she knew not which .
'So it is better for you not to go ...
And , you understand , don 't be hurt ... '
'It serves me right , it serves me right ! ' Kitty began hurriedly , snatching Varenka 's sunshade out of her hands , and looking past her friend 's eyes .
Varenka felt like smiling at her friend 's childish anger but feared to offend her .
'It serves me right because it was all pretence , all invented and not heartfelt .
What business had I with a stranger ?
So it comes about that I am the cause of a quarrel , and have been doing what nobody asked me to do .
'But what motive had you for pretending ? ' said Varenka softly .
'Oh , how stupid , how stupid !
There was no need at all ...
It was all pretence ! ' Kitty said , opening and shutting the sunshade .
'But with what object ? '
'To appear better than others to myself and to God - to deceive everybody .
No , I shall not give in to that again !
Let me be bad , but at any rate not false , not a humbug ! '
'But who is a " humbug " ? ' asked Varenka reproachfully . ' You speak as if ... '
But Kitty was in one of her fits of passion .
She would not let Varenka finish .
'I am not talking about you , not about you at all .
Yes , yes , you are all perfection but how can I help it if I am bad ?
It would not have happened if I were not bad .
So let me be what I am , but not pretend .
What is Anna Pavlovna to me ?
Let them live as they like , and I will live as I like .
I cannot be different ...
'But what is not the thing ? ' said Varenka , quite perplexed .
I can 't live except by my own heart , but you live by principles .
I have loved you quite simply , but you , I expect , only in order to save me , to teach me . ' 
'You are unjust , ' said Varenka .
'But I am not talking about others , only about myself . ' 
'Kitty ! ' came her mother 's voice , ' come here and show Papa your corals . ' 
'What 's the matter ?
Why are you so red ? ' asked both her mother and father together .
Why have I offended her ?
Varenka , with her hat on , sat at the table examining the spring of her sunshade , which Kitty had broken .
'Varenka , forgive me , forgive me ! ' whispered Kitty , coming close to her . ' I don 't remember what I said . ' 
'Really , I did not wish to distress you , ' said Varenka with a smile .
Peace was made .
But with her father 's return the world in which she had been living completely changed for Kitty .
But her affection for Varenka was not weakened .
'I will come when you are married , ' said Varenka .
'I shall never marry . ' 
Kitty returned to Russia quite cured !
She was not as careless and light @-@ hearted as before , but she was at peace . Her old Moscow sorrows were no more than a memory .
SERGIUS IVANICH KOZNYSHEV , wishing to take a rest from mental work , went to stay with his brother in the country instead of going abroad as usual .
According to his views country life was preferable to any other , and he had now come to his brother 's house to enjoy it .
Constantine Levin was very pleased , especially as he no longer expected his brother Nicholas to come that summer .
But in spite of his affection and respect for Koznyshev , Constantine did not feel at ease with his step @-@ brother in the country .
To Constantine the country seemed a good place because it was the scene of unquestionably useful labour ; to Koznyshev it seemed good because one could and should do nothing there .
Besides this , Koznyshev 's attitude toward the peasants jarred on Constantine .
Had Constantine been asked whether he liked the peasants , he would not have known what to answer .
He both liked and disliked them , just as he liked and disliked all human beings .
To say that he knew the peasants was tantamount to saying that he knew human beings .
His methodical mind had formed definite views on the life of the people , founded partly on that life itself , but chiefly on its contrast .
He never altered his opinions about the people nor his sympathetic attitude toward them .
With an elder brother 's condescension he sometimes explained to him the meaning of things , but could find no pleasure in discussion , because he could gain too easy a victory .
Constantine considered his brother to be a man of great intellect , noble in the highest sense of the word , and gifted with the power of working for the general welfare .
His most usual and natural listener was his brother ; and therefore , despite their friendly relations , Constantine felt uncomfortable at leaving him alone .
Koznyshev loved to lie basking in the sunshine , talking lazily .
'You can 't imagine what a pleasure this complete laziness is to me : not a thought in my brain - you might send a ball rolling through it ! '
'Haven 't you walked about enough in this heat ? ' said Koznyshev .
'No ; I must just look in at the counting @-@ house for a moment , ' answered Levin , and off he ran to the fields .
AT THE BEGINNING OF JUNE Levin 's old nurse and housekeeper , Agatha Mikhaylovna , happened to slip as she was carrying to the cellar a jar of mushrooms which she had just pickled , and sprained her wrist .
After the doctor 's departure Koznyshev felt inclined to go to the river with his fishing rod .
He was fond of angling , and seemed proud of being able to like such a stupid occupation .
Constantine , who was obliged to go to the cornfields and meadows , offered to give his brother a lift in his trap .
It was the time of that short pause before the labour , yearly renewed , of getting in the harvest , which always demands all the peasants ' strength for its accomplishment .
The promise of the harvest was splendid , the weather clear and hot , and the short night dewy .
The brothers had to pass through the forest on their way to the meadows .
Constantine Levin did not like talking or hearing about the beauty of nature .
Words seemed to detract from the beauty of what he was looking at .
He assented to what his brother said but could not help thinking of other things .
When they emerged from the forest his attention was arrested at the sight of a fallow field and a hillock , here and there yellow with grass or broken up and cut into squares , in some parts speckled with heaps of manure , or even ploughed .
Levin counted the carts , and was pleased to see that sufficient manure was being brought . At sight of the meadows his thoughts turned to the hay harvest .
The thought of the hay harvest always touched him to the quick .
When they reached the meadow Levin stopped .
Though Constantine was loth to crush his grass , he drove across the meadow .
The tall grass twined softly about the wheels and the horse 's legs , leaving seeds on the wet spokes and hubs .
'Have you found it , Fomich ? ' he asked .
'Found it , indeed , Constantine Dmitrich !
Day , but you always mow earlier .
Why not , God willing ?
'And what do you think of the weather '
Though he had caught nothing , Koznyshev did not feel bored and seemed in the best of spirits .
Levin saw that he had been roused by his conversation with the doctor and wanted to have a talk .
Levin , on the contrary , was impatient to get home in order to give orders about hiring the mowers on the morrow , and to decide about the hay harvest , which greatly occupied his mind .
'Well , let 's go , ' said he .
'Where 's the hurry ?
How wet you are !
Though nothing bites , it 's pleasant ; hunting and similar sports are good because they bring one in touch with nature ...
'I don 't know that riddle , ' replied Levin in a dull tone .
If all the better sort stand aside , of course heaven only knows what will happen .
We expend money for salaries , but there are no schools , no medical assistance , no midwives , no chemists , no anything ! '
'You know I have tried , ' Levin replied slowly and reluctantly , ' but I can 't ! So what am I to do ? '
'Why can 't you ?
I confess I don 't understand .
'Neither the one nor the other - nor the last .
I have tried and seen that I can do nothing , ' said Levin .
He did not pay much attention to what his brother was saying .
Peering into the distance across the river , he made out something black in the cornfield , and could not see whether it was only a horse or the steward on horseback .
'Why can you do nothing ?
You have made an attempt , and because according to your judgment it was a failure , you gave it up .
Fancy having so little ambition ! '
'Ambition ? ' reiterated Levin , stung by his brother 's words . ' I do not understand it .
'Come now ! After all , ' continued the elder brother with a frown on his handsome , intelligent face , ' there are limits to everything !
It is all very well to be a crank , to be sincere and dislike hypocrisy - I know that very well - but what you are saying has either no meaning at all or a very bad meaning .
How can you consider it unimportant that the people , whom you love , as you maintain ... '
'I never maintained it , ' thought Levin ...
' ... are dying without help ?
Constantine felt that there was nothing for him but to submit or else to own to a lack of love for the common cause , and he felt wounded and grieved .
'Both the one and the other , ' said he resolutely . ' I can 't see how it is to be done ... '
'Well , it seems impossible to me ...
Besides , I have no faith in medicine generally ... '
'Come now ! That is unjust ...
I could cite thousands of cases to you ...
'Schools ? What for ? '
'What do you mean ?
Is it possible to doubt the utility of education ?
If it is good for you , why not for everybody ? '
Constantine felt himself morally cornered , and in consequence became excited and involuntarily betrayed the chief cause of his indifference to social questions .
This unexpected view of the question took Koznyshev by surprise ; but he immediately formed a new plan of attack .
He remained silent awhile , lifted his rod and threw the line again , and then turned to his brother with a smile .
There is need of a medical centre after all .
Did we not send for the district doctor for Agatha Mikhaylovna ? '
'But I think her hand will remain crooked all the same . ' 
Ask anyone you like , ' said Constantine , decidedly . ' A peasant who can read and write is far worse as a labourer .
They can 't mend the roads , and when they build a bridge they steal . ' 
Do you admit that education is a good thing for the people ? '
He felt that , since he admitted this much , it would be proved to him that he was talking meaningless twaddle .
How it would be proved to him he did not know ; but he knew that it certainly would be proved logically , and waited for that proof .
The proof turned out to be far simpler than Constantine anticipated .
'If you admit it to be good , ' said Koznyshev , ' then , as an honest man , you cannot help loving and sympathizing with such movements and wishing to work for them . ' 
'But I am not yet prepared to say that such work is desirable , ' returned Levin .
'I mean I consider it neither desirable nor possible . ' 
'You can 't tell without having tried it . ' 
'Well , let 's grant it is so , ' said Levin , though he did not grant it at all . ' Still , I don 't see why I should he bothered with it . ' 
'What do you mean ? '
'I don 't see what philosophy has to do with it , ' replied Koznyshev in a tone that made it seem - at least Levin thought so - that he did not consider his brother had a right to argue on philosophical questions .
This irritated Levin .
'This is what it has to do with it , ' he said , getting heated . ' I believe that in any case the motive power of all our actions is our personal happiness .
At present I , a nobleman , see nothing in our Zemstvo that could conduce to my welfare .
The roads are not better and cannot be made better , and my horses do manage to pull me over the bad ones .
I don 't require doctors and medical centres ; I don 't need the magistrate ; I never apply to him and never will .
I not only do not require schools , but they would even do me harm , as I have already told you .
'Come , ' smilingly interrupted Koznyshev , ' it was not our personal interest which induced us to work for the emancipation of the serfs , and yet we did it . ' 
'No , no ! ' Constantine interrupted , growing more and more heated .
But Koznyshev shrugged his shoulders .
'Well , what do you want to prove by that ? '
'And to @-@ morrow you may be going to law . Would you rather be tried in the old Criminal Court ? '
That is the common and philosophical truth , ' said he , emphasizing the word philosophical , as if he wanted to show that he might talk about philosophy as much as anyone else .
'He too has some philosophy or other to serve his inclinations , ' he thought
But that is not the point . I need only correct your illustration to get at the point .
The birches are not stuck in : some of them are planted , and others are sown and have to be tended carefully .
Only those peoples have a future , only those peoples can be called historic , that have a sense of what is important and great in their institutions , and value them . ' 
And to prove the inaccuracy of Levin 's views , Koznyshev carried the conversation into the realm of philosophy and history , which was beyond Constantine 's reach .
But he did not go deeply into these questions , and without replying to his brother began reflecting on a totally different and personal matter .
Koznyshev wound up his last line , untied the horse , and they started on their homeward way .
Since his brother 's arrival , however , he was in doubt whether to go mowing or not .
He did not feel comfortable at the thought of leaving his brother alone all day long , and he also feared that Koznyshev might laugh at him .
But while walking over the meadow he recalled the impression mowing had made on him , and almost made up his mind to do it .
After his irritating conversation with his brother he again remembered his intention .
'I need physical exercise ; without it my character gets quite spoilt , ' thought he , and determined to go and mow , however uncomfortable his brother and the peasants might make him feel .
In the evening Constantine went to the office and gave orders about the work , sending round to the villages to tell the mowers to come next day to the Kalina meadow , the largest and finest he had .
'And please send my scythe to Titus to be sharpened , and have it taken to the meadow to @-@ morrow : I may go mowing myself , ' he said , trying to overcome his confusion .
The steward smiled and said ,
'The weather looks settled ; to @-@ morrow we begin mowing . ' 
'I like that work very much , ' said Koznyshev .
Koznyshev looked up at his brother in surprise . ' How do you mean ?
All day , just like the peasants ? '
'Yes , it is very pleasant , ' replied Levin .
'It is splendid physical exercise , but you will hardly be able to hold out , ' remarked Koznyshev , without the least sarcasm .
'I have tried it .
I don 't think I shall lag behind ... '
But tell me , how do the peasants take it ?
I expect they laugh at their crank of a master ? '
'But how can you dine with them ?
'No ; I will just come home at their dinner @-@ time . ' 
Next morning Constantine got up earlier than usual , but giving instructions about the farming delayed him and when he came to the meadow each man was already mowing his second swath .
He counted forty @-@ two of them .
They moved slowly along the uneven bottom of the meadow , where a weir had once been .
Levin dismounted and , tethering his horse by the roadside , went up to Titus , who fetched another scythe from behind a bush and gave it to Levin .
'It 's ready , master ! Like a razor , it will mow of itself , ' said Titus , taking off his cap and smiling as he handed the scythe .
The peasants , perspiring and merry , who had finished their swaths came out on to the road one after another , and laughingly exchanged greetings with the master .
'Mind , master ! Having put your hand to the plough , don 't look back ! ' And Levin heard the sound of repressed laughter among the mowers .
'I will try not to lag behind , ' he said , taking his place behind Titus and waiting his turn to fall in .
'Mind ! ' repeated the old man .
He heard voices behind him :
'You are taking too wide a swath , you 'll get knocked up . ' ...
'He 's the master , he must work ; he 's working for himself ' ...
'But look how uneven ! ' ...
They came to softer grass , and Levin , who was listening without replying , followed Titus and tried to mow as well as possible .
When they had gone some hundred steps Titus was still going on without pausing , showing no signs of fatigue , while Levin was already beginning to fear he would not be able to keep up , he felt so tired .
But just at that moment Titus stopped of his own accord , stooped , took up some grass and wiped his scythe with it .
The peasant behind him was still mowing but was obviously tired too , for he stopped without coming even with Levin and began whetting his scythe .
Titus whetted his own and Levin 's , and they began mowing again .
The same thing happened at Levin 's second attempt .
Titus swung his scythe , swing after swing , without stopping and without getting tired .
In this way they finished the swath .
What gave him most pleasure was the knowledge that he would be able to keep up with the peasants .
The only thing marring his joy was the fact that his swath was not well mown .
The next swaths were easier , but still Levin had to work with all his might to keep even with the peasants .
He thought of nothing and desired nothing , except not to lag behind and to do his work as well as possible .
Suddenly he was conscious of a pleasant coolness on his hot perspiring shoulders , without knowing what it was or whence it came .
A dark cloud was hanging low overhead , and large drops of rain were falling .
Some of the peasants went to put on their coats ; others as well as Levin felt pleasure in the refreshing rain and merely moved their shoulders up and down .
They went on mowing long and short rows , good and poor grass .
Levin had lost all count of time and had really no idea whether it was late or early .
His work was undergoing a change which gave him intense pleasure .
But as soon as he began thinking about it and trying to work better , he at once felt how hard the task was and mowed badly .
He finished a swath and was about to start another when Titus paused and went up to the old man , and both looked at the sun .
'Breakfast @-@ time , master , ' said the old man .
Only then he remembered that he had not been right about the weather and that the rain was wetting the hay .
'It won 't hurt , master . " Mow in the rain , rake when it 's fine ! " -'
Levin untied his horse and rode home to his coffee .
By the time Levin had finished breakfast Koznyshev had only just got up , and Levin went back to the meadow before Koznyshev had come to table .
His pleasant young face , with a wisp of grass tied round the forehead over his hair , worked all over with the effort ; but whenever anyone glanced at him he smiled .
Evidently he would have died rather than confess that the work was tiring .
Those were happy moments .
It 's good ! ' said he , with a wink .
And really Levin thought he had never tasted any nicer drink than this lukewarm water with green stuff floating in it and a flavour of the rusty tin box .
These were blessed moments .
It was trying only when thought became necessary in order to mow around a molehill or a space where the hard sorrel stalks had not been weeded out .
Levin and the young fellow on the other side of him found such changes of action difficult .
Both of them , having got into one strained kind of movement , were in the grip of feverish labour and had not the power to change the motion of their bodies and at the same time to observe what lay before them .
Had he been asked how long he had been mowing , he would have answered ' half an hour , ' although it was nearly noon .
'Look at the midges crawling along ! ' he said , pointing to the children and glancing at the sun from under his lifted hand .
'Come , master ! It 's dinner @-@ time , ' said he with decision .
All the mowers on reaching the river went across the swaths to where their coats lay , and where the children who had brought their dinners sat waiting for them .
Levin sat down beside them ; he did not want to go away .
Some had a wash . The young lads bathed in the river ; others arranged places for their after @-@ dinner rest , unfastened their bags of bread and unstoppered their jugs of kvas .
'Come , master , have some of my dinner , ' said he , kneeling in front of his bowl .
He shared the old man 's meal and got into conversation with him about his domestic affairs , taking a lively interest in them and telling him about his own , giving him all the particulars which would interest the old peasant .
The old man had already been long awake and sat setting the scythes for the young men .
Levin looked round and hardly recognized the place , everything was so altered .
A wide expanse of the meadow was already mown , and with its swaths of grass already giving off perfume , shone with a peculiar fresh brilliance in the oblique rays of the descending sun .
An extraordinary amount had been done by the forty @-@ two men .
The larger meadow , which in the days of serfdom had taken thirty men two days to mow , was all finished except some short patches at the corners .
But Levin wanted to get as much as possible done that day , and it was vexatious to see the sun already declining .
He was not feeling at all tired and was only longing to work again and to accomplish as much as he could .
'What do you think - could we manage to get Mashkin Heights mown to @-@ day ? ' he asked the old man .
'Now then , lads ! Keep going ! ' said Titus , starting off ahead almost at a trot .
'Go on , go on ! ' said the old man , hurrying after him and easily catching him up .
And young and old vied with each other at mowing .
But in spite of their haste they did not spoil the grass , and the swaths fell just as evenly and exactly as before .
The sun was already setting toward the trees when , with their tin boxes rattling , they entered the wooded ravine of the Heights .
The grass that in the middle of the ravine reached to their waists was delicate , soft , and broad @-@ bladed , speckled here and there with cow @-@ wheat .
After a short consultation as to whether they should mow the ravine across or lengthwise , Prokhor - a gigantic dark man and a famous mower - took the lead .
On the short swaths the mowers crowded together , their tin boxes clattering , their scythes ringing whenever they touched , the whetstones whistling upon the blades , and their merry voices resounding as they urged each other on .
Levin was again mowing between the old man and the lad .
The old man , who had put on his sheepskin jacket , was still as jolly , witty , and easy in his movements as before .
In the wood their scythes continually cut down wood mushrooms , grown plump amid the juicy grass .
The old man stooped each time he came upon one , picked it up , and put it inside his jacket , saying , ' Another treat for my old woman . ' 
It was easy to cut the wet soft grass , but on the other hand it was very difficult to go up and down the steep slopes of the ravine .
Levin followed , and often thought he would certainly fall when climbing a mound with his scythe in his hand - a mound so steep that it would have been hard to climb even unencumbered .
Levin , having regretfully taken leave of them , mounted and rode home .
'We have finished the whole of the meadow !
How delightful it is ! wonderful !
And how have you got on ? ' Levin had quite forgotten the unpleasant conversation of the previous day .
Koznyshev could not bear flies , and opened the windows in his room only at night , keeping the door carefully closed .
'No , not one , I swear .
You would not believe what enjoyment it was !
'Quite well .
But have you really been mowing all day ?
You must be as hungry as a wolf .
'No , I don 't want to eat ; I have had something there .
'What rain was that ?
So you have spent the day all right ?
That 's good . ' And Levin went off to dress .
Though Levin had imagined that he was not hungry , and sat down to table only not to offend Kuzma , yet when he began eating he thought everything delicious .
Koznyshev smiled as he looked at him
'Oh , yes , there 's a letter for you , ' said he . ' Kuzma , please bring it .
The letter was from Oblonsky .
Levin read it aloud .
She is in Ergushevo , and everything is out of gear there .
Please go and see her and help her with your advice - you know all about everything .
I will certainly go and see her , ' said Levin .
'I shall be very glad , ' replied Koznyshev , still smiling .
'I must say you have an appetite ! ' he said , glancing at the sunburnt ruddy face bent over the plate .
You would hardly believe what a remedy it is for every kind of folly .
'You would hardly require it , I should say . ' 
'Yes , it ought to be tested .
You know , I thought of coming to the meadow to have a look at you , but it was so unbearably hot that I got only as far as the forest !
'Possibly ; but it is a pleasure such as I have never in my life experienced before , and there is nothing wrong in it .
'If they don 't like it , it can 't be helped .
Besides , I think it 's all right .
'I see that on the whole you are well satisfied with your day . ' 
'Very well indeed !
We finished the meadow .
And I chummed up with such a fine old man !
You can 't imagine what a charming fellow he is . ' 
I 'll show it you .
And afterwards I thought over our yesterday 's conversation . ' 
'What about yesterday 's conversation ? ' asked Levin , who had finished dinner and sat blissfully blinking and puffing , quite unable to remember what yesterday 's conversation had been about .
'I think you are partly right .
Our disagreement lies in the fact that you consider personal interests the motive power , while I think every man with a certain degree of education ought to be interested in the general welfare .
Levin listened to his brother but understood absolutely nothing and did not wish to understand .
He was only afraid his brother might put some question which would elicit the fact that he was not paying attention .
'That 's what it is , old chap , ' said Koznyshev , patting Constantine 's shoulder .
'Yes , of course !
I don 't insist on my view , ' replied Levin , with a guilty , childlike smile .
Koznyshev smiled too . ' Shall we go for a stroll together ? ' he said , not wishing to part from his brother , who seemed to be exhaling freshness and vigour . ' Come along ! We could call in at the office if you want to . ' 
'Oh , dear me ! ' exclaimed Levin , so loudly that he scared Koznyshev .
'What 's the matter ? '
'How 's Agatha Mikhaylovna 's arm ? ' asked Levin , slapping his head . ' I had forgotten all about it . ' 
'Well , I 'll run and see her , all the same .
And his heels clattered swiftly down the stairs , making a noise like a rattle .
Some twenty years before , when Dolly was still a child , that house had seemed roomy and convenient , though in common with all houses of the kind it stood away from the drive and had not a south aspect .
It was old and beginning to decay .
In the spring , when Oblonsky went there to sell the forest , Dolly had asked him to look over the house and have all necessary repairs done .
Like all guilty husbands Oblonsky was very anxious about his wife 's comfort , so he looked over the house himself and gave orders to have everything done that seemed to him necessary .
Try as he would to be a considerate husband and father , Oblonsky never could remember that he had a wife and children .
He had the tastes of a bachelor and understood no others .
When he returned to Moscow he informed his wife that all was being prepared , that the house would look like a new toy , and advised her to move thither .
Her departure for the country suited Oblonsky in every way : it was good for the children , expenses would be cut down , and he would be freer .
Kitty wrote from her watering @-@ place that nothing seemed so attractive as spending the summer with Dolly at Ergushevo , which was full of childhood 's memories for both of them .
The first days in the country were very trying for Dolly .
But when she came there as mistress of the house she saw that things were quite different from what she had expected .
The day after her arrival it poured with rain and in the night the rain came through into the passage and nursery , so that the children 's beds had to be carried into the drawing @-@ room .
There were no eggs .
No peasant women could be got to scrub the floors : they were all out planting potatoes .
There was nowhere to hang dresses , because what few wardrobes there were would not shut , or else opened of themselves when anyone passed by .
There was no mangle in the laundry , not even an ironing board , and no large pots or pans .
The position seemed irremediable ; but just as in other households , there was here in the Oblonskys ' house one inconspicuous yet most important and useful person : Matrena Filimonovna .
She consoled her mistress , assuring her that everything would ' shape itself ( this phrase was her own , and Matthew had learnt it from her ) , and she went to work deliberately and without excitement .
She at once made friends with the steward 's wife , and on the very day of the removal drank tea with her and with the steward beneath the laburnums , discussing arrangements .
'There , you see ! And you were quite in despair ! ' said Matrena Filimonovna , pointing to the board .
Lily started bathing , and at least part of Dolly 's expectations were fulfilled , if not that of a quiet , at least that of a comfortable , country life .
Very , very rare were the short intervals of quiet .
But these cares and anxieties were the only kind of happiness possible for Dolly .
Had it not been for them she would have been left to her thoughts about the husband who did not love her .
Now in the country solitude she grew more often aware of these joys .
AT THE END OF MAY , when the house was more or less in order , Dolly received from her husband an answer to her letter of complaint .
He wrote asking her to forgive his not having seen to everything , and saying that he would come as soon as possible .
On the Sunday before St Peter 's Day Dolly took all her children to Communion .
She had a strange religion of her own , firmly believing in the transmigration of souls , and not caring about Church dogmas .
Several days previously she decided how all the children should be dressed .
New frocks were made , old ones altered , hems and frills let down , buttons sewn on , and ribbons got ready .
One of the frocks , which the English governess had undertaken to alter , was the cause of much bad blood .
The governess put the bodice darts in the wrong places , cut out the arm @-@ holes too big , and nearly spoilt the dress .
The frock was put right but it very nearly caused a quarrel with the governess .
Dolly , somewhat excited , had dressed and done her hair with care .
She was not dressing for her own sake , not for her own beauty , but in order , as the mother of all those charming children , not to spoil the general effect .
She gave her mirror a last glance and was satisfied with herself .
She looked well : not in the way she had wished to look when going to a ball , but well for the object she had in view at present .
There was no one in church except peasants , innkeepers and their womenfolk ; but Dolly saw , or thought she saw , the rapture produced in them by her children and herself .
The children were not only beautiful in their fine clothes but were also very sweet in their behaviour .
It 's true Alesha did not stand very well : he kept turning round to see the back of his jacket ; but nevertheless he was wonderfully sweet .
Little Lily was charming in her naive wonder at everything around , and it was difficult to repress a smile when , having swallowed the bread and wine , she said in English , ' More , please ! '
On the way home the children were very quiet , feeling that something solemn had taken place .
At home also all went well , only at lunch Grisha began whistling and - what was still worse - would not obey the governess and had to go without his pudding .
Dolly would not have sanctioned any punishment on such a day had she been present , but she was obliged to support the governess and so confirmed the sentence that Grisha was not to have pudding .
This rather spoilt the general joyfulness .
This was too sad , and Dolly decided to speak to the governess and get her to forgive Grisha , and went off to find her .
But as she was passing through the dancing @-@ room she saw a scene which filled her heart with such joy that tears came to her eyes and she pardoned the little culprit herself .
On the plea of giving her dolls some dinner she had obtained leave from the governess to take her plateful of pudding to the nursery , but had brought it to her brother instead .
Still crying over the injustice done him , he ate the pudding , muttering between sobs : ' Eat some yourself ... let us both eat ... together ! '
Tanya , affected first by pity for Grisha and then by the consciousness of her own virtuous action , also had tears in her eyes , but did not decline to eat her share of the pudding .
Your nice white frock !
Grisha ! ' cried their mother , trying to save the frock , but smiling a blissful , rapturous smile .
The sound of rapturous squealing filled the nursery , and did not cease till they started on their drive .
They gathered a basketful of mushrooms ; even Lily found one .
Previously Miss Hull used to find one and point it out to her ; but this time Lily herself found a fine big one and there was a general shout of delight : ' Lily has found a mushroom ! '
When half the children were dressed again , some smartly @-@ dressed peasant women who had been gathering herbs came up and halted shyly by the bathing @-@ house .
Matrena Filimonovna called to one of these to ask her to dry a bath @-@ sheet and a chemise that had fallen into the water , and Dolly entered into conversation with them .
The peasant women , who had begun by laughing behind their hands without comprehending her questions , soon became bolder and more talkative , and at once captivated Dolly by their frank admiration of her children .
'Just look at the little beauty , as white as sugar ! ' said one , gazing admiringly at Tanya and stroking her head . ' But she 's thin . ' 
'No , she is only three months old , ' Dolly answered proudly .
'Dear me ! '
'And have you any children ? '
'I had four ; two are left , a boy and a girl .
I weaned her in the spring . ' 
'How old is she ? '
'Why did you nurse her so long ? '
'It 's our custom . ' 
And the conversation turned upon the topic that interested Dolly more than any other : confinements , children 's illnesses , husbands ' whereabouts , and whether they came home often .
Dolly did not want to part from the peasant women ; their conversation pleased her so much because their interests were exactly similar to hers .
The women amused her and offended the English governess , who noticed that she was the object of their laughter , which she did not understand .
She was always glad to see him , but on this day was more pleased than ever because he would now see her in all her glory .
No one could understand the dignity of her position better than Levin .
On seeing her he found himself confronted by just such a picture of family life as his fancy painted .
'You 're glad , yet you never sent me word .
My brother is staying with me .
'From Stephen ? ' asked Dolly in a surprised tone .
He was confused because he imagined that Dolly might not like to accept the help of a stranger in matters that ought to be attended to by her husband .
She really did not like the way Oblonsky had of forcing his family affairs upon strangers , and knew at once that Levin understood this .
It was for his quick perception and delicacy of feeling that Dolly liked him .
'Of course I understood that this only meant you wanted to see me , and was very pleased .
I can well imagine how strange everything here must seem to you , used as you are to managing a town house ; and if you require anything I am quite at your disposal . ' 
She knew him , knew that he would be a good match for the young lady , and hoped the affair would come off .
'No , I will walk .
Children , who will race the horses with me ? '
Whatever Levin 's defects may have been , there was not a trace of pretence about him ; therefore the children evinced toward him the same friendliness that they saw in their mother 's face .
The two eldest , responding to his invitation , at once jumped out to him and ran with him as they would have done with their nurse , Miss Hull , or their mother .
Lily wanted to go too , and her mother handed her to him ; he put her on his shoulder and ran on .
'Don 't be afraid ! Don 't be afraid , Darya Alexandrovna ! There 's no fear of my hurting or dropping her , ' said he , smiling brightly at the mother .
And as she looked at his easy , strong , considerate , careful and ultra @-@ cautious movements , the mother lost her fears and looked at them with a smile of approval .
He ran about with the children , taught them gymnastics , amused Miss Hull by his broken English and talked to Dolly about his rural occupations .
'Really ? ' said he , flushing up ; and to change the subject he at once added : ' Well , then , shall I send you two cows ?
If you insist on squaring accounts , pay me five roubles a month , if your conscience allows it . ' 
'No , thank you .
'Well , then , I will just have a look at your cows and , with your permission , will give directions about the feeding .
To change the conversation Levin went on to explain to Dolly a theory of dairy farming which maintained that a cow was only a machine for the transformation of fodder into milk , and so on .
While saying all that , he was passionately longing and yet dreading to hear every particular concerning Kitty .
He feared that the peace of mind he had acquired with so much effort might be destroyed .
'Yes , but all that has to be looked after , and who is going to do it ? ' remarked Dolly unwillingly .
Having with Matrena Filimonovna 's help got her household into working order , she did not care to make any change ; besides , she had no confidence in Levin 's knowledge of farming .
Arguments about cows being milk @-@ producing machines did not commend themselves to her , for she imagined that such arguments were calculated only to interfere with farming .
That was clear .
But arguments about cereal and grass feeding were questionable and vague and , above all , she was anxious to talk about Kitty .
'And her health ! Is she better ? ' asked Levin anxiously .
'Yes , thank God ! she has quite recovered .
I never believed that she had lung trouble . ' 
'Oh , I am so glad ! ' said Levin , and Dolly thought she saw something pathetic and helpless in his face as he said it , and then silently looked at her .
'Tell me , Constantine Dmitrich , ' said Dolly with her kind though slightly ironical smile , ' why are you angry with Kitty ? '
I am not angry , ' said Levin .
'Yes , you are .
Why did you not call either on us or on them when you were in Moscow ? '
'Darya Alexandrovna , ' said he , blushing to the roots of his hair , ' I am surprised that one so kind as you are should not feel what the reason was .
How is it that you have no pity for me , knowing as you do ... '
'You know I proposed and was rejected , ' muttered Levin , and the tenderness he had a moment ago felt for Kitty was changed into a feeling of anger at the insult .
'Why did you think I knew ? '
'Because everybody knows it . ' 
'In that , at any rate , you are mistaken ; I did not know it , though I had my suspicions . ' 
'Well , anyhow you know it now . ' 
'All I knew was that something had happened that tormented her dreadfully , and she asked me never to speak about it .
Well , what did happen between you ?
'I have told you what happened . ' 
'When I last visited you . ' 
'Do you know , ' said Dolly , ' I am terribly , terribly sorry for her !
You are suffering only through pride ... '
'That may be , ' said Levin , ' but ... '
Now I understand everything . ' 
'Well , Darya Alexandrovna , please excuse me ! ' he said rising .
'No , wait a bit , ' she answered , holding him by the sleeve . ' Wait a bit . Sit down . ' 
'Please , please don 't let us talk about it ! ' said he , sitting down again , conscious as he did so that a hope which he had thought dead and buried was waking and stirring within him .
'If I did not care for you , ' Dolly went on , the tears rising to her eyes , ' if I did not know you as well as I do ... '
The feeling that seemed dead was coming to life again , rising and taking possession of Levin 's heart .
'Yes , now I understand it all , ' continued Dolly . ' You can 't understand it , you men who are free and have the choice .
'Well , it 's not quite like that . ' 
'Never mind ! You propose when your love is ripe or when the balance falls in favour of one of those between whom your choice lies .
But a girl is not asked .
She is expected to choose for herself , yet she has no choice ; she can only say " Yes " or " No . " -'
'Yes , a choice between me and Vronsky , ' thought Levin , and the dead hope that had begun to revive in his soul died again and only weighed painfully on his heart .
'Darya Alexandrovna , ' said he , ' in that way one may choose a dress , or ... purchases ... anything ... but not love .
The choice is made , and so much the better ... a repetition is impossible . ' 
She had said , ' No , it cannot be . ' 
'Darya Alexandrovna , ' he replied drily , ' I value your confidence in me , but think you are mistaken .
Whether I am right or wrong , that pride which you so despise makes any thought of your sister impossible for me - do you understand me ? - perfectly impossible . ' 
'I will only add just this : you understand that I am speaking about my sister , whom I love as much as my own children .
I do not say she loves you ; I only wished to tell you that her refusal proves nothing . ' 
'I don 't know ! ' said Levin , jumping up . ' If you know how you hurt me !
Of course I will not avoid her , but whenever I can I will try to save her the unpleasantness of meeting me . ' 
'I am speaking French , and you must answer in French . ' 
The little girl had forgotten the French for spade , so her mother told her and went on to say , still in French , where she would find the spade .
All this was disagreeable to Levin .
Nothing in Dolly 's house , or about her children seemed half as charming as before .
'Why does she talk French with the children ? ' he thought . ' How unnatural and false it is !
And the children feel it .
'Where are you hurrying to ?
So Levin stayed to tea , though his bright spirits had quite vanished and he felt ill at ease .
After tea he went out to tell his coachman to harness and when he returned he found Dolly excited , a worried look on her face and tears in her eyes .
In Levin 's absence an event took place which suddenly put an end to the joy and pride that Dolly had been feeling all day .
Grisha and Tanya had a fight about a ball .
Dolly , hearing their screams , ran up to the nursery and found them in a dreadful state .
Tanya was holding Grisha by the hair , and he , his face distorted with anger , was hitting her at random with his fists .
She could think and speak of nothing else , and yet could not tell Levin her trouble .
IN THE MIDDLE OF JULY the Elder from the village belonging to Levin 's sister ( which lay fifteen miles from Pokrovsk ) came to see Levin and report on business matters and on the hay @-@ harvest .
When Levin took over the management of the estate he looked into the matter , and , concluding that the grass was worth more , fixed the price at eight roubles .
The peasants would not pay so much , and Levin suspected them of keeping other buyers off .
The local men opposed this innovation by all the means in their power , but the plan succeeded , and in the first year the meadows brought in almost double .
The next and third years the peasants still held out and the harvest was got in by the same means .
There were only thirty @-@ two loads in the stack .
After lengthy disputes it was settled that the peasants themselves should take those eleven stacks , counting them at fifty loads each and that the owner 's share should be measured afresh .
Men with hayforks followed the women , and the ridges grew into tall , wide and light haycocks .
To the left , carts rattled along the bare meadow , and one after another the haycocks vanished , picked up in enormous forkfuls , and their places were taken by heavy carts with their huge loads of scented hay overhanging the horses ' backs .
'Make hay while the sun shines , and you 'll have plenty , ' remarked the old beekeeper , sitting down beside Levin . ' It 's more like tea than hay !
Is that the last ? ' he shouted to a lad who was driving past , standing on the front of a cart and flicking the ends of his hempen reins .
'My youngest , ' replied the old man with a smile of affection .
'A fine fellow ! '
'Yes , just over two years . ' 
'Have they any children ? '
All the first year he didn 't understand anything ; and we chaffed him , ' answered the old man .
Levin looked more attentively at Vanka Parmenich and his wife .
Vanka stood inside the cart patting and stamping down evenly in the cart the enormous bales of hay which his young wife first passed to him in armfuls and then pitched up on the fork .
The young woman was working with ease , cheerfulness and skill .
Vanka , with evident desire to save her every moment of unnecessary exertion , hurriedly caught the hay in his outspread arms and smoothed it evenly in the cart .
Vanka showed her how to do this , and burst out laughing at something she said .
Strong , young , newly @-@ awakened love shone in both their faces .
Having come out upon the road , Vanka took his place in the line of carts .
The women , carrying their rakes over their shoulders , followed the carts , their coloured dresses gleaming brightly and their chatter ringing merrily .
The singing women were drawing nearer to Levin and he felt as if a thundercloud of merriment were approaching .
Levin envied them their healthy gaiety and felt a wish to take part in that expression of the joy of living ; but he could do nothing except lie and look and listen .
When the company and their songs vanished out of sight and hearing , an oppressive feeling of discontent with his own lonely lot , his physical idleness and his hostility to the world overcame Levin .
All had been drowned in the sea of their joyful common toil .
The old man who had been sitting beside him had long since gone home .
Levin , unnoticed by them , still lay on the haycock , looking , listening , and thinking .
The peasants who were staying in the meadow kept awake almost all the short summer night .
The whole long day of toil had left upon them no trace of anything but merriment .
The sounds of night - the ceaseless croaking of frogs , the snorting of horses through the morning mist over the meadow - could alone be heard .
Awaking to reality Levin rose from his haycock , and glancing up at the stars realized that the night was nearly over .
'Well , then , what shall I do ?
How shall I do it ? ' he asked himself , trying to find expression for what he had been thinking and the feelings he had lived through in that short night .
All his ideas and feelings separated themselves into three different lines of thought .
The first was how to renounce his old life and discard his quite useless education .
This renunciation would afford him pleasure and was quite easy and simple .
The second was concerned with his notion of the life he now wished to lead .
He was distinctly conscious of the simplicity , purity , and rightness of that life , and was convinced that in it he would find satisfaction , peace , and dignity , the absence of which was so painful to him .
But the third thought was the question of how to make the change from his present life to that other one .
And here no clear idea presented itself to his mind .
Should he have a wife ?
One thing is certain : this night has decided my fate .
All my former dreams of a family life were nonsense - not the right thing . Everything is much simpler and better than that ... '
And how did this shell get formed so quickly ?
A little while ago when I looked at the sky all was clear , but for two white strips .
My views of life have changed in just the same unnoticeable way . ' 
Leaving the meadow , he went down the high road toward the village .
A slight breeze was blowing and all looked grey and dull .
At a distance of forty paces along the road on which he was walking he saw a coach with four horses abreast and luggage on top approaching him .
The horses were pressing close together away from the ruts , but the skilful driver , sitting sideways on the box , guided them so that the coach wheels ran smoothly in the ruts .
That was all Levin noticed , and without wondering who might be inside he glanced in at the window absent @-@ mindedly .
In one corner an elderly woman was dozing ; and close to the window sat a young girl who had just wakened and was holding the ribbons of her white nightcap with both hands .
Bright and thoughtful , full of that complicated refinement of a life to which Levin was a stranger , she looked across him at the glow of dawn .
At the very moment when this vision was about to disappear , her candid eyes fell on him .
She recognized him and joyful surprise lit up her face .
He could not be mistaken .
There were no other eyes in the world like them .
In the whole world there was only one being able to unite in itself the universe and the meaning of life for him .
It was Kitty .
He guessed that she was on her way from the station to her sister 's house at Ergushevo .
All that had so disturbed Levin during the sleepless night and all his resolutions vanished suddenly .
He recalled with disgust his thoughts of marrying a peasant girl .
There alone , inside that coach on the other side of the road , so rapidly receding from him , was the one possible solution of that riddle which had been weighing on him so painfully of late .
The barking of dogs proved that the coach was passing through the village , and only the empty fields , the village before him , and he himself walking solitary on the deserted road , were left .
'No , ' said he to himself . ' Beautiful as is that life of simplicity and toil , I cannot turn to it .
I love her ! '
NONE BUT THOSE WHO KNEW KARENIN most intimately knew that this apparently cold and sober @-@ minded man had one weakness , quite inconsistent with the general trend of his character .
Karenin could not with equanimity hear or see a child or a woman weeping .
The sight of tears upset him and made him quite incapable of reasoning .
'He will get angry and won 't listen to you , ' they said ; and in such cases the mental perturbation which tears produced in Karenin really found expression in hurried bursts of anger .
'I can do nothing for you .
Kindly go away ! ' he would shout on these occasions .
That was the cause of the strange deathlike look on his face which had so struck Anna .
His wife 's words , confirming as they did his worst suspicions , had given Karenin a cruel pain in his heart .
This pain was rendered more acute by physical pity for her , evoked by her tears .
What Karenin experienced was a feeling of this kind : it had been a strange and terrible pain , but it was past , and he felt he could again live , and think of other things beside his wife .
'Without honour , without heart , without religion ; a depraved woman !
I knew it and could see it all along , though I tried out of pity for her to deceive myself , ' thought he .
'I made a mistake when I bound up my life with hers , but in my mistake there was nothing blameworthy , therefore I ought not to be unhappy .
What would happen to her and to her son , toward whom his feelings had changed as they had toward her , no longer occupied his mind .
Yes , even Dram - that honest , business @-@ like fellow ...
'It is a misfortune that may befall anyone and it has befallen me .
The only question is , how best to face the situation . ' 
And he began mentally reviewing the courses pursued by other men in similar positions .
'Daryalov fought a duel ... '
In his youth Karenin had been particularly attracted by the idea of duelling , just because he was physically a timid man and was quite aware of it .
He could not think without horror of a pistol being levelled at him and had never used any kind of weapon .
Nevertheless , I shall have to decide what to do with her .
Then I , an innocent man , should be the victim .
And this is not all . A challenge from me would not be an honest action .
Do I not know beforehand that my friends would never allow me to go so far as to fight a duel , would not allow a statesman whom Russia needs to expose himself to danger ?
This would happen : I , knowing beforehand that matters would never be allowed to reach a dangerous point , should have challenged a man in order to cover myself with false glamour .
No ! a duel is unthinkable and no one expects it of me .
My aim is to safeguard my reputation , which I need for the uninterrupted pursuit of my career . ' 
His official pursuits , which had always appeared essential to Karenin , now assumed even greater importance .
Having considered and rejected the idea of a duel , Karenin turned his thoughts to divorce , the next expedient of which some of the wronged husbands he remembered had availed themselves .
In all these cases the husband had ceded or sold the unfaithful wife , and the very person who according to law had no right to re @-@ marry entered into fictitious , pseudo @-@ legal relations with a pretended husband .
Karenin saw that in his own case it would be impossible to obtain a legal divorce - that is , a divorce in which the guilty wife would be simply cast off .
To attempt a divorce could only lead to a lawsuit and a scandal which would give his enemies great opportunity for calumny , and would lower his high position in Society .
Besides , it was evident that as a consequence of divorce the wife would break off relations with her husband and unite with her lover .
'No , it is impossible , impossible ! ' he said aloud , again wrapping the rug round his legs , ' I cannot be unhappy , but she and he must not be happy . ' 
The jealousy that had tormented him during the period of uncertainty had left him when his wife 's words had with great pain drawn that aching tooth .
But another feeling had now taken the place of the jealousy : it was a wish that his wife 's guilt should meet with retribution .
He did not acknowledge it to himself , but in the depths of his soul he wished her to suffer for impairing his peace of mind and his honour .
Proceeding to consider further details , Karenin could not even see why his relations with his wife should not remain almost the same as before .
She must be unhappy , but I am not guilty and therefore I cannot suffer . ' 
BY THE TIME HE REACHED PETERSBURG Karenin had not only resolved to keep to his decision , but had mentally composed a letter to his wife .
On entering the hall of his house he glanced at the letters and papers which had been sent from the Ministry and ordered them to be brought into his study .
'Tell him to unharness ; and no one is to be admitted , ' he said in answer to the hall @-@ porter 's inquiry , accentuating with a certain pleasure the word admitted . It was a sign that he was in good spirits .
He paced twice up and down his study and then halted at the gigantic writing @-@ table , on which his valet had already lit six candles . Cracking his fingers , he sat down and arranged his writing materials .
With his elbow on the table and his head bent to one side he sat and thought for a minute , and then wrote without an instant 's pause .
He did not begin by addressing her , and wrote in French , using the plural pronoun you , which in French does not sound as cold and distant as it does in Russian .
'During our last conversation I expressed my intention of communicating my decision with reference to the subject of that conversation .
Having carefully and fully considered everything , I now write to fulfil my promise .
My decision is as follows : Whatever your actions may have been , I do not consider myself justified in severing the bonds with which a Higher Power has united us .
A family must not be broken up through the caprice , perversity , or even crime , of one of the married couple , and our life must go on as heretofore .
This is unavoidable for my sake , for yours , and for that of our son .
If not , you can yourself foresee what awaits you and your son .
As the summer season is drawing to a close , I would ask you to return to Petersburg as soon as possible , and not later than Tuesday .
All necessary preparations shall be made for your return .
I beg you to note that I attach importance to this request of mine .
'P.S. - I enclose some money , which you may need for your expenses . ' 
He read the letter over and was satisfied with it , especially with having remembered to enclose the money ; there was not a single cruel word or threat in it , yet it was not yielding in tone .
Above all it provided a golden bridge for her to return by .
'Yes , your Excellency ! shall tea be served in the study ? '
Karenin assented , and , toying with his paper @-@ knife , went to his arm @-@ chair , beside which a lamp was burning and a French book about the Eugubine Tables was lying ready .
Above the arm @-@ chair hung a beautifully painted portrait of Anna by a celebrated artist .
After looking at the portrait for about a minute he shuddered and his lips trembled and made a sound like ' brr ' as he turned away .
He sat down hurriedly and opened his book .
He tried to read but could not awaken in himself the lively interest he had felt for the Eugubine Tables .
He was not thinking of his wife but of a complication that had recently arisen in his official activity and at present constituted the chief interest of his work .
As soon as the footman , who had brought in the tea , had left the room , Karenin rose and went to the writing @-@ table .
Karenin knew that this was really so .
A great deal of money had been and was being spent quite unproductively on that business , and it was evident that the scheme would lead to nothing .
Like all such matters it went on of itself , by inertia .
( Many people lived by it , especially one very moral and musical family in which the daughters all played stringed instruments .
Karenin was acquainted with that family and gave away one of the daughters at her marriage . )
The raising of this question by a hostile Department was , in Karenin 's opinion , dishonest , because in every Ministry there were still graver matters which , out of recognized official decency , no one ever questioned .
The case of the subject races had been accidentally raised at the Committee of 2nd June and had been energetically insisted on by Karenin , as a matter of urgency in view of their wretched condition .
At the Committee this question had caused conflict between several Ministries .
A flush of animation suffused Karenin 's face as he rapidly wrote out a summary of these ideas .
After walking up and down the room he again looked at the portrait , frowned , and smiled contemptuously .
On her way back from the races , in a moment of excitement in spite of the pain it caused her - she had told her husband everything , and she was glad she had done so .
After he left her , she told herself that she was glad she had told him , that now everything would be definite - at any rate , the falsehood and deception would no longer exist .
She thought it quite certain that her position would be cleared up for good .
Her new position might be a bad one but it would be definite , and there would be no vagueness or falsehood .
The pain she had inflicted on herself and her husband would now , she thought , be compensated for by the fact that the matter would be settled .
She saw Vronsky that same evening , but did not tell him what had passed between her and her husband , though he would have to be told before her position could be settled .
But the words had been spoken and Karenin had gone away without saying anything .
And in answer to this question a hot blush of shame spread all over her face .
She knew what had stopped her , knew she had been ashamed .
The situation which the night before had appeared to be clearing up now seemed quite hopeless .
When she thought of what her husband would do , the most terrible fancies came into her head .
She fancied that presently the steward would come and turn her out of the house and that her disgrace would be proclaimed to all the world .
When she thought about Vronsky , she imagined that he did not love her , that he was beginning to find her a burden , and that she could not offer herself to him ; and in consequence she felt hostile toward him .
She felt as if the words she had used to her husband , which she kept repeating in imagination , had been said by her to every one and that every one had heard them .
She had not the courage to look into the eyes of the people she lived with .
Anna looked inquiringly into her eyes and blushed with alarm .
The maid begged pardon and said she thought she had heard the bell .
She brought a dress and a note .
The note was from Betsy , who reminded her that she ( Betsy ) was that day expecting Lisa Merkalova and the Baroness Stolz , with their admirers Kaluzhsky and old Stremov , to a game of croquet .
Anna read the note and sighed deeply . ' I don 't want anything , anything at all , ' she said to Annushka , who was moving the bottles and brushes on the dressing table .
'Oh , my God !
My God ! ' she kept repeating , but neither the word God or my had any meaning for her .
She knew that she could find no help in religion unless she was prepared to give up that which alone gave a meaning to her life .
She was not only disturbed , but was beginning to be afraid of a new mental condition such as she had never before experienced .
She felt as if everything was being doubled in her soul , just as objects appear doubled to weary eyes .
'Oh , dear ! What am I doing ! ' she said to herself suddenly , feeling pain in both sides of her head .
When she came to her senses she found that she was clutching her hair and pressing her temples with both hands .
'Coffee is ready , and Ma 'm'selle and Serezha are waiting , ' said Annushka , coming in again and finding Anna in the same position .
Anna asked , reviving suddenly , as for the first time that morning she remembered the existence of her son .
'It seems he has got into trouble , ' answered Annushka with a smile .
'You had some peaches in the corner room ; it seems he has eaten one of them on the quiet . ' 
The thought of her son at once took Anna out of the hopeless condition she had been in .
Whatever position she might accept she could not give up her son .
She must be calm and escape from this terrible situation .
She dressed quickly and with determined steps entered the drawing @-@ room , where Serezha and his governess were waiting breakfast for her as usual .
His governess was looking exceptionally stern .
The governess began to give a long and detailed account of his misconduct , but Anna did not listen to her . She was wondering whether to take her also or not .
'No , I won 't , ' she decided . ' I will go alone with my son . ' 
I ... I ... ' he said , trying to find out from her face what he was to expect for eating the peach .
'Serezha , ' she said as soon as the governess had gone away , ' it was wrong , but you won 't do it again ? ... You love me ? '
The tears were already streaming down her cheeks , and in order to hide them she jumped up abruptly and went out on to the verandah .
She shivered with cold , and with the terror that seized her with new power out in the open air .
'Go to Mariette , ' she said to Serezha , who had come out after her , and she began pacing up and down the straw matting of the verandah .
'Is it possible that they could not forgive me or understand that it could not have been otherwise ? ' she asked herself .
'No , no , I must not think , ' she said to herself ; ' I must get ready to go .
'To Moscow ? Yes , by the evening train , with Annushka and Serezha , and with only the most necessary things .
But first I must write to both of them . ' 
She quickly went to her sitting @-@ room and wrote to her husband .
'After what has happened I can no longer remain in your house .
I am going away and taking my son .
I do not know the law and therefore I do not know to which of his parents a son must be left , but I am taking him because I cannot live without him .
Be generous and leave him to me ! '
Up to that point she wrote quickly and naturally , but the appeal to his generosity , in which she did not believe , and the necessity of finishing the letter with something moving , stopped her ...
'I cannot speak of my fault and my repentance because ... '
She stopped again , unable to connect her thoughts .
'I have informed my husband , ' she began , and was unable to write any more .
It seemed so coarse and unwomanly .
'Besides , what can I write to him ? ' she asked herself ; and again she blushed with shame .
She thought of his calmness , and a feeling of vexation with him made her tear the paper to pieces , with the one sentence written on it .
'There is no need to write anything , ' she thought , closed her blotting @-@ book , went upstairs to tell the governess and the servants that she was going to Moscow that evening , and then began packing .
IN ALL THE ROOMS of the country house porters , gardeners , and footmen went about carrying out the things .
Cupboards and chests of drawers stood open , twice the nearest shop had been sent to for balls of string . The floor was strewn with newspapers .
Anna looked out and saw Karenin 's messenger in the porch ringing the bell .
'Go and see what it is , ' she said , and , calmly prepared for anything , sat down in an easy @-@ chair and folded her hands on her knees .
A footman brought her a thick envelope addressed in her husband 's handwriting .
'The messenger has been told to wait for an answer , ' he said .
'All right , ' she replied , and as soon as he had gone she tore open the envelope with trembling fingers .
A packet of new still unfolded notes in a paper band fell out .
I beg you will note that I attach importance to this request of mine , ' she read .
Having glanced through it , she went back and read it again from the beginning .
When she had finished she felt cold , and knew that a more dreadful misfortune had befallen her than she had ever expected .
Yes , a mean , horrid man !
And no one but I understands or will understand it , and I cannot explain it .
They say he 's a religious , moral , honest , and wise man , but they do not see what I have seen .
They do not know how for eight years he has been smothering my life , smothering everything that was alive in me , that he never once thought I was a live woman , in need of love .
They do not know how at every step he hurt me and remained self @-@ satisfied .
Have I not tried , tried with all my might , to find a purpose in my life ?
Have I not tried to love him , tried to love my son when I could no longer love my husband ?
But the time came when I understood that I could no longer deceive myself that I am alive , and cannot be blamed because God made me so , that I want to love and to live .
If he killed me - if he had killed him , - I would have borne anything , I would have forgiven anything ! But no !
He will do what is consistent with his low nature .
But don 't I know why he said it ? He does not believe in my love for my son or he despises it .
'That life was painful before , lately it has been dreadful . What will it be now ?
I know him ; I know that he swims and delights in falsehood as a fish does in water . But no !
I will not give him that pleasure , come what will . I will break this web of lies in which he wishes to entangle me .
Was a woman ever as unhappy as I am ? ...
No , I shall break it off , break it off ! ' she exclaimed , jumping up and forcing back her tears .
She sat down at her writing @-@ table , but instead of writing she folded her arms on the table and put her head on them , and began to cry , sobbing with her whole bosom heaving , as a child cries .
She knew beforehand that everything would remain as it was and would be even far worse than before .
She knew that it would be so , and yet it was so terrible that she could not even imagine how it would end .
And she cried , without restraint , like a punished child .
The approaching step of the footman recalled her to herself , and hiding her face from him she pretended to be writing .
'The messenger is asking for the answer , ' he said .
Yes , let him wait : I will ring , ' said Anna .
That I am in love ? '
And she felt again a schism in her soul , and again was frightened by the feeling ; so she seized the first pretext for action that occurred to her to divert her thoughts from herself .
'I must see Alexis , ' as she called Vronsky in her thoughts . ' He alone can tell me what to do .
She wrote to her husband : ' I have received your letter . - A. , ' rang , and gave the note to the footman .
'No , but don 't unpack till to @-@ morrow , and let the carriage wait .
'What dress shall I put out ? '
THE CROQUET MATCH to which the Princess Tverskaya had invited Anna was to be played by two ladies and their admirers .
The two ladies were the chief representatives of a choice new Petersburg circle called , in imitation of an imitation of something , Les sept merveilles du monde .
These ladies belonged to a circle which , though higher , was entirely hostile to the set Anna frequented .
Old Stremov - one of Petersburg 's influential men , and Lisa Merkalova 's adorer - was also officially hostile to Karenin .
These considerations had made Anna reluctant to come , and it was to her refusal that the hints in Princess Tverskaya 's note had referred .
But now the hope of seeing Vronsky had brought Anna .
She arrived at the Princess Tverskaya 's house before the other visitors .
Just as she arrived Vronsky 's footman , who with his well @-@ brushed whiskers looked like a Gentleman of the Bedchamber , also came up .
He stopped at the door , took off his cap , and let her pass .
Anna saw him , and only then remembered that the evening before Vronsky had said that he was not coming .
Probably he had sent a note to say so .
As she was taking off her outdoor things in the hall she heard the footman - who even pronounced his r 's like a Gentleman of the Bedchamber - say : ' From the Count to the Princess , ' as he delivered the note .
She felt inclined to ask where his master was ; she wanted to go home and write to him to come to her house , or to go to him herself . But none of these things could be done .
Will you not come into the garden ? ' said another footman in the next room .
Everything did itself .
When she met Betsy coming toward her in a white costume that struck Anna by its elegance , Anna smiled at her as usual .
There must have been something unusual about Anna 's look , for Betsy noticed it at once .
'I have slept badly , ' answered Anna , gazing at the footman , who she guessed was bringing Vronsky 's note .
Why she had said something she had not even thought of a moment before she could not have explained .
Her only reason for saying it was that since Vronsky was not coming she must secure her freedom and try to see him in some other way .
'No , I won 't let you go on any account , ' said Betsy , fixing her eyes intently on Anna . ' I should be really hurt , if I were not so fond of you .
She took the note from him and read it . ' Alexis has failed us , ' she said in French .
Anna was aware that Betsy knew everything , but when she heard her talk about Vronsky she always felt a momentary conviction that Betsy knew nothing about it .
'No ! Perhaps you do not want to meet Stremov ?
Let him and Alexis Alexandrovich break lances at their Committee Meetings ; that has nothing to do with us .
In Society he is the most amiable man I know , and a passionate croquet player .
You 'll see !
And in spite of his ridiculous position as Lisa 's old admirer , you should see how he carries it off .
He is very charming .
Sappho Stolz you do not know ?
She is quite a new type . ' 
While Betsy was saying this Anna saw by her bright intelligent look that she partly understood Anna 's position and was devising something .
They were in a small sitting @-@ room .
'But I must write to Alexis ; ' and Betsy sat down at the table , wrote a few words , and put the paper in an envelope .
Without thinking for an instant Anna sat down at the table with Betsy 's note , and without reading it added at the bottom : ' I must see you .
I shall be there at six . ' 
She closed it , and Betsy returning sent it off in her presence .
'She is very nice and was always attractive to me , ' said Anna .
'You must love her : she dotes on you .
She said that you are a real heroine for a novel , and that were she a man she would have committed a thousand follies for your sake .
Stremov tells her she is committing them as it is ! '
I have not often met them ...
What are they ? '
Betsy looked at her with smiling eyes .
'It is a new fashion , ' she replied .
'They have all adopted that fashion .
'Yes , but what are her relations with Kaluzhsky ? '
Betsy burst into an unexpected , merry and uncontrollable peal of laughter , a thing she rarely did .
'You are encroaching on the Princess Myagkaya 's domain !
'It is all very well for you to laugh , ' said Anna , who could not help laughing too , ' but I never was able to understand it .
I cannot understand the husband 's position . ' 
'The husband 's !
Lisa Merkalova 's husband carries her rugs after her and is always at her service .
But what there is behind it all , no one really cares to know .
Don 't you know that in good Society no one talks or even thinks about certain details of the toilet ?
'Will you be at Rolandaki 's fate ? ' asked Anna in order to change the subject .
'I don 't think so , ' answered Betsy , and while looking at her friend she began filling the little translucent cup with aromatic tea .
'You see , ' she said , ' I am in a lucky position ! I understand you and I understand Lisa .
Lisa 's is one of those naive natures who , like children , are unable to understand the difference between right and wrong .
At least she did not understand it when she was very young .
And now she knows that that role of not understanding becomes her .
Now perhaps she is purposely ingenuous , ' and Betsy smiled pointedly . ' But still it becomes her .
You see a thing may be looked at tragically and turned to a torment , or looked at quite simply , and even gaily .
Perhaps you are inclined to take things too tragically . ' 
SOUNDS OF FOOTSTEPS and a man 's voice , then that of a woman followed by laughter , reached them , and the expected visitors entered the room , Sappho Stolz and a young man , shining with a superabundance of health , known as Vaska .
It was evident that he flourished on underdone beef , truffles , and Burgundy .
He came into the drawing @-@ room behind Sappho and followed her across the room as if he were tied to her , with his glittering eye fixed on her as if he were ready to eat her .
Sappho Stolz had fair hair and black eyes .
She entered with a short , brisk step , in shoes with high French heels and shook hands with the ladies with a firm grip like a man .
Anna had never met this celebrity before , and was struck by her beauty , by the extravagant fashion of her costume , and by the boldness of her manners .
Betsy hastened to introduce her to Anna .
Vaska again bowed to Anna , but said nothing .
He turned to Sappho : ' You have lost the bet : we have arrived first .
Pay up ! ' he said smiling .
Sappho laughed still more merrily .
'Surely not now ! ' she said .
'Never mind , I will have it later . ' 
'All right ! All right !
I have brought you a visitor !
The unexpected young visitor Sappho had brought with her and forgotten was nevertheless so important a personage that , in spite of his youth , both ladies rose to greet him .
He was Sappho 's new admirer , and followed at her heels just like Vaska .
Then the Prince Kaluzhsky arrived , and Lisa Merkalova with Stremov .
Lisa Merkalova was a slight brunette with a lazy Oriental type of face and beautiful ( everybody said unfathomable ) eyes .
The character of her dark costume , as Anna at once noticed and appreciated , was perfectly suited to her style of beauty .
She was really ingenuous , and a perverted but a sweet and irresponsible woman .
This radiance shone out of her beautiful and really unfathomable eyes .
'Yes , I never thought it would be so exciting , ' replied Anna , blushing .
The company rose to go into the garden .
'I won 't go , ' said Lisa , smiling and sitting down beside Anna . ' You won 't go either ? Who wants to play croquet ? '
It cheers me to look at you .
Why , yours is the gayest set in Petersburg , ' said Anna .
'It may be that those who are not in our set are still more bored , but we - I at any rate - do not feel merry , but terribly , terribly bored . ' 
Sappho lit a cigarette and went out into the garden with the two young men .
Betsy and Stremov stayed at the tea @-@ table .
'Bored ! ' said Betsy . ' Sappho said that they had a very jolly time at your house yesterday . ' 
'I do not do anything , ' said Anna , blushing at these insistent questions .
Lisa Merkalova was his wife 's niece and he spent all his spare time with her .
That is what Anna Arkadyevna says . ' 
'I should have been pleased to have said it , for it is not only wise , but true , ' said Anna , smiling .
'No , but tell me why one cannot fall asleep and cannot help being bored ? '
'To fall asleep one must have worked , and also to amuse oneself one must have worked . ' 
'You are incorrigible , ' said Stremov without looking at her , and again turned to Anna .
Tushkevich came in to say that everybody was waiting for the croquet players .
Stremov joined her in the entreaty .
'The contrast will be too great , ' he remarked , ' if you go to see the old Countess Vrede after leaving this company here .
Besides , your visit will give her an opportunity to backbite , while here , on the contrary , you arouse the best feelings , quite opposed to backbiting . ' 
IN SPITE OF HIS APPARENTLY RECKLESS EXISTENCE , VRONSKY WAS a man who hated disorder .
While quite young and still in the Cadet Corps he had experienced the humiliation of a refusal when , having got into debt , he had tried to borrow money , and since then he had never again allowed himself to get into such a position .
The morning after the races he woke late , and without having a bath or shaving he put on a linen tunic and , spreading out before him his money , his accounts , and his bills and letters , he set to work .
When Petritsky - who knew that on such occasions Vronsky was often cross - on waking saw his friend at his writing @-@ table , he dressed quietly and went out without disturbing him .
And so thought Vronsky .
And not without some inward pride , nor without some justification , he reflected that any other man would long ago have got embroiled and been obliged to act badly if placed in a situation as difficult as his .
But Vronsky felt that it was necessary for him to investigate his affairs just at that time in order to keep out of trouble .
He began by first attacking his money problems , as the easiest to deal with .
Having noted down in his small handwriting on a piece of notepaper all he owed , he made up the account and found that it came to seventeen thousand and a few hundred roubles .
These debts came to about 4000 roubles : 1500 for a horse and 2500 he had incurred by standing security for his young comrade Venevsky , who in Vronsky 's presence had lost that sum to a card @-@ sharper .
Vronsky had wished to pay at the time - he had the money with him - but Venevsky and Yashvin insisted that they would pay , and would not permit Vronsky , who had not even been playing , to do so .
So that for the first part of his debt he must have 4000 roubles ready .
Eight thousand roubles under the second heading were less important : they were owing chiefly for the use of the racecourse stables , to the oats and hay @-@ dealer , to the Englishman , to the saddler and others .
In respect of these debts it was necessary to pay out 2000 roubles , in order to be quite secure .
The remaining debts were owing to shops , hotels , and to his tailor , and there was no need to trouble about them .
So he needed 6000 roubles for immediate use , and had only 1800 roubles ready money .
His father 's immense fortune , which alone brought in 200,000 a year , had not been divided between the brothers .
At that time Alexis told his brother that this would suffice for him till he married , which in all probability he never would do .
And his brother , commanding one of the most expensive regiments , and newly married , could not refuse this gift .
Their mother , who had her own private fortune , allowed Alexis about 20,000 roubles a year in addition to the 25,000 agreed upon , and Alexis spent it all .
Latterly his mother , having quarrelled with him about his connection with Anna and his departure from Moscow , had stopped his allowance .
Consequently Vronsky , who was in the habit of spending 45,000 roubles a year , having this year received only 25,000 , found himself in difficulties .
He could not ask his mother to help him out of them .
His mother 's wish to bribe him offended him to the bottom of his soul and increased his coldness toward her .
It was as impossible as to beat a woman , to steal , or to tell a lie .
Having decided on this , he at once wrote a note to Rolandaki , who had more than once offered to buy his horses .
Then he sent for the money @-@ lender and the Englishman , and allotted what money he had among the different bills .
Having finished this business he wrote a cold and abrupt reply to his mother .
VRONSKY WAS PARTICULARLY FORTUNATE in that he had a code of rules which clearly defined what should and should not be done .
These rules might be irrational and bad but they were absolute , and in complying with them Vronsky felt at ease and could carry his head high .
His present relations to her and her husband were clear and simple to him .
They were very clearly and exactly defined in the code of rules by which he was guided .
She was a respectable woman who had given him her love , and he loved her ; therefore she was for him a woman worthy of as much or even more respect than a legitimate wife .
He would have let his hand be cut off before he would have allowed himself by word or hint to insult her , or fail to show her all the respect that a woman can possibly desire .
His relations toward Society were also clear .
His relations to her husband were simplest of all .
From the moment that Anna gave him her love he considered his own right to her indefeasible .
Her husband was only a superfluous person and a hindrance .
No doubt he was in a pitiable position , but what was to be done ?
The only right the husband had was , weapon in hand , to demand satisfaction , and that Vronsky from the first was prepared to give him .
But latterly new inner relations had sprung up between himself and her , which frightened him by their indefiniteness .
He was taken by surprise , and at the moment when she told him of her condition his heart had suggested his proposal to her to leave her husband .
He had made this proposal , but now , thinking it over , he saw clearly that it would be better to avoid that plan , and yet , while he told himself so , he feared that this might be wrong .
'When I told her to leave her husband , that meant that she should unite herself with me .
Am I ready for that ?
How can I take her away now that I have no money ?
No doubt I could arrange that ... but how could I go away with her while I am in the army ?
Having proposed it , I must be ready to carry it out - that is to say I must find the money and leave the army . ' 
The question of whether to leave or not to leave the army led him to another private matter - almost the chief , though the secret , interest of his life .
Ambition was the old motive of his childhood and youth , one which he did not acknowledge even to himself , but which was so strong a passion that it now struggled against his love .
His first steps in Society and in the service had been successful , but two years ago he had made a bad blunder .
In reality he had begun to feel dissatisfied about the time that he went to Moscow the year before .
'Of course I am not jealous and could not be jealous of Serpukhovskoy , but his promotion shows me that if one bides one 's time the career of such a man as myself may be very quickly made .
Three years ago he and I were in the same position .
By remaining in the service I lose nothing .
She herself said that she did not want to change her position ; and I , having her love , cannot envy Serpukhovskoy . ' 
Everything was clear and distinct , as after his former periodical stocktakings .
He shaved , had a cold bath , dressed , and went out .
'I HAVE COME FOR YOU ; your washing has taken a long time ! ' said Petritsky . ' Well , is it done ? '
Vronsky looked at his comrade without answering , thinking about something else .
'Is that where the music is ? ' he said , listening to the familiar strains , now audible , of brass instruments playing polkas and waltzes . ' What 's up ? '
'Serpukhovskoy has arrived . ' 
'Ah ! I did not know , ' exclaimed Vronsky .
His smiling eyes shone still more brightly .
Serpukhovskoy was a good friend and he was glad that he would see him .
'I am very glad . ' 
Demin the C.O. occupied a large country house , and the whole party were gathered together on the roomy verandah .
After returning to the table , the Commander again came forward with a glass of champagne in his hand and announced a toast : ' To the health of our late comrade , the gallant General , Prince Serpukhovskoy !
Following the Commander , champagne glass in hand , Serpukhovskoy came down smiling .
Vronsky had not seen Serpukhovskoy for three years .
One change Vronsky noticed in him was that quiet and permanent radiance which comes upon the faces of people who have succeeded and feel assured that everybody recognizes their success .
Vronsky knew that kind of radiance , and noticed it at once on Serpukhovskoy 's face .
As he was descending the steps Serpukhovskoy noticed Vronsky .
A smile of joy lit up his face .
He jerked his head backwards and raised his glass , welcoming Vronsky and showing by this gesture that he must first go to the sergeant @-@ major , who was already stretching himself and puckering his lips for a kiss .
'Ah , here he is ! ' exclaimed the Commander , ' and Yashvin told me that you were in one of your dismal moods . ' 
Serpukhovskoy kissed the smart @-@ looking sergeant @-@ major on his moist fresh lips and , wiping his mouth on his handkerchief , stepped up to Vronsky .
'Well , I am glad ! ' he said , taking him apart and pressing his hand .
'You look after him , ' shouted the Commander to Yashvin , and went out to the soldiers .
'Why were you not at the races yesterday ?
I thought I should see you there , ' asked Vronsky , examining Serpukhovskoy .
Excuse me ! ' he added , and turned to his adjutant . ' Please give orders to distribute this money equally among the men . ' 
'Vronsky , will you eat something , or have a drink ? ' said Yashvin . ' Hey !
They drank a great deal .
Then the C.O. danced with Petritsky in front of the singers .
After that , feeling rather weak , he sat down on a bench in the yard and began demonstrating to Yashvin Russia 's superiority to Prussia , especially in cavalry charges , and the carousal quieted down for a moment .
Serpukhovskoy went to the dressing @-@ room to wash his hands , and found Vronsky there .
Vronsky had taken off his coat and was washing his hairy red neck under the washstand tap , rubbing it and his head with his hands .
When he had finished his ablutions Vronsky sat down beside Serpukhovskoy on a little sofa in the dressing @-@ room and began a conversation of great interest to both of them .
'I used to hear all about you from my wife , ' said Serpukhovskoy . ' I am glad you saw a good deal of her . ' 
'She is friends with Varya , and they are the only women in Petersburg whom it is a pleasure for me to meet , ' said Vronsky with a smile .
He smiled because he foresaw the turn their conversation would take and was pleased .
'The only ones ? ' asked Serpukhovskoy , smiling .
'Yes , and I used to hear about you , but not only from your wife , ' said Vronsky , checking the hint by a serious look . ' I am very glad of your success but not at all surprised .
I expected even more . ' 
Serpukhovskoy smiled .
Vronsky 's opinion of him evidently gave him pleasure and he saw no reason to hide it .
'I , on the contrary - I must frankly admit - expected less .
But I am pleased , very pleased ; I am ambitious , it is my weakness , and I acknowledge it . ' 
'Perhaps you would not if you were not successful , ' said Vronsky .
'I do not think so , ' and Serpukhovskoy smiled again . ' I do not mean to say I could not live without it , but it would be a bore .
'It may be so for you , but not for every one .
I used to think the same , yet here I am living and find that it is not worth while living for that alone , ' said Vronsky .
There you are ! ' said Serpukhovskoy , laughing . ' I had begun by saying that I used to hear about you , about your refusal ...
Of course I approved of it .
But there is a way of doing a thing , and I think that , though your action was good in itself , you did not do it in the right way . ' 
'What is done is done , and you know that I never go back on what I have done .
But you will not remain satisfied for long .
I should not say that to your brother .
He is a dear child , just like this host of ours : hear him ! ' he added , listening to the cries of ' Hurrah ! '
'What do you mean ?
'No ; ' said Serpukhovskoy , frowning with vexation at being suspected of such nonsense . ' Tout ça est une blague . ' 
It always has existed and always will .
There are no Communists whatever .
But scheming people always have invented and always will invent some harmful and dangerous Party .
That 's an old trick .
What is wanted is an influential Party of independent men like you and me . ' 
'But why - ' Vronsky named several influential men , ' why are not they independent men ? '
'Only because they have not , or had not by birth , an independent position - had no name , were not born as near the sun as we were .
They can be bought by money or by affability , and must invent a theory to keep their positions .
And they bring forward some idea , some theory ( in which they themselves do not believe and which does harm ) merely as a means of procuring government quarters and a salary .
Maybe I am worse and more foolish than they , though I do not see why I am worse than they .
Anyhow you and I have one great advantage : we cannot be bought so easily .
And such men are more needed than ever . ' 
And , ashamed as he was of the fact , he felt jealous .
'All the same I lack the most necessary thing , ' he replied . ' I lack the wish for power .
'Pardon me , that is not true , ' said Serpukhovskoy with a smile .
'Yes , it is , it is true ... at present to be quite frank , ' added Vronsky .
'Yes , it is true at present - that is another matter , but the present will not last for ever . ' 
'You say " perhaps , " - ' continued Serpukhovskoy as if he had guessed Vronsky 's thoughts ; ' but I say , certainly .
That is why I wanted to see you . You acted rightly : I quite understand it .
But you must not persevere in it .
I only ask you to give me carte blanche .
I am not patronizing you ...
Though why should I not patronize you ?
You have so often patronized me !
I hope our friendship is above that sort of thing !
Yes , ' he said with a smile tender as a woman 's , ' Give me carte blanche , leave the regiment , and I will draw you on imperceptibly . ' 
'But try to understand that I do want nothing except that everything should remain as it is , ' said Vronsky .
'You say , " that all should remain as it is " !
I know what you mean , but hear me !
Vronsky was anxious now to hear the rest of what Serpukhovskoy had to say .
Women are the chief stumbling @-@ block in a man 's career .
It is difficult to love a woman and do anything else .
To achieve it and to love in comfort and unhampered , the only way is to marry !
How am I to put to you what I think ? ' and Serpukhovskoy , who was fond of similes , went on : ' Wait a bit ! Wait a bit ! ...
Yes , if you had to carry a load and use your hands at the same time , it would be possible only if the load were strapped on your back : and that is marriage .
I found that out when I married .
I suddenly had my hands free .
But if you drag that load without marriage , your hands are so full that you can do nothing else .
They have ruined their careers because of women . ' 
'But what women ! ' said Vronsky , recalling the Frenchwoman and the actress with whom these men were entangled .
That is not like merely dragging a load with one 's hands , it is like wrenching it from some one else . ' 
'You have never loved , ' said Vronsky softly , with his eyes looking straight before him and with Anna in his thoughts .
But another point : women are always more materialistic than men .
Men make of love something enormous , but women are always terre @-@ à @-@ terre . [ Matter @-@ of @-@ fact . ]
'Coming , coming ! ' he said , turning to a footman who had entered .
But the footman had not come to call them , as Serpukhovskoy thought .
He brought Vronsky a note .
'Your man brought this from the Princess Tverskaya . ' 
Vronsky opened the note and his face flushed .
'My head has begun aching , ' he said . ' I shall go home . ' 
IT WAS ALREADY PAST FIVE , and in order not to be late and not to use his own horses , which were known to everybody , Vronsky took Yashvin 's hired carriage and told the coachman to drive as fast as possible .
This feeling was so strong that he could not help smiling .
'Delightful ! O delightful ! ' he thought .
He had often before been joyfully conscious of his body , but had never loved himself , his own body , as he did now .
It gave him pleasure to feel the slight pain in his strong leg , to be conscious of the muscles of his chest moving as he breathed .
That clear , cool August day which made Anna feel so hopeless seemed exhilarating and invigorating to him and refreshed his face and neck , which were glowing after their washing and rubbing .
The scent of brilliantine given off by his moustache seemed peculiarly pleasant in the fresh air .
The coachman felt something in his hand , the whip cracked , and the carriage rolled quickly along the smooth macadamized high road .
Where ?
Why has she given me an appointment here , in a letter from Betsy ? ' he thought ; but there was no longer any time for thinking .
Before reaching the avenue he ordered the coachman to stop , opened the carriage door , jumped out while the carriage was still moving , and went up the avenue leading to the house .
There was no one in the avenue , but turning to the right he saw her .
On reaching him she clasped his hand firmly .
'You are not angry that I told you to come ?
It was absolutely necessary for me to see you , ' she said ; and at sight of the serious and severe expression of her mouth under her veil his mood changed at once .
But how did you get here ? '
'Never mind ! ' she said , putting her hand on his arm . ' Come , I must speak to you . ' 
He felt that something had happened , and that this interview would not be a happy one .
In her presence he had no will of his own : without knowing the cause of her agitation he became infected by it .
'What is it ? What ? ' he asked , pressing her hand against his side with his elbow and trying to read her face .
She took a few steps in silence to gather courage , and then suddenly stopped .
'I did not tell you last night , ' she began , breathing quickly and heavily , ' that on my way back with Alexis Alexandrovich I told him everything ... said I could not be his wife , and ... I told him all . ' 
He listened , involuntarily leaning forward with his whole body as if trying so to ease her burden .
'Yes , yes , that is better ! A thousand times better !
After reading her husband 's letter she knew in the depths of her heart that all would remain as it was , that she would not have the courage to disregard her position and give up her son in order to be united with her lover .
The afternoon spent at the Princess Tverskaya 's house had confirmed that thought .
Yet this interview was still of extreme importance to her .
She hoped that the meeting might bring about a change in her position and save her .
If at this news he would firmly , passionately , and without a moment 's hesitation say to her : ' Give up everything and fly with me ! ' she would abandon her son and go with him .
But the news had not the effect on him that she had desired : he only looked as if he had been offended by something .
'It was not at all hard for me - it all came about of itself , ' she said , irritably . ' And here ... ' she pulled her husband 's note from under her glove .
'Why do you tell me this ? ' she said . ' Do you think I could doubt it ?
If I doubted it ... '
'Who 's that coming ? ' said Vronsky , pointing to two ladies who were coming toward them . ' They may know us ! ' and he moved quickly in the direction of a sidewalk , drawing her along with him .
After he had read the letter he looked up at her , but his look was not firm .
She understood at once that he had already considered this by himself , knew that whatever he might say he would not tell her all that he was thinking , and knew that her last hopes had been deceived .
'You see what a man he is ! ' she said in a trembling voice . ' He ... '
'Why impossible ? ' said Anna , forcing back her tears and clearly no longer attaching any importance to what he would say .
She felt that her fate was decided .
Vronsky wanted to say that after what he considered to be the inevitable duel it could not continue ; but he said something else .
'It cannot continue .
I hope that you will now leave him .
I hope ... ' he became confused and blushed ' that you will allow me to arrange and to think out a life for ourselves . To @-@ morrow ... '
'And my son ? ' she exclaimed . ' You see what he writes ? I must leave him , and I cannot do that and do not want to . ' 
'Degrading for whom ? '
'For everybody , and especially for you . ' 
'You call it degrading ! do not call it that ; such words have no meaning for me , ' she replied tremulously .
She did not wish him to tell untruths now .
She had only his love left , and she wanted to love him . ' Try to understand that since I loved you everything has changed for me .
There is only one single thing in the world for me : your love !
If I have it , I feel so high and firm that nothing can be degrading for me .
Tears of shame and despair choked her . She stopped and burst into sobs .
He also felt something rising in his throat , and for the first time in his life he felt ready to cry .
She silently shook her head . ' Would it not be possible to take your son away with you and go away all the same ? '
Now I go back to him , ' she said dryly .
'On Tuesday I shall go back to Petersburg and everything will be decided . ' 
'Yes , ' she said , ' but don 't let us talk about it . ' 
Anna 's carriage , which she had sent away and ordered to return to the gate of the Vrede Garden , drove up .
Anna took leave of Vronsky and went home .
Karenin entered the Council room , greeted the members and the president as usual , and took his seat , his hand lying ready on the paper before him .
Among these papers were the statistics that he needed and a draft of the statement he was going to make .
But he did not really require the figures .
He remembered them all and did not even consider it necessary to go over in his mind what he was going to say .
He felt that the contents of his speech would be so important that every word would be significant .
Yet as he listened to the general reports his face wore a most innocent and artless look .
When he came to the Fundamental and Organic Law his opponent jumped up and began to raise objections .
Karenin 's success was even greater than he had expected .
Busy with the secretary , Karenin quite forgot that it was Tuesday , the day fixed for Anna 's return , and was surprised and unpleasantly startled when the footman came in to inform him of her arrival .
Anna returned to Petersburg early in the morning , and as she had wired that the carriage should be sent for her he might have expected her .
She sent word to her husband that she had arrived and went to her boudoir , where she set to work sorting her things , expecting that he would come in to see her .
She knew that according to his habits he would soon go away to his work and she wished to see him first .
She passed through the ballroom to his study and resolutely went in .
When she entered he was sitting in his official uniform evidently ready to start , with his elbows on a little table , looking wearily in front of him .
He came up , took her hand , and asked her to sit down .
'I am very glad you have come , ' he said , sitting down beside her . He evidently wished to say something , but faltered .
Several times he tried to speak , but stopped .
Although while preparing for this interview she had been teaching herself to despise and blame him , she did not know what to say , and pitied him .
There was silence for some time . ' Is Serezha well ? ' he asked ; and without waiting for a reply he added , ' I am not dining at home to @-@ day and must be going at once . ' 
'I meant to go away to Moscow , ' she said .
'Oh no , you were quite right to come , ' he replied , and again became silent .
Seeing that he had not the strength to begin , she began for him .
'But our relations cannot be what they were before , ' Anna began in a timid voice , looking at him with frightened eyes .
'I cannot be your wife , since I ... ' she began .
He laughed in a cruel , cold manner .
'I suppose the kind of life you have chosen has affected your principles .
I respect or despise both so much - I respect your past and despise your present that the interpretation you give to my words was far from my thoughts ! '
Anna sighed and hung her head .
'Alexis Alexandrovich , what do you want of me ? '
'What I want , is not to meet that person here , and for you to behave in such a way that neither Society nor the servants shall be able to accuse you , - for you not to see that man .
I think that is not much to ask !
And in return you will enjoy all the advantages of a wife without fulfilling her duties .
He stopped and let her pass first .
Why did Darya Alexandrovna tell me this ? I might have met her accidentally and then all would have come naturally , but now it is impossible ! '
'I have been told , ' she wrote , ' that you have a side @-@ saddle . I hope you will bring it yourself . ' 
That was more than he could stand .
'How can an intelligent woman with any delicacy so humiliate a sister ? '
He wrote ten notes and tore them all up , sending the saddle at last without any reply .
To say that he would come was impossible , because he could not come ; to say that something prevented him from coming , or that he was leaving home , was still worse .
But now he was glad to go away from the proximity of Kitty and from his farm , and especially to go shooting , an occupation which served him as the best solace in all his troubles .
THERE WAS NO RAILWAY or stage @-@ coach to the Surovsky district , and Levin went in his own tarantas .
A cleanly @-@ dressed young woman with goloshes on her stockingless feet was washing the floor in the passage .
The dog that followed Levin frightened her , but when she was told that it would not hurt her she at once began to laugh at her own alarm .
After pointing to the door with her bare arm she again stooped , hiding her handsome face , and went on scrubbing .
'Yes , please . ' 
By the door stood a little cupboard with crockery .
'Look alive ! ' the old man called merrily after her , and approached Levin . ' Is it to Nicholas Ivanich Sviyazhsky you are going , sir ?
He too stops at our place , ' he began garrulously , leaning on the banisters of the porch .
In the midst of his conversation about his acquaintanceship with Sviyazhsky the gates creaked again , and the labourers returning from the fields came into the yard with their ploughs and harrows .
The horses harnessed to the ploughs and harrows were big and well @-@ fed .
Don 't let the gelding out , Fedot , lead him to the trough . We 'll harness another . ' 
'I say , father ! have those ploughshares I ordered been brought ? ' asked a tall , robust young fellow , evidently the old man 's son .
'There in the passage , ' answered the old man , winding the reins into a ring and throwing them on the ground . ' Fix them on before we finish dinner . ' 
Other women , young and handsome , middle @-@ aged , old and plain , some with children , others without , appeared from somewhere .
Levin took his provisions out of the tarantas and invited the old man to have tea with him .
'Why , I don 't know ! We have had tea once to @-@ day , ' said he , evidently pleased to accept the invitation . ' Well , just for company ! '
Ten years previously he had rented about four hundred acres from the landowner , and the year before he had bought them outright and rented another nine hundred from a neighbouring proprietor .
A small part of the land - the worst - he let , and with the aid of his family and two hired men cultivated about a hundred and twenty acres .
But Levin knew that he only did so for propriety 's sake and that in reality his farm was flourishing .
Had his affairs been in a bad way he would not have bought land at thirty @-@ five roubles an acre , would not have married three of his sons and a nephew , and would not have twice rebuilt his homestead after fires , nor rebuilt it better each time .
From their conversation Levin gathered that he was not against new methods either .
He had planted many potatoes which had already flowered and were forming fruit , as Levin had noticed when passing the fields on the way , while Levin 's own potatoes were just beginning to flower .
He ploughed the land for the potatoes with an English plough , which he had borrowed from a landowner .
He also sowed wheat .
Levin was struck especially by one little detail . The old peasant used the thinnings of the rye as fodder for the horses .
Many a time when Levin had seen this valuable food wasted he had wanted to have it gathered up , but had found this impossible .
'There now ! We landlords don 't get on well because of the labourers , ' said Levin , handing him a tumbler of tea .
Take Sviyazhsky now .
'And yet you too use hired labour on your farm ? '
We can manage for ourselves . ' 
'Father , Finnigan wants some tar fetched , ' said the woman with the goloshes , coming in .
'That 's how it is , sir , ' said the old man , rising ; and after crossing himself several times he thanked Levin and went out .
When Levin went into the back room to call his coachman he found the whole peasant family at dinner .
The women served standing .
The vigorous young son with his mouth full of buckwheat porridge was saying something funny , and everybody laughed heartily - the woman with the goloshes laughing more merrily than anyone as she refilled the bowl with cabbage soup .
And all the rest of the way to Sviyazhsky 's he every now and then recalled that household , as if the impression it had left on him demanded special attention .
SVIYAZHSKY WAS MARSHAL OF THE NOBILITY in his district .
He was five years older than Levin and had long been married .
His young sister @-@ in @-@ law , whom Levin thought very pleasant , lived with them .
He knew that both Sviyazhsky and his wife wanted to see her married to him , Levin .
And this knowledge spoilt the pleasure which he hoped his visit to Sviyazhsky would give him .
Sviyazhsky 's home life was extremely pleasant , and Sviyazhsky himself was the best type of social worker that Levin had ever known , and Levin always found him very interesting .
Sviyazhsky was an extreme Liberal .
But he could not call him a fool because Sviyazhsky was not only very intelligent but also a very well @-@ educated man , who carried his education with extreme modesty .
There was no subject with which he was not acquainted , but he only exhibited his knowledge when forced to do so .
Levin tried but could not understand him , and regarded him and his life as animated riddles .
The Sviyazhskys were friendly with Levin , and therefore he allowed himself to sound Sviyazhsky and try to get to the very foundation of his philosophy of life , but it was all in vain .
Now , after his disillusion with the work on his estate , Levin was especially pleased to stay a while with Sviyazhsky .
'These matters might not have been so important in the time of serfdom and may be unimportant in England .
The shooting did not prove as good as he had expected .
The marsh had dried up and there were hardly any snipe .
In the evening at tea a very interesting conversation sprang up , just as Levin had expected , in the company of two landlords who had come about some guardianship business .
Levin sat beside the hostess at the tea table , and was obliged to converse with her and her sister , who was sitting opposite him .
The hostess was a short , fair , round @-@ faced woman , beaming with smiles and dimples .
Levin tried to find out through her the answer to the riddle , so important to him , presented by her husband ; but he had not full freedom of thought because he felt painfully uncomfortable .
Levin felt as if he were deceiving some one , as if he ought to offer some explanation which was impossible , and therefore he kept blushing and was restless and uncomfortable .
His discomfort communicated itself to the pretty sister , but the hostess did not seem to notice anything and purposely drew her sister into the conversation .
'You say , ' the hostess continued , ' that my husband cannot feel an interest in anything Russian ?
On the contrary , though he is happy abroad , he is never so happy there as here .
He feels in his own sphere .
Oh ! you have not been to see our school ! '
'I saw it ...
'Yes , that is Nastya 's business , ' she said , pointing to her sister .
'You yourself teach ? ' asked Levin , trying to look beyond the bodice , but conscious that if he looked in her direction he must see it .
'Yes , I have been and am still teaching , but we have a splendid master .
He looked with his glittering black eyes straight at an excited landowner , with a grey moustache , whose words evidently amused him .
This landowner with the grey moustache was evidently an inveterate believer in serfdom , and a passionate farmer who had lived long in the country .
'But we see you don 't give it up , ' said Nicholas Ivanich Sviyazhsky , ' so it seems it has its advantages . ' 
You would hardly believe what drunkenness and debauchery there is !
They are starving , yet if you hire one of them as a labourer , he 'll spoil and break things , and will even lodge complaints with the magistrate . ' 
'On the other hand you , too , complain to the magistrate . ' 
'I complain ? Never !
It would cause such gossip that one would be sorry one tried it .
And what did the magistrate do ?
He thrashes them in the old style .
The landowner evidently meant to tease Sviyazhsky , but the latter did not take offence ; on the contrary , he evidently enjoyed it .
'Well , you see , we carry on our work without such measures , I and Levin and he , ' Sviyazhsky said smiling , and pointing to the other landowner .
'My farming is very simple , thank heaven ! ' said Michael Petrovich .
'My farming is to have money ready for the autumn taxes .
But it is true there are some dishonest ones among them . ' 
Levin , who had long been acquainted with these patriarchal methods , exchanged a glance with Sviyazhsky , and , interrupting Michael Petrovich , addressed the landowner with the grey moustache .
'How then , in your opinion , should one carry on at present ? '
'Why , carry on the way Michael Petrovich does : either pay the peasants in kind , or rent it to them ! That is quite possible , but the wealth of the community as a whole is ruined by such methods .
Where my land used to yield ninefold under serfdom with good management , it only now yields threefold when the labourers are paid in kind .
Sviyazhsky looked at Levin with smiling eyes , and even made a just perceptible sarcastic sign to him ridiculing the old man , but Levin did not consider the landowner 's words ridiculous , he understood him better than he did Sviyazhsky .
Much of what the landowner said subsequently , to prove that Russia was ruined by the Emancipation , even appeared to him to be very true , new , and undeniable .
Take European history .
They must have been introduced at the time of the Rurik Princes , and doubtless by force .
Now that serfdom has been abolished and the power taken out of our hands , our agriculture where it has been brought to a high level must descend to a savage and primitive condition .
If your farming is rational you can carry it on with hired labour , ' said Sviyazhsky .
By means of whose labour am I to carry it on ? '
'Here we have it ! The labour @-@ power is the chief element of agriculture , ' thought Levin .
'Hired labourers don 't want to work well with good tools .
Our labourers understand one thing only : to get drunk like swine , and when drunk to spoil everything you put into their hands .
They hate to see anything that is beyond them .
That is why the level of agriculture has gone down .
And he began to develop his plan of emancipation , which might have prevented this dislocation .
'The fact that our agriculture is sinking , that it is impossible , our relation to the peasants being what it is , to carry on our rational farming profitably , is quite true . ' 
We have no machines , no good horses , no proper management , and we do not know how to keep accounts .
Ask any farmer ; he cannot tell you what is profitable for you and what is not . ' 
'Italian bookkeeping ! ' said the landowner scornfully . ' Keep your accounts as you will - if they spoil everything you have got , you won 't have a profit ! '
'Why spoil everything ?
They will break your inferior Russian threshers , but they cannot break my steam threshing @-@ machine .
'Yes ; if one can afford it , Nicholas Ivanich !
No , thank you ! '
'I do not believe that it is either advisable or possible to raise the level of agriculture , ' said Levin . ' I go in for it , and have means , but I never could do anything .
I at any rate never spent money on improvements without loss . Expensive cattle bring me a loss , and machinery too . ' 
'Yes , that is quite true , ' said the landowner with the grey moustache , and he even laughed with pleasure .
'And I am not the only one , ' continued Levin . ' I can refer you to many farmers who carry on rational farming , and with rare exceptions they all make a loss on it .
Besides , this question was not quite honest .
She did not remember the exact figure , though the German had calculated it down to a quarter of a kopeck .
The landowner smiled when the profits of Sviyazhsky 's farming were mentioned , evidently aware of the sort of profits that his neighbour the Marshal of the Nobility was able to make .
'It may be unprofitable , ' answered Sviyazhsky , ' but that only shows that I am either a bad farmer or that I spend capital to raise the rent . ' 
But you had better tell us how the theory of rent can be ... '
Mary , send us some curds and whey or some raspberries here , ' said Sviyazhsky to his wife .
'This year the raspberries are lasting an extraordinarily long time , ' and Sviyazhsky got up cheerfully and moved away , evidently regarding the conversation as finished at the very point where to Levin it seemed to be just beginning .
'Why do you think , ' asked Levin , trying to bring him back to the question , ' that we could not establish some relation with labour which would make it remunerative ? '
'It will never be done with Russians !
The labourer , the hired man , the farmer , you cannot get away from them . ' 
'All I wish to say is , ' said Levin , ' why should we not seek them for ourselves ? '
'Because it would be just the same as inventing new methods of building a railway .
'But if they don 't suit us ? If they are stupid ? ' said Levin .
And again he noticed a look of fear in the eyes of Sviyazhsky .
'Oh yes , it is all child 's play for us : we have discovered what Europe is looking for !
I know all that , but excuse me , do you know what has been accomplished in Europe with regard to the labour question ? '
'The question is at present occupying the best brains in Europe .
Then there is a whole gigantic literature on the labour question , with the most Liberal Lassalle tendency ...
The Mulhausen system - that is already a fact . I expect you know about it . ' 
'I have some idea about it , but very vague . ' 
'Oh , you only say so , I am sure you know about it just as well as I do !
I am , of course , not a professor of Sociology , but it interests me , and really if it interests you , you had better study the matter . ' 
'Excuse me ... '
The landowners had risen , and Sviyazhsky , having again checked Levin in his disagreeable habit of prying beyond the reception rooms of his mind , went to see his visitors off .
And he felt that it could be solved , and that he must try to do it .
Beside the writing @-@ table was a stand with gold @-@ labelled drawers containing various business papers .
'What is it you are looking at ? ' he asked Levin , who , having stopped at the round table , was looking at one of the journals .
And with characteristic clearness he briefly recounted these new and very important and interesting discoveries .
Though at present Levin was more interested in agriculture than in anything else , he asked himself while listening to his host , ' What is there inside him ?
And why , why does the Partition of Poland interest him ? '
And when Sviyazhsky had finished he could not help asking him , ' Well , and what of it ? '
But Sviyazhsky had no answer to give .
It was interesting that ' it turns out , ' and he did not consider it necessary to explain why it interested him .
'Yes , and I was greatly interested by that cross old landowner , ' said Levin with a sigh . ' He is intelligent and said much that is true . ' 
He is secretly a rooted partisan of serfdom like all of them ! ' said Sviyazhsky .
'Whose Marshal you are ... '
'Yes , but I marshal them in the opposite direction , ' said Sviyazhsky , laughing .
Whose fault is it ? '
'Our own , of course ! but it is not true that it does not pay .
The people are on so low a level both of material and moral development that they are certain to oppose what is good for them .
In Europe rational farming answers because the people are educated ; therefore we must educate our people - that 's all . ' 
'But how is one to educate them ? '
'To educate the people three things are necessary : schools , schools , schools ! '
'But you yourself just said that the people are on a low level of material development : how will schools help that ? '
'But how will schools help ? '
'By giving people other wants . ' 
'Now that I never could understand , ' replied Levin , hotly . ' How will schools help the peasants to improve their material conditions ?
You say that schools and education will give them new wants .
So much the worse , for they won 't be able to satisfy them .
And in what way knowing how to add and subtract and to say the catechism will help them to improve their material condition , I never could understand !
The other evening I met a woman with an infant in her arms and asked her where she was going .
She replied that she had been to see the " wise woman " because her boy was fractious , and she took him to be cured .
I asked her what cure the wise woman had for fractiousness .
" She puts the baby on the perch among the fowls and says something . " -'
'Well , there is your answer !
Education will stop them from carrying their children to the roosts to cure them of fractiousness , ' said Sviyazhsky with a merry smile .
'Oh , not at all ! ' said Levin , crossly . ' That treatment seems to me just a parallel to treating the peasants by means of schools .
The people are poor and ignorant , this we know as surely as the woman knows that the child is fractious because it cries .
But why schools should cure the ills of poverty and ignorance is just as incomprehensible as why hens on their perches should cure fractiousness .
What needs to be cured is their poverty . ' 
'Well , I am very glad , or rather very sorry , that I coincide with Spencer ; but it is a thing I have long known .
Schools are no remedy , but the remedy would be an economic organization under which the people would be better off and have more leisure . Then schools would come . ' 
'Yet all over Europe education is now compulsory . ' 
'And how do you agree with Spencer yourself in this matter ? '
A frightened look flashed up in Sviyazhsky 's eyes and he said with a smile :
Levin saw that he would not succeed in finding a connection between this man 's life and his thoughts .
It was evidently all the same to him what conclusions his reasoning led to : he only needed the process itself , and he did not like it when the process of reasoning led him up a blind alley .
That he disliked and evaded by turning the conversation to something pleasantly jocular .
All the impressions of that day , beginning with the impression of the peasant at the halfway @-@ house which seemed to serve as a foundation for all the other impressions and ideas , agitated Levin greatly .
Left alone in the room assigned to him , and lying on a spring mattress which bounced unexpectedly whenever he moved a leg or an arm , it was long before Levin could sleep .
Not one of the talks he had had with Sviyazhsky , though much that was clever had been said by the latter , interested him , but the landowner 's arguments required consideration .
Levin involuntarily remembered all that the man had said , and corrected in imagination the answers he himself had given .
Your and our common dissatisfaction with farming shows that we , and not the peasants , are at fault .
We have long pushed on in our own way - the European way - without considering the nature of the labour force available .
Let us consider the labourer not as an abstract labour force but as a Russian peasant with his own instincts , and let us arrange our farming accordingly .
Divide equally and give half the produce to labour , and the share left for you will be larger , and the labour force will receive more .
And to do this we must lower the level of cultivation and give the peasants an interest in its success .
How this can be done is a question of details , but it is certainly possible . " -'
This thought strongly excited Levin .
He lay awake half the night considering the details necessary for carrying his thought into effect .
He had not meant to leave next day , but now decided to go away early in the morning .
One of the chief difficulties was that the farming was actually going on and it was impossible to stop it all and start afresh ; so that the machine had to be altered while it was working .
He remarked that he had always said so but had not been listened to .
Another stumbling @-@ block was the peasant 's invincible mistrust of the possibility of a landlord having any other aim than that of robbing them as much as possible .
They were firmly convinced that his real aim ( whatever he might say ) would always be hidden in what he did not tell them .
And they themselves , when they talked , said much , but never said what they really wanted .
Yet in spite of all these difficulties he got his way , and by autumn the scheme began to work , or at any rate it seemed so to him .
The cattle @-@ yard , the fruit and vegetable gardens , the meadows and the corn @-@ fields , divided into several parts , should come under different sections .
The rest remained as before ; but these three sections were the beginning of a new order and fully occupied Levin .
It was true that Theodore Rezunw 's group did not plough the corn land twice with the English plough as they had agreed to do , pleading lack of time .
It was true that Shuraev had taken steps to sublet the kitchen garden in small lots to the other peasants ; he evidently quite misunderstood , and apparently intentionally misunderstood , the conditions on which the land was let to him .
These affairs added to the rest of the farming which remained on his hands , and the indoor work on his book , so filled Levin 's whole summer that he hardly ever made time to go out shooting .
At the end of August he heard from a servant who brought back the side @-@ saddle that the Oblonskys had gone back to Moscow .
He felt that by not having answered Dolly Oblonskaya 's letter ( a rudeness he could not remember without blushing ) he had burned his boats and could never visit there again .
He had treated the Sviyazhskys just as badly , having left their house without saying good @-@ bye .
That made no difference to him now .
The rearrangement of his farming interested him more than anything had ever done in his life .
Political economy maintained that the laws by which the wealth of Europe had developed and is developing are universal and unquestionable laws .
The socialistic teaching declared that development on those lines leads to ruin .
Often , just as he was beginning to understand the idea in his interlocutor 's mind and to explain his own , he would suddenly be asked : And what about Kauffmann and Jones , and Dubois and Michelli ? '
Have you not read them ?
He now clearly saw that Kauffmann and Michelli had nothing to tell him .
This he wanted to prove theoretically in his book and practically by his farming .
Everything on the estate was going well practically , at least Levin thought so .
But rain set in , making it impossible to get in what remained of the corn and potatoes , stopped all the work , and even prevented the delivery of the wheat .
The mud made the roads impassable : two mills had been carried away by floods , and the weather was getting worse and worse .
On the thirtieth of September the sun showed itself in the morning , and , in hopes of fine weather , Levin began seriously preparing for his departure .
Notwithstanding the gloomy aspect of nature around him he felt peculiarly elated .
His conversation with the peasants of the outlying village showed that they were beginning to get used to the new conditions .
An old inn @-@ keeper , into whose house he had gone to dry himself , evidently approved of Levin 's plan and had offered to join a group to buy cattle .
'I need only push on steadily toward my aim and I shall achieve it , ' he thought , ' and it is worth working and striving for .
It is not a personal affair of my own but one of public welfare .
The whole system of farming , and above all the position of the people , must be completely altered : instead of poverty - wealth and satisfaction for all ; instead of hostility - concord and a bond of common interest .
In a word - a revolution bloodless but immense ; first in our own small district , then throughout the province , throughout Russia , and the whole world - for a good thought must be fruitful .
Yes it is an aim worth working for !
I feel sure that Franklin felt just as insignificant and distrusted himself just as I do when he remembered his past .
He too probably had an Agatha Mikhaylovna to whom he confided his secrets . ' 
With such thoughts Levin reached home when it was already dark .
The steward , having been to the merchant , had returned bringing an instalment of the money for the wheat .
Having dined , Levin as usual sat down in his easy @-@ chair with a book , and while reading continued to think about his impending journey in connection with the book he was writing .
To @-@ day the importance of his work presented itself to him with especial clearness , and whole paragraphs of their own accord shaped themselves in his mind , expressing the gist of his thoughts .
'I must write that , down , ' thought he . ' That must form a short preface , such as I formerly considered unnecessary . ' 
He rose to go to his writing @-@ table , and Laska , who was lying at his feet , stretched herself , also got up , and looked round at him as if asking where she was to go to .
But he had no time to write his thoughts down , for the labourers ' foremen had come , and Levin went into the hall to speak to them .
After arranging about the next day 's work by seeing the peasants who had come on business , Levin went to his study and sat down to his work .
Laska lay down under the table , and Agatha Mikhaylovna with her knitting sat down in her usual place .
Having written for some time , Levin suddenly with particular vividness remembered Kitty , her refusal , and their last meeting .
He rose and began to pace up and down the room .
'What is the use of fretting ? ' said Agatha Mikhaylovna . ' Why do you always sit at home ?
Have you not done enough for the peasants as it is !
'I am not bothering about them : I am doing it for myself . ' 
He often laid bare his thoughts before her in all their details , and frequently argued with her and disagreed with her explanations .
But this time she quite misunderstood what he said .
'I am not speaking about that , ' he said . ' I mean that I am doing it for my own profit .
My gains are bigger when the peasants work better . ' 
If he has a conscience he will work , if not , you can do nothing with him . ' 
'But you yourself say that Ivan looks after the cattle better now . ' 
'I only say , ' answered Agatha Mikhaylovna , evidently not speaking at random but with strict sequence of thought , ' you must marry , that is all ! '
Her mention of the very thing he was just thinking about grieved and hurt him .
He frowned , and without replying again sat down to his work , repeating to himself all that he had been thinking about its importance .
Only occasionally , in the stillness , he listened to the clicking of her needles and , remembering what he did not wish to remember , made a wry face .
'There now ! Visitors have come to you , ' said Agatha Mikhaylovna , rising and going toward the door .
But Levin overtook her . His work was not getting on now and he was glad of a visitor , whoever it might be .
Levin was fond of his brother , but to be with him was always a torment .
Under the sway of the thoughts that had come to him and of Agatha Mikhaylovna 's reminders , he was in an unsettled and confused state of mind and the forthcoming meeting with his brother seemed particularly distressing .
And that was what he did not desire .
Angry with himself for this bad feeling Levin ran into the hall ; and as soon as he had a near view of his brother this feeling of disappointment vanished and was replaced by pity .
Dreadful as his emaciation and illness had previously made Nicholas , he was now still thinner and weaker .
He was a mere skeleton covered with skin .
He stood in the hall jerking his long , thin neck , drawing a scarf from it , and smiling in a strangely piteous manner .
When he saw this meek , submissive smile , Levin felt his throat contract convulsively .
'There ! I have come to see you , ' said Nicholas in a hollow voice , without taking his eyes for an instant from his brother 's face .
He was still more terrified when , kissing his brother 's face , his lips felt the dryness of the skin and he saw his large strangely brilliant eyes close at hand .
Nicholas said that he had now come to fetch that money , but chiefly to visit his own nest and touch his native soil , in order like the heroes of old to gather strength from it for the work that lay before him .
In spite of the fact that he was more round @-@ shouldered than ever and that , being so tall , his leanness was startling , his movements were quick and sudden as formerly .
Levin took him to his room .
Nicholas dressed carefully , a thing he never used to do , brushed his thin , straight hair and went smiling upstairs .
He was in a most affectionate and cheerful mood , such as Levin remembered his often being in as a child : and he even mentioned Sergius Ivanich without irritation .
When he met Agatha Mikhaylovna he joked with her and questioned her about the other old servants : The news of Parfen Denisich 's death affected him strangely .
A look of fear appeared on his face but he immediately recovered himself .
'After all , he was old , ' he remarked and changed the subject . ' Well , I will spend a month or two with you and then I will go to Moscow .
D 'you know , Myagkov has promised me a post and I am entering the Civil Service .
I will now arrange my life quite differently , ' he continued . ' You know , I have got rid of that woman ? '
She has caused me a lot of unpleasantness , ' but he did not say in what the unpleasantness consisted .
Of course , like everybody else , I have done stupid things , but property is the least consideration and I don 't regret mine .
Health is the great thing , and my health , thank God , has improved . ' 
Levin listened , trying but unable to think of what to say .
Nicholas probably felt the same ; he began questioning his brother about his affairs , and Levin was glad to talk about himself because he could do so without any pretence : He told Nicholas of his plans and activities .
Nicholas listened but evidently was not interested .
These two men were so near akin and so intimate with one another , that between them the least movement or intonation expressed more than could be said in words .
At present the same thought filled both their minds and dominated all else : Nicholas 's illness and approaching death .
But neither of them dared speak of it , and not having expressed the one thing that occupied their thoughts , whatever they said rang false .
Never before had Levin felt so glad when an evening was over and it was time to go to bed .
Never had he been so unnatural and artificial , even with an outsider or when making a formal call , as he was that day .
And his consciousness of this artificiality and his repentance made him more unnatural .
He wished to weep over his dear , dying brother , but had to listen and keep up a conversation about how Nicholas was going to live .
The house being damp , and only his bedroom heated , Levin put his brother to sleep behind a partition in that room .
Nicholas went to bed but , whether he slept or not , kept tossing and coughing like a sick man and , when unable to clear his throat , muttering some complaint .
Sometimes he sighed deeply and said , ' Oh , my God ! '
Sometimes , when the phlegm choked him , he muttered angrily , ' Oh , the devil ! '
Levin long lay awake listening to him .
His thoughts were very various , but they all led up to death .
Death , the inevitable end of everything , confronted him for the first time with irresistible force .
And that Death which was present in this dear brother ( who , waking up , moaned and by habit called indiscriminately on God and on the devil ) was not so far away as it had hitherto seemed to be .
It was within himself too he felt it .
If not to @-@ day , then to @-@ morrow or thirty years hence , was it not all the same ?
But what that inevitable Death was , he not only did not know , not only had never considered , but could not and dared not consider .
'I am working , I want to do something , and I had forgotten that it will all end in Death ! '
He sat on his bed in the dark , doubled his arms round his knees and thought , scarcely breathing from the mental strain .
He lit a candle , got up carefully , went to the looking @-@ glass , and began examining his face and hair .
Yes ! There were grey hairs on his temples .
He bared his muscular arms .
Yes , he was very strong .
'And now that sunk and hollow chest ... And I , who do not know what will happen to me , or why ... '
Why don 't you sleep ? ' his brother 's voice called to him .
'Oh , I don 't know , just sleeplessness . ' 
'And I have slept well ; I don 't perspire now .
See , feel my shirt , it 's not damp ! '
Levin felt it , returned behind the partition , and put out the candle , but was long unable to sleep .
Just when the question of how to live had become a little clearer to him , a new insoluble problem presented itself - Death .
'Well , he is dying , he will die before spring . How can he be helped ?
What can I say to him ?
What do I know about it ?
I had forgotten there was such a thing ! '
LEVIN HAD LONG AGO NOTICED that after people have made one uncomfortable by their pliancy and submissiveness they soon become unbearably exacting and aggressive .
He felt that this would happen with his brother .
And really Nicholas 's meekness did not last long .
The very next morning he grew irritable and cavilled at everything his brother said , touching his most sensitive spots .
Levin felt guilty but could do nothing .
That was all they would say if only they spoke straight from the heart .
On the third day of his stay Nicholas challenged his brother to explain his plans to him once more , and not only found fault with them but purposely confused them with communism .
'But I tell you that the two things have nothing in common !
'But my idea has nothing in common ... '
'That idea , ' said Nicholas Levin with a sarcastic smile and angrily glistening eyes , ' that idea at any rate , if one may say so , has a geometric charm of definiteness and certainty .
It may be utopian ; but granting the possibility of making a tabula rasa of the past - and abolishing private property and families - then labour comes by its own . But you have nothing ... '
'Why do you muddle it ? I never was a communist . ' 
'But I have been , and now I think it is premature but reasonable , and that it has a future as Christianity had in the first centuries . ' 
'I only think that the force of labour must be dealt with in a scientifically experimental manner . It must be studied and its characteristics ... '
'But that is quite unnecessary !
That force finds its own form of activity in accord with its degree of development .
There used to be slaves everywhere , then villeins ; and we have labour paid in kind , and leaseholders , and hired labour : so what are you looking for ? '
At these words Levin suddenly grew warm , for at the bottom of his heart he felt that it was true - true that he wished to balance between communism and the existing forms of life , and that this was hardly possible .
'I want to establish ... '
'You do not want to establish anything . You simply want to be original , as you always have done , and to show that you are not just exploiting the peasants , but have ideas ! '
'You think so ? Well , then , leave me alone ! ' said Levin , and he felt that a muscle was uncontrollably quivering in his left cheek .
'You have no convictions and never had any ; you only want to flatter your self @-@ esteem . ' 
'Well , all right ! But leave me alone . ' 
You can go to the devil !
And I am sorry I came ! '
However much Levin tried afterwards to pacify his brother , Nicholas would not listen to it , but said that it was much better for them to part . And Levin saw that life had become simply intolerable for his brother .
Nicholas had quite made up his mind to go . Constantine came to him again and in an unnatural manner asked his forgiveness if he had offended him in any way .
'Ah , this is magnanimity ! ' said Nicholas , and smiled . ' If you wish to be in the right , I can let you have that pleasure .
Only just before he left Nicholas kissed Constantine , and suddenly said with a strange and serious look at his brother ,
'Do not think too badly of me , Kostya ! ' and his voice trembled .
These were the only sincere words that had passed between them .
Levin understood that they were meant to say , ' You see that I am in a bad way , and perhaps we shall not meet again . ' 
He understood this , and tears trembled in his eyes .
He again kissed his brother , but he did not know what to answer .
Three days after his brother 's departure Levin left for abroad .
He surprised young Shcherbatsky , Kitty 's cousin , whom he happened to meet at a railway station , by his moroseness .
'What is the matter with you ? ' asked Shcherbatsky .
'Little ? You 'd better come to Paris with me instead of going to some Mulhausen or other .
'That is a fine thing ! ' said Shcherbatsky , laughing . ' I am only preparing to begin to live . ' 
'Yes , I thought so too till lately ; but now I know that I shall soon die . ' 
Levin was saying what of late he had really been thinking .
He saw death and the approach of death in everything ; but the work he had begun interested him all the more .
After all , he had to live his life somehow , till death came .
THE KARENINS , HUSBAND AND WIFE , continued to live in the same house and to meet daily , but they were wholly estranged .
Karenin made it a rule to see his wife every day , so as not to give the servants any grounds for making conjectures , but he avoided dining at home .
Vronsky never came to the Karenins ' house , but Anna met him elsewhere and her husband knew it .
Karenin expected the passion to pass , as everything passes ; all would be forgotten and his name not dishonoured .
She had not the least idea what would settle it , but was quite certain that it would now come very soon .
Involuntarily submitting to her judgment , Vronsky too expected something , not dependent on him , to clear up all these difficulties .
In the middle of the winter he spent a very dull week .
He had been chosen to act as guide to a foreign Prince , and was obliged to show him the sights of Petersburg .
In the mornings they went sight @-@ seeing , and in the evenings took part in the national amusements .
He had been to Spain , where he arranged serenades and became intimate with a Spanish woman who played the mandoline .
In Switzerland he had shot a chamois , in England he had jumped hedges in a pink coat and shot two hundred pheasants for a bet .
He had been in a harem in Turkey , ridden an elephant in India , and now in Russia he wanted a taste of distinctive Russian amusements .
But , on the whole , of all the Russian amusements the Prince liked the French actresses , a ballet girl , and white @-@ seal champagne best .
He was obliged to be on his guard the whole time not to deviate from the path of severe official respect , for fear of being insulted .
The Prince 's manner toward the very people who , to Vronsky 's astonishment , were ready to go through fire and water to provide Russian amusements for him , was contemptuous .
His opinion of Russian women , whom he wanted to study , more than once made Vronsky flush with indignation .
But the chief reason why the Prince 's presence oppressed Vronsky was that he saw himself reflected in the Prince , and what he saw in that mirror was not flattering to his vanity .
The Prince was a very stupid , very healthy and very cleanly man - and nothing more .
He was a gentleman , it is true , and Vronsky could not deny it .
He was quiet and not cringing with those above him , free and simple with his equals , and contemptuously good @-@ natured with his inferiors .
Vronsky was the same , and considered it very meritorious to be so , but in his relations with the Prince he was the inferior and felt indignant with that condescendingly good @-@ natured treatment .
'Stupid ox ! can I really be like that myself ? ' he thought .
ON RETURNING HOME Vronsky found a note from Anna awaiting him .
She wrote , ' I am ill and unhappy .
I cannot go out , neither can I go on any longer without seeing you .
Come this evening ; Alexis Alexandrovich is going to the Council and will remain there till ten . ' 
After wondering for a moment at the strangeness of her asking him straight out to come to her house in spite of her husband 's injunctions , he decided to go .
He had that winter been promoted to the rank of colonel , had left the regiment , and was living alone .
He woke up in the dark trembling with fear , and hurriedly lit a candle .
Yes , yes , the peasant , the beater - I think he was small and dirty with a tangled beard - was stooping down and doing something or other , and suddenly began to say strange words in French .
That is all there was in that dream , ' he thought . ' But why did it seem so terrible ? '
He vividly recalled the peasant and the incomprehensible words that the man had uttered , and a shudder of terror ran down his back .
'What nonsense ! ' he thought , glancing at his watch .
It was already half past eight .
He rang for his valet , dressed hurriedly , and went out into the porch , having quite forgotten his dream and feeling worried only by the fact that he was late .
As he drove up to the Karenins ' porch he again glanced at his watch and saw that it was ten minutes to nine .
A high narrow brougham with a pair of grey horses stood before the front door .
'She was coming to me , ' thought Vronsky ; ' that would have been better .
It is unpleasant for me to enter this house .
But no matter ! I cannot hide , ' he thought ; and with the manner ; habitual to him since childhood , of one who has nothing to be ashamed of , Vronsky got out of his sledge and went to the door .
The door opened and the hall porter with a rug over his arm called to the coachman .
Vronsky , though not in the habit of noticing details , noticed the look of surprise on the man 's face .
In the doorway he nearly knocked up against Karenin .
The gaslight lit up Karenin 's worn , bloodless face beneath the black hat , and his white tie showing from beneath the beaver collar of his overcoat .
His dull , expressionless eyes were fixed on Vronsky 's face .
Vronsky bowed , and Karenin silently moved his lips , lifted his hand to his hat , and went out .
Vronsky saw him get into the carriage without looking round , take the rug and a pair of opera @-@ glasses through the carriage window ; then he disappeared in the darkness .
Vronsky entered the hall .
His brows were knit and his eyes shone with a proud , angry light .
'That is a nice position ! ' he thought . ' If he struggled , if he defended his honour , I could act and could express my feelings ; but this weakness or meanness ...
He puts me in the position of an impostor - which I did not and do not mean to be . ' 
Since the explanation with Anna in the Vrede Gardens Vronsky 's ideas had changed .
While still in the hall he heard her retreating footsteps , and knew that she had been waiting and listening for him , but had now gone back to the drawing @-@ room .
'No ! ' she cried when she saw him , and at the first sound of her voice tears filled her eyes . ' No ! If things go on like this for long , it will happen much , much sooner ! '
No , no ! I won 't ! ...
I cannot quarrel with you .
I expect you could not help it .
She put both her hands on his shoulders and gazed at him long , with a deep look of ecstasy and yet searchingly .
She compared , as she did at every interview with him , the image her fancy painted of him ( incomparably finer than , and impossible in , actual existence ) with his real self .
He had to be at the Council ! '
'He had been and had come back , and afterwards went somewhere else .
But never mind : don 't speak about it .
He wished to say that he had been up all night and had fallen asleep , but seeing her excited and happy face he felt ashamed .
So he said that he had to go and report the Prince 's departure .
'But now that is all over ?
You would hardly believe how intolerable it was . ' 
She held her work in her hands , without crocheting , gazing at him with a strange , glittering , unfriendly look .
'Lisa called on me this morning ; they still visit me in spite of the Countess Lydia Ivanovna , ' she said , ' and she told me about your Athenian party .
How disgusting ! '
'I was only going to say that ... '
'It was Therese , whom you knew before ? '
'I was going to say ... '
'How horrid you men are !
How is it that you can forget that a woman cannot forget these things ? ' she said , getting more and more heated and thereby betraying the cause of her irritation . ' Especially a woman who cannot know your life .
Have I not told you that I have not a thought that I would hide from you ? '
'Yes ; yes ! ' she said , evidently trying to drive away her jealous thoughts . ' But if you only knew how hard it is for me !
But he could not at once remember what he had wished to say .
Then he thought himself unhappy , but happiness was all in the future ; now he felt that the best happiness was already in the past .
She was not at all such as he had first seen her .
Both morally and physically she had changed for the worse .
She had broadened out , and as she spoke of the actress there was a malevolent look on her face which distorted its expression .
He looked at her as a man might look at a faded flower he had plucked , in which it was difficult for him to trace the beauty that had made him pick and so destroy it .
'Well , what were you going to tell me about the Prince ?
They spoke of jealousy as ' the demon . ' ' Yes , what had you begun telling me about the Prince ?
'Oh , it was intolerable ! ' he said , trying to pick up the lost thread of what he had in his mind . ' He does not improve on nearer acquaintance .
If I am to describe him , he is a finely @-@ bred animal , like those that get prizes at cattle @-@ shows , and nothing more , ' he concluded in a tone of vexation which awoke her interest .
One can see that he has been educated only to have the right to despise education , as they despise everything except animal pleasures . ' 
'But don 't all of you like those animal pleasures ? ' she remarked , and he again noticed on her face that dismal look which evaded his .
'Why do you take his part so ? ' he said , smiling .
'I don 't take his part , and it is a matter of complete indifference to me , but I should say that as you did not like these pleasures you might have declined to go .
But it gives you pleasure to see Therese dressed as Eve ... '
'Again ! Again the demon ! ' said Vronsky , taking the hand which she had put on the table , and kissing it .
You don 't know how I have suffered while waiting for you !
I don 't think I have a jealous nature .
I am not jealous ; I trust you when you are here near me ; but when you are away , living your life , which I don 't understand ... '
'Well , and what happened ? Where did you meet Alexis Alexandrovich ? ' she suddenly asked , her voice ringing unnaturally .
'And he bowed like this to you ? '
She drew up her face , half closed her eyes and quickly changed the expression of her face , folding her hands ; and Vronsky saw at once upon her beautiful face the very look with which Karenin had bowed to him .
He smiled , and she laughed merrily , with that delightful laughter from the chest which was one of her special charms .
'He ? ' she said , sarcastically . ' He is perfectly contented . ' 
'Why are we all tormenting each other when everything might be so comfortable ? '
'But not he !
As if I did not know him , and the falsehood with which he is saturated ! ...
As if it were possible for anyone to live as he is living with me !
Could a man who has any feelings live in the same house with his guilty wife ?
Could he talk to her and call her by her Christian name ? '
And without meaning to , she again mimicked him : ' Ma chère Anna ; my dear ! '
Oh , if I were he , I should long since have killed , have torn in pieces , a wife such as I , and not have called her " Ma chère Anna . "
He is not a man but an official machine .
He does not understand that I am your wife , that he is a stranger , a superfluous.-.-. But don 't let us talk about him . ' 
'You are unjust , unjust , my dear , ' said Vronsky , trying to pacify her . ' But still , don 't let us talk about him .
Tell me what you have been doing ?
She looked at him with quizzical joy .
She had evidently remembered other comical and unpleasant sides of her husband 's character and waited for an opportunity to mention them .
'I expect it is not illness at all , but only your condition .
The mocking light in her eyes faded , but a smile of a different kind - the knowledge of something unknown to him , and gentle sadness - replaced the former expression of her face .
You were saying that our position was full of torment and should be put an end to .
If you only knew how hard it is on me ! What would I not give to be able to love you freely and boldly !
I should not be tortured , I would not torment you with my jealousy ...
It will happen soon , but not in the way you think . ' 
And at the thought of how it was going to happen she felt so sorry for herself that the tears came into her eyes and she could not continue .
She laid her hand , sparkling with rings and the whiteness of the skin , on his sleeve .
I did not want to tell you , but you make me do it .
Soon , very soon , everything will get disentangled and we shall be able to rest and not torment each other any more . ' 
'I do not understand , ' he said , though he did understand .
'You were asking when ?
Soon , and I shall not survive it .
Don 't interrupt , ' she said hurriedly . ' I shall die and I am very glad that I shall die : I shall find deliverance and deliver you . ' 
'That is right , that is better , ' she said , firmly pressing his hand . ' This is all , all that remains to us . ' 
He recovered and lifted his head .
'What rubbish , what senseless rubbish you are talking ! '
'A dream ? ' Vronsky instantly remembered the peasant of his dream .
'Oh , what nonsense !
But she would not allow him to stop her .
What she was saying was of too much importance to her .
'And that something turned round , and I saw it was a peasant with a rough beard , small and dreadful .
I wanted to run away , but he stooped over a sack and was fumbling about in it ... '
She showed how he fumbled in the sack : Her face was full of horror .
And Vronsky , remembering his dream , felt the same horror filling his soul .
'He fumbles about and mutters French words , so quickly , so quickly , and with a burr , you know : " Il faut le battre , le fer : le broyer , le pétrir ... "
[ It must be beaten , the iron : pound it , knead it . ]
Then I woke . ' 
'What nonsense , what nonsense ! ' said Vronsky , but he felt that there was no conviction in his voice .
Ring the bell , I will order tea .
But wait , it won 't be long and I ... '
The expression of her face changed instantaneously .
The horror and agitation were replaced by an expression of quiet , serious , and blissful attention .
He could not understand the meaning of this change .
She had felt a new life quickening within her .
KARENIN AFTER MEETING VRONSKY in his own porch went on as had been his intention to the Italian Opera .
He sat through the first two acts and saw everybody that it was necessary for him to see .
She had not fulfilled his condition and he was obliged to punish her and carry out his threat : to divorce her and take away her son .
He knew the difficulties connected with such a step : but he had said he would do it and was now obliged to do it .
He did not sleep at all , and his wrath , increasing in a kind of gigantic progression , had reached its utmost limits by the morning .
Anna , who thought that she knew her husband so well , was struck by his appearance when he entered .
His brow was knit , and his eyes , gloomily fixed before him , avoided looking at her ; his lips were firmly and contemptuously closed .
In his step , his movements , and the sound of his voice was such determination and firmness as his wife had never known in him .
He entered her boudoir and without saying ' Good morning ! ' went straight to her writing @-@ table , took up her keys , and opened the drawer .
'Sit down ! I must speak to you , ' he said , taking the letter @-@ case under his arm and pressing it so tight with his elbow that his shoulder went up .
Astonished and abashed , she silently looked at him .
'I told you that I would not allow you to see your lover here . ' 
'I wanted to see him in order ... '
She paused , unable to invent a reason .
'I wanted , I only wanted ... ' she said , flushing .
His coarseness irritated her and gave her boldness . ' Is it possible you do not feel how easy it is for you to insult me ? ' she said .
'I have not seen this new trait of cruelty in you before . ' 
'You call it cruelty when a husband gives his wife complete freedom while he affords her honourable shelter , on the one condition that she should observe the laws of propriety .
'It is worse than cruelty , it is - baseness , if you want to know ! ' Anna exclaimed in a burst of anger , and rose to go .
'Baseness ?
Since you wish to use that word - it is baseness to abandon a husband and a son for a lover and to go on eating the husband 's bread ! '
She did not say what she had said to her lover the day before , that Vronsky was her real husband and that he ( Karenin ) was superfluous , she did not even think it .
She felt all the justice of his words and only said softly :
'You cannot describe my position as being worse than I know it to be , but why do you tell me all this ? '
'Soon , very soon , it will come to an end of itself ! ' she muttered , and at the thought of the nearness of death , which she now desired , tears again filled her eyes .
'It will end sooner than you and your lover imagine !
You want to satisfy animal passions ... '
'Alexis Alexandrovich !
This is not only ungenerous , but not even gentlemanly - to hit one who is down . ' 
'That 's all very well , but you think only of yourself ! The sufferings of the man who was your husband do not interest you . What do you care that his whole life is wrecked and how much he has suf ... suf ... suffled ! '
Karenin was speaking so rapidly that he blundered and could not pronounce the word , and at last said suffled .
That struck her as funny ; but immediately after she felt ashamed that anything could seem funny to her at such a moment .
And for the first time she felt for him and put herself for an instant in his place , and was sorry for him .
But what could she say or do ?
He too was silent for a while and then again began in a less squeaky voice , coldly emphasizing certain chance words that had no special importance .
'I came to tell you ... ' said he .
'I cannot change anything , ' she whispered .
'I have come to tell you that I am going to Moscow tomorrow and shall not return to this house again , and that you will hear my decision through the lawyer whom I shall employ in the divorce suit .
My son will stay with my sister , ' said Karenin , making an effort to remember what he had wanted to say about his son .
'You want Serezha in order to hurt me , ' she said , looking at him from under her brows . ' You do not care for him ...
" Yes , I have even lost my affection for my son , because he is connected with my repulsion for you . But all the same I shall take him away .
And he was about to go , but now she stopped him .
I shall soon be confined , leave him ! '
Karenin flushed , and pulling away his hand left the room .
THE FAMOUS PETERSBURG LAWYER 'S waiting @-@ room was full when Karenin entered it .
The writing @-@ table accessories ( of which Karenin was a connoisseur ) were unusually good , as he could not help noticing .
One of the clerks , without rising from his chair , screwed up his eyes and addressed Karenin ill @-@ humouredly .
'The lawyer is engaged , ' replied the assistant sternly , and indicated with his pen the persons who were waiting .
'Can he not find time to see me ? ' said Karenin .
'Then I will trouble you to give him my card , ' said Karenin with dignity , seeing the impossibility of preserving his incognito .
His whole life had been spent in administrative activity , and therefore when he disapproved of anything his disapproval was mitigated by a recognition of the inevitability of mistakes and the possibility of improvement in everything .
In the new legal institutions he disapproved of the position occupied by lawyers .
But till now he had never had to deal with a lawyer and so had disapproved only in theory ; now his disapproval was strengthened by the unpleasant impression he received in the lawyer 's waiting @-@ room .
His face was intelligent and peasant @-@ like , but his dress was dandified and in bad taste .
'Come in , please ! ' said the lawyer to Karenin , and gloomily ushering his client in before him , he closed the door .
'Won 't you take a seat ? ' He pointed to a chair beside a writing @-@ table covered with papers , and himself took the principal seat , rubbing his little hands with their short fingers covered with white hair and bending his head to one side .
But hardly had he settled down when a moth flew across the table .
The lawyer , with a rapidity one could not have expected of him , separated his hands , caught the moth , and resumed his former position .
A scarcely perceptible smile moved the lawyer 's drooping reddish moustache .
'I should not be a lawyer if I could not keep the secrets entrusted to me !
Karenin glanced at him and saw that his intelligent grey eyes were laughing , as if he knew everything in advance .
'You know my name ? ' continued Karenin .
'I know you and , like every Russian , I know - ' here he again caught a moth - ' your useful activity , ' said the lawyer bowing .
Karenin sighed , collecting his courage , but having once made up his mind he went on in his squeaky voice without timidity or hesitation , emphasizing a word here and there .
'I have the misfortune , ' began Karenin , ' to be a deceived husband , and I wish legally to break off relations with my wife - that is , to be divorced , but in such a way that my son should not remain with his mother . ' 
'You want my assistance to obtain a divorce ? '
'Just so ! But I must warn you that there is a risk that I may be wasting your time .
I have come only for a preliminary consultation .
I wish for a divorce , but the form in which it can be obtained is of importance to me .
It is quite possible that if the forms do not coincide with my requirements I shall forgo my legitimate desire . ' 
'Oh , that is always so , ' said the lawyer , ' that is always open to you . ' 
The lawyer looked down at Karenin 's feet , feeling that the sight of his irrepressible joy might offend his client .
He glanced at a moth that flew past his nose and his hand moved , but did not catch it , out of respect for Karenin 's situation .
'Although the general outline of our laws relating to this matter is known to me , ' continued Karenin , ' I should like to know the forms in which such cases are conducted in practice . ' 
And on Karenin 's nodding affirmatively the lawyer continued , only occasionally casting a glance at Karenin 's face , which had grown red in patches .
'Divorce , under our laws , ' he said , with a slight shade of disapproval of the laws , ' as you are aware , may be granted in the following cases ...
Therefore , guided by the precedents , I have to inform you that cases of divorce all come to the following : - there is , I suppose , no physical defect or absence without news ? ... '
Karenin nodded affirmatively .
'- come to the following : adultery of husband or wife and the detection of the guilty party by mutual consent , or involuntary detection without such consent .
But Karenin remained silent , and so he began again : ' The most usual , simple , and reasonable way I consider to be adultery by mutual consent .
I should not venture so to express myself were I talking to a man of undeveloped mind , ' said the lawyer , ' but I expect it is comprehensible to you . ' 
Karenin was , however , so much upset that he did not at once understand the reasonableness of adultery by mutual consent and his perplexity was expressed in his looks ; but the lawyer immediately helped him .
'Two people can no longer live together - there is the fact . And if both agree about that , the details and formalities become unimportant , and at the same time it is the simplest and surest method . ' 
But he had religious requirements which hindered his acceptance of this method .
'It is out of the question in the present case , ' said he . ' Only one measure is possible : involuntary detection confirmed by letters which I have . ' 
In general , if you do me the honour to entrust the case to me , leave me to choose the means which should be used .
'If it is so ... ' Karenin began , growing suddenly pale ; but at that moment the other suddenly rose and went to the door to speak to his assistant , who had again come to interrupt him .
'Tell her we have not got a cheap sale on here ! ' he said and came back again .
As he was returning he furtively caught another moth .
'A fine state my furniture will be in when summer comes ! ' he thought , and frowned .
'Yes , you were saying ... ' he began
'I will write and let you know what I decide , ' said Karenin , rising and holding on by the table .
After a short pause he said , ' I may conclude from your words that a divorce could be obtained .
I would also ask you to let me know your terms ? '
'In a week 's time .
'Very well . ' 
The lawyer bowed deferentially , let his client pass out , and being left alone abandoned himself to his happy mood .
KARENIN HAD GAINED a brilliant victory at the Committee Meeting of the seventeenth of August ; but the consequence of that victory undermined his power .
Three months later the committee sent in its report .
The subject @-@ races ' conditions had been investigated from the political , administrative , economic , ethnographical , material , and religious points of view .
All the questions had received splendidly @-@ drafted answers : answers not open to doubts since they were not the result of human thoughts ( always liable to error ) , but were the outcome of official labours .
And the solutions arrived at were in accord with Karenin 's opinions .
But Stremov , who had been touched to the quick at the last meeting , made use of tactics for which Karenin was not prepared .
These measures , going beyond Karenin 's original idea , were accepted , and then Stremov 's tactics became manifest .
Stremov stood aside , pretending to have blindly followed Karenin 's plans and to be himself indignant now at what had been done , thus undermining Karenin .
But , in spite of failing health and family troubles , Karenin did not give in .
Karenin and a number of others saw danger in so revolutionary an attitude toward official documents and continued to support the data presented by the Committee .
In consequence , the higher circles and even Society became quite confused and , though everybody was deeply interested in the question , no one could make out whether the subject @-@ races were really suffering and perishing or were flourishing .
In these circumstances he took an important resolution .
He announced , to the surprise of the Committee , that he would ask to be allowed to go and investigate the matter himself , and having received permission he started for the distant Provinces .
'I consider it very fine of him , ' the Princess Betsy said , referring to it in a conversation with Princess Myagkaya . ' Why should they pay for post @-@ horses when everybody knows that we now have railways everywhere ? '
But the Princess Myagkaya did not agree , and was even irritated by Princess Tverskaya 's views .
'It is all very well for you to talk who possess I don 't know how many millions , ' she said . ' But I am very glad when my husband goes on inspection @-@ tours in summer .
It is very good for his health , and pleasant for him ; and we have an arrangement by which this allowance goes for the hire of a carriage and coachman for me . ' 
On his way to the distant Province Karenin stopped three days in Moscow .
On the day after his arrival he went to call on the Governor @-@ General .
At the crossing of Gazetny Street , where there is always a crowd of carriages and izvoshchiks , he suddenly heard some one calling out his name in such a loud and cheerful voice that he could not help looking round .
The lady too with a kind smile waved her hand to Karenin .
The lady with the children was Dolly .
Karenin did not wish to see anyone in Moscow , and certainly not his wife 's brother .
He raised his hat and was going on , but Oblonsky told the coachman to stop and ran across the snow .
'What a shame not to have sent word !
I am so glad to see you ! ' and he kicked his feet together to knock off the snow . ' What a shame not to send word ! '
'I could not find time : I am very busy , ' Karenin answered drily .
'Come and speak to my wife ; she is so anxious to see you . ' 
Karenin unfolded the rug he had wrapped round his legs , which were so sensitive to the cold , got out of the carriage , and making his way through the snow approached Dolly .
'What is the matter , Alexis Alexandrovich ? Why do you avoid us in this way ? ' Dolly smilingly asked .
'I was exceedingly busy !
Very pleased to see you , ' he said in a tone that expressed clearly that he was very sorry . ' How are you ? '
Karenin muttered something and was about to go , when Oblonsky stopped him .
'D 'you know what we 'll do to @-@ morrow ?
'Yes , do come ! ' said Dolly . ' We shall expect you at five or six , just as you like .
'She is well , ' replied Karenin , frowning . ' I shall be very pleased , ' and he went back to his carriage .
Karenin muttered something which Dolly could not catch amid the noise of passing vehicles .
Karenin got into his carriage and sat far back , so as neither to see nor to be seen .
'Queer chap ! ' said Oblonsky to his wife , and after glancing at his watch waved his hand in front of his face as a sign of endearment to his wife and children , and walked jauntily away along the pavement .
He turned round .
'You know that I must buy coats for Grisha and Tanya .
Give me some money . ' 
'Never mind ! Tell them I will pay ! ' and nodding his head to an acquaintance who was driving past he disappeared round the corner .
THE NEXT DAY WAS SUNDAY .
Besides giving her the necklace he wished to make an appointment to meet her after the ballet .
Having explained that he could not be there at the beginning of the performance , he promised to come for the last act , and take her to supper .
Oblonsky liked a good dinner , but liked still more giving a dinner @-@ party : not a big affair , but one select in food , drink , and guests .
He was in very high spirits .
Just two circumstances were not quite satisfactory , but they were drowned in the ocean of kind @-@ hearted joviality which overflowed his heart .
On the previous day Oblonsky had appeared on Service business in uniform ; the new superior was very pleasant and chatted with him as with an old acquaintance ; therefore Oblonsky now considered it his duty to call on him in a morning coat .
The thought that the new superior might not take this in good part was the second unpleasant circumstance , but Oblonsky felt instinctively that everything would ' turn out ' splendidly .
'After all , they 're all human beings , all men , just like us poor sinners , ' he thought , as he entered the hotel . ' What is there to be angry and quarrel about ? '
'You 've grown whiskers !
Will you show me the way ? And please find out whether Count Anichkin ' ( the new superior ) ' will receive me . ' 
'Yes , sir , ' replied Vassily with a smile .
He shook hands with the peasant and sat down without taking off his overcoat or hat .
'No , I have no time . I 've only come in for a moment , ' replied Oblonsky , throwing open his coat .
Later on he took it off and stayed for an hour , talking to Levin about bear @-@ hunting and also about personal matters .
'Now please tell me what you did abroad , and where you have been , ' said Oblonsky , when the peasant had left .
'Well , I stayed in Germany , in Prussia , in France , and in England - not in the capitals but in manufacturing centres .
'Not at all ! In Russia there cannot be a working @-@ class problem .
Oblonsky listened to Levin with attention .
'Well , what of that ? I never stop thinking of death , ' said Levin .
'It really is time for me to die .
'It is old ... But , do you know , when you have once grasped it clearly , everything becomes so insignificant !
I consider my ideas very important , yet they too turn out to be insignificant - and would be , even if it were as possible to carry them out as it was to surround this bear .
And so one passes one 's life finding distraction in hunting or in work , merely not to think of death . ' 
Oblonsky listened to Levin with an affectionate and subtle smile .
'Well , of course !
So now you have come round to my notion .
Do you remember how you used to fly at me for seeking enjoyment in life ?
Do not be so severe , O moralist ! ... '
'And do you know , life has less charm when one thinks of death , but it is more peaceful . ' 
However , I must be going , ' returned Oblonsky , rising for the tenth time .
'Don 't go yet ! ' said Levin , trying to detain him . ' When shall we meet again ?
'Well , I 'm a good one !
'Is he here ? ' asked Levin , and was going to inquire about Kitty .
'Then you will come ? '
'Yes , of course . ' 
'Well , then , at five , and in morning dress ! '
And Oblonsky got up and went downstairs to call on the new superior .
His instinct had not deceived him ; the dreadful new superior turned out to be a most affable man . Oblonsky had lunch with him and sat talking so long that it was going on for four when he arrived at Karenin 's .
KARENIN , AFTER RETURNING FROM CHURCH , spent the rest of the morning in the hotel .
The interview , though the deputation had been summoned on his initiative , was an affair that presented many difficulties and even dangers , and Karenin was very glad that it chanced to be in Moscow when he was there .
The members of the deputation had not the least comprehension of their role or of their duties .
Karenin had a prolonged tussle with them , and wrote out for them a programme which they were not to overstep , and having dismissed them he wrote two letters to Petersburg .
One of them contained instructions regarding this deputation .
In this matter his chief helper was the Countess Lydia Ivanovna , who was a specialist in deputations .
He was just closing his letter to the lawyer when he heard Oblonsky 's voice .
Oblonsky was disputing with Karenin 's servant , and insisting that he should be announced .
'No matter ! ' thought Karenin , ' it is even better so . I will tell him about my position with regard to his sister at once , and will explain why I cannot dine at his house . ' 
'Ask the gentleman in ! ' he said in a loud voice , collecting his papers and placing them inside a blotter .
'I can 't come , ' Karenin , who was standing , said coldly , without offering his visitor a seat .
Oblonsky opened his clear and shining eyes wide .
'Why can 't you ?
What do you mean ? ' he demanded in French , quite taken aback .
'I must tell you that I can 't come because the family connection hitherto subsisting between us must now be severed . ' 
I mean , how ?
Why ? ' said Oblonsky , smiling .
'Because I am about to take proceedings to divorce your sister , my wife .
But before Karenin could finish what he was about to say , Oblonsky did something quite unexpected .
'Dear me , Alexis Alexandrovich ! What are you talking about ? ' he cried , a look of pain appearing on his face .
'It is true . ' 
'Forgive me , but I can 't - I can 't believe it ... '
'Yes , I am under the painful necessity of applying for a divorce , ' he continued .
'I will tell you just one thing , Alexis Alexandrovich !
There must be some misunderstanding ! ' said Oblonsky .
'Ah , if it were only a misunderstanding ! ... '
'Wait a moment - I understand , ' Oblonsky interrupted him . ' But of course ... Only this : one should not be in a hurry . No ! One shouldn 't , shouldn 't be in a hurry . ' 
'I was not in a hurry , ' replied Karenin , coldly . ' In a case like this it was impossible to consult anyone .
Well , before doing so , see my wife and talk it over with her !
She cares for Anna as for a sister , she is fond of you , and she is a wonderful woman .
Karenin considered , and for a while Oblonsky gazed at him , full of sympathy , without breaking the silence .
'You will come and see her ? '
The reason I did not call on you is that I think our relationship must be altered . ' 
I don 't see it .
But do , now do come and see my wife ! '
'Ah , we look at the matter differently , ' said Karenin , coldly . ' However , don 't let us talk about it . ' 
'But why won 't you come ?
Supposing you came to dinner to @-@ day ?
My wife expects you .
She is a wonderful woman .
'Well , and have you seen him ? ' said Karenin with a venomous smile .
'Oh yes , he came to the Council yesterday .
He seems to know his business perfectly and is very active . ' 
'Yes , but in what direction ? ' asked Karenin . ' Toward getting things done , or toward changing what has been done already ?
We had lunch , and I showed him how to make that stuff - you know - wine with oranges .
It is very refreshing , and it is amazing that he did not know of it .
Oblonsky looked at his watch .
'Dear me , it is getting on for five and I have still to call on Dolgovushin ! ...
You have no idea how grieved I and my wife will be if you don 't . ' 
'Believe me , I appreciate it and hope that you will not repent it , ' Oblonsky replied , smiling .
As he put on his overcoat while walking away , his arm struck the servant 's head . He laughed and went out .
'Five o 'clock , and morning dress , if you please ! ' he sang out , returning to the door .
IT WAS PAST FIVE , and some of the visitors had already arrived , when the master of the house came home .
He entered together with Sergius Ivanich Koznyshev and Pestsov , who had met on the doorstep .
Those two were the chief representatives of the Moscow intellectuals , as Oblonsky called them .
Both were men respected for their characters and abilities .
And as there is nothing less amenable to agreement than disagreement on semi @-@ abstract themes , they not only disagreed in their opinions but had long been accustomed without anger to ridicule each other 's incorrigible delusions .
They were entering when Oblonsky overtook them , and were talking about the weather .
Prince Alexander Dmitrich Shcherbatsky , and young Shcherbatsky , Turovtsyn , Kitty , and Karenin were already in the drawing @-@ room .
Oblonsky noticed at once that , without him , things were going badly in the drawing @-@ room .
They all sat like ' a parish priest 's wife visiting ' ( as the old Prince Shcherbatsky expressed it ) , evidently puzzled as to why they were all assembled there , and forcing out words in order not to remain silent .
To have a drink at the Chateau des Fleurs would be more in my line . ' 
Kitty kept looking toward the door , gathering courage not to blush when Constantine Levin should enter .
Young Shcherbatsky , who had not been introduced to Karenin , tried to look as if this did not make him feel at all awkward .
He was the chief cause of the iciness which had frozen all the visitors till Oblonsky 's arrival .
Having patted Turovtsyn on the shoulder , he whispered something funny in his ear and got him to sit down next to Dolly and the old Prince .
Then he told Kitty that she was looking very nice , and introduced young Shcherbatsky to Karenin .
In a moment he had kneaded all that Society dough in such a way that the drawing @-@ room was in first @-@ rate form , and was filled with animated voices .
Only Constantine Levin had not arrived .
But he met Levin at the door .
'As if you ever could help being late ! ' said Oblonsky taking his hand .
'Are there many people here ?
Whom have you got ? ' asked Levin with a blush , knocking the snow off his cap with his glove .
Come , I will introduce you to Karenin . ' 
Oblonsky , in spite of being Liberal , knew that to be acquainted with Karenin could not but be an honour , and therefore treated his best friends to that honour .
But at that moment Constantine Levin was not in a state fully to appreciate the pleasure of such an acquaintance .
He had not seen Kitty since the memorable evening when he had met Vronsky , excepting for that one moment when he had caught sight of her on the high road .
In the depths of his soul he had felt sure that he should meet her that evening , but to maintain his freedom of thought he had tried to assure himself that he did not know it .
Now , when he heard that she was here , he was suddenly filled with such joy and at the same time with such fear , that it took away his breath and he could not utter what he wished to say .
The same as before , or as she was that morning in the carriage ?
'Oh , do introduce me to Karenin ! ' he brought out with difficulty , and with despairing determination he entered the drawing @-@ room and saw her .
She was not as she had been before nor as he had seen her in the carriage . She was quite different .
She was frightened , shy , shamefaced , and therefore even more charming .
She saw him as soon as he entered . She had been waiting for him .
He came up , bowed , and silently held out his hand .
Had it not been for the light quivering of her lips and the moisture that made her eyes brighter , her smile would have appeared almost calm when she said :
'What a long time it is since we saw one another ! ' while with a desperate resolve her cold hand pressed his .
'You have not seen me but I saw you , ' said Levin with a beaming smile of joy . ' I saw you on your way to Ergushevo from the station . ' 
'You were driving to Ergushevo , ' said Levin , feeling that the happiness with which his heart was overflowing was taking his breath away .
'How did I dare to connect anything that was not innocent with this pathetic being !
Yes , what Darya Alexandrovna told me seems to be true , ' he thought .
Oblonsky took his arm and led him up to Karenin .
'Let me introduce you , ' and he gave their names .
'Very pleased to meet you again , ' said Karenin coldly , as he shook hands with Levin .
'Are you acquainted ? ' asked Oblonsky with surprise .
'We spent three hours together in a railway carriage , ' said Levin with a smile , ' but we parted filled with curiosity , as people do after a masquerade , at any rate I did . ' 
If you please , ' said Oblonsky , motioning them toward the dining @-@ room .
They stood round the scented vodka and the delicacies , and the conversation about the Russification of Poland between Koznyshev , Karenin , and Pestsov gradually slackened in the expectation of dinner .
Koznyshev , who knew better than anyone how at the end of a most abstract and serious dispute unexpectedly to administer a grain of Attic salt and thereby to change his interlocutor 's frame of mind , did so now .
Karenin was arguing that the Russification of Poland could only be accomplished by high principles which the Russian Administration must introduce .
Pestsov insisted that one nation can assimilate another only when the former is more densely populated .
Koznyshev agreed with both , but with limitations .
When they had left the drawing @-@ room Koznyshev , to finish the conversation , remarked with a smile .
Everybody laughed , and Oblonsky most merrily of all .
'Yes , that is the very best way , ' he said , chewing some cheese and filling the glass with a special kind of vodka . And the conversation was really ended by the joke .
Levin smiled .
'None at all .
On the contrary a child can kill a bear , ' he said , making room , with a slight bow , for the ladies who were coming up to the side @-@ table with the hostess .
There was , it would seem , nothing unusual in what she had said , but for him what a meaning there was , inexpressible in words , in every sound and every movement of her lips , her eyes , and her hands as she said it !
There was a prayer for forgiveness , and trust in him , and a caress - a tender , timid caress , and a promise , and hope , and love for him in which he could not but believe and which suffocated him with joy .
'No , we went to the Tver Province .
And gaily and amusingly he told how after not sleeping all night he , in his sheep @-@ skin coat , had rushed into Karenin 's compartment .
'The rights of passengers to a choice of seats are very ill @-@ defined , ' said Karenin , wiping the tips of his fingers on his handkerchief .
'I noticed that you were not quite sure what to make of me , ' said Levin with a good @-@ natured smile , ' so I hastened to start an intellectual conversation , to expiate my sheep @-@ skin . ' 
He did not know that Levin felt as if he had grown a pair of wings .
Levin knew that she was listening to his words and liked hearing him , and that was the only thing he cared about .
Not only in that room but in the whole world there existed for him nothing but Kitty and himself , and he had now acquired a great significance and importance .
He felt himself at a height that made him giddy , and there , somewhere far below , were all these good excellent Karenins , Oblonskys , and the rest of the world .
Quite casually , without looking at them and just as if there was no other place to put them , Oblonsky placed Levin and Kitty side by side .
'Well , you might sit here , ' he said to Levin .
The dinner was as good as the dinner service , a thing of which Oblonsky was a connoisseur .
The soup , Marie Louise , had succeeded to perfection , the tiny pasties melted in one 's mouth and were flawless .
Two footmen and Matthew , wearing white ties , manipulated the food and the wines unostentatiously , quietly , and quickly .
The dinner was a success on the material side , and no less so on the non @-@ material side .
The conversation , sometimes general and sometimes tête @-@ à @-@ tête , never ceased , and toward the end became so animated that the men left the table without ceasing to talk , and even Karenin was infected .
PESTSOV LIKED TO BRING HIS DISCUSSIONS TO A FINISH , and had not been satisfied with Koznyshev 's remark , especially as he felt the fallacy of his own opinion .
'I did not mean , ' he began over his soup , addressing Karenin , ' the density of population alone , but that combined with firm foundations . It is not principles that count . ' 
'It seems to me , ' replied Karenin deliberately and languidly , ' that it is one and the same thing .
In my opinion only that nation which is more highly developed can influence another , only that ... '
'But the question is , ' interrupted Pestsov in his deep voice - he was always in a hurry to speak and always seemed to stake his whole soul on what he was talking about - ' what does " higher development " consist of ?
The English , the French , or the Germans , which of them is more highly developed ?
Which will nationalize the other ?
We see that the Rhine has become Frenchified , yet the Germans do not stand on a lower level ! ' he shouted . ' There is some other law ! '
'I think that the influence will always be on the side of the truly educated , ' said Karenin slightly raising his eyebrows .
'But what should we consider to be the signs of " true education " ? ' said Pestsov .
'I fancy that those signs are well known , ' replied Karenin .
'You are a classic , Sergius Ivanich !
Have a glass of claret ? ' said Oblonsky .
'Natural science has just as great an educational and mind @-@ developing influence , ' Pestsov joined in . ' Take astronomy , take botany , or zoology with its system of general laws ! '
'I can 't quite agree with you , ' answered Karenin . ' It seems to me that we must admit that the process of studying the forms of a language has in itself a beneficial effect on spiritual development .
Koznyshev was going to say something but Pestsov 's deep bass interrupted him .
Koznyshev quietly waited to put in his word , evidently ready with triumphant retort .
'Exactly . ' 
But now we know that those classical education @-@ pills contain the salutary virtue of anti @-@ nihilism and we offer them boldly to our patients ...
But supposing it has not that salutary virtue after all ? ' he concluded , adding the grain of Attic salt .
Everybody laughed at Koznyshev 's ' pills , ' and Turovtsyn , who had at last heard the something funny for which he had been waiting as he listened to the conversation , laughed particularly loudly and merrily .
Oblonsky had made no mistake in inviting Pestsov .
With Pestsov there , intellectual conversation could not stop for a moment .
Hardly had Koznyshev with his joke put an end to the discussion of one question before Pestsov immediately raised another .
'One cannot even admit that the Government had that aim in view , ' he said .
'The Government is evidently guided by general considerations and is indifferent to the influence its measures may have .
For instance , it ought to consider the education of women injurious , yet it established courses of lectures and universities for women . ' 
And the conversation at once veered to a new subject - the education of women .
Karenin expressed the view that the higher education of women is generally confounded with the question of women 's emancipation , and that was the only reason for considering it injurious .
'I , on the contrary , think that these two questions are firmly bound together , ' said Pestsov . ' It is a vicious circle .
We must not forget that the subjection of women is so widespread and so old that we often refuse to recognize the abyss that separates them from us . ' 
'Undoubtedly . ' 
'But if women , in some rare exceptional cases , can fill these posts , it seems to me that you should not speak of " rights . "
Everybody will agree that when we fill the office of juryman , town councillor , or telegraph clerk , we feel that we are fulfilling a duty .
So it would be more correct to say that women are seeking for duties , and quite rightly .
'You are quite right , ' said Karenin . ' I think the only question is whether they are capable of fulfilling these duties . ' 
'In all probability they will be extremely capable , ' interjected Oblonsky , ' when education is more widely diffused among them .
We see this ... '
'They thought the same of the negroes before their emancipation , ' said Pestsov angrily .
'The thing that seems strange to me is that women should look for new duties , ' said Koznyshev , ' while , as we see , men unfortunately generally avoid theirs . ' 
'Duties are connected with rights , power , money , honours : that is what women are seeking , ' said Pestsov .
'It is just as if I were to strive for the right of being a wet nurse , and were offended because they pay women for it and won 't pay me , ' said the old Prince .
Turovtsyn burst into loud laughter , and Koznyshev felt sorry he had not made that remark himself .
Even Karenin smiled .
'Yes , but a man can 't be a wet nurse , ' said Pestsov , ' while a woman ... '
'Oh yes , an Englishman on board ship did once nurse his baby , ' said the old Prince , allowing himself this indelicacy in his daughters ' presence .
'There will be about as many women officials as there are of such Englishmen , ' said Koznyshev .
'But we are defending a principle , an ideal ! ' said Pestsov in his sonorous bass . ' Women wish to have the right to be independent and educated .
It even struck him as strange that they should care to talk about things that could make no difference to anyone .
In the same way what was being said about the rights of the education of women should have interested Kitty .
But now it did not interest her at all .
They began by Levin 's telling Kitty in answer to her question of how he could have seen her in the carriage in the summer , how he was going back from the hay fields along the high road and met her .
'It was early in the morning .
I expect you had only just woke up .
Your mother was asleep in her corner .
It was a lovely morning .
Something important ? '
'Was I not very untidy ? ' she thought , but seeing the rapturous smile which the recollection of these details evoked she felt that the impression she had produced was a very pleasing one .
'I really don 't remember . ' ' How pleasantly Turovtsyn laughs ! ' said Levin , looking with pleasure at his moist eyes and shaking body .
'I see you think he is a bad man . ' 
'Not bad , but a mere cipher . ' 
Change your opinion quickly , ' said Kitty . ' I too did not think much of him , but he is ... he is a dear fellow and wonderfully kind @-@ hearted .
'How did you manage to find out his heart ? ' ' He and I are great friends .
I know him very well .
And fancy ! ' she went on in a whisper , ' he was so sorry for her that he stopped and helped her to nurse the children .
Really , he stayed three weeks in the house and looked after the children like a nurse . ' 
'I am telling Constantine Dmitrich about Turovtsyn and the scarlet fever , ' she said , leaning over toward her sister .
'Yes ? it was wonderful ! he is splendid ! ' said Dolly , looking toward Turovtsyn who felt that he was being talked about , and giving him a gentle smile .
Levin looked at Turovtsyn again and wondered how it was he had failed to realize what a charming man he was .
'I am sorry , very sorry . I shall never again think ill of anyone ! ' he said merrily ; expressing what he sincerely felt at the moment .
Pestsov more than once during dinner @-@ time flew at these questions , but Koznyshev and Oblonsky carefully diverted him from them .
When they rose from table and the ladies had left the room , Pestsov did not follow them but turned to Karenin and began to state the chief cause of inequality .
The inequality between husband and wife , in his opinion , lay in the fact that the infidelity of a wife and that of a husband were unequally punished both by law and by public opinion .
'No , I don 't smoke , ' quietly replied Karenin , and , as if wishing to show that he was not afraid of the conversation , he turned with a cold smile to Pestsov .
As one always seems to knock a sore place , so that day Oblonsky felt that unfortunately the conversation kept striking Karenin 's sore place .
'Oh ! ' said Karenin indifferently , and raising his eyebrows he went to the drawing @-@ room .
'I am so glad you came , ' said Dolly with a frightened smile , as she met him in the sitting @-@ room through which he had to pass : ' I must speak with you .
Karenin , with the same look of indifference , produced by his raised eyebrows , sat down beside her and feigned a smile .
'Yes , ' he said , ' especially as I wished to ask you to excuse me for having to go away at once .
Dolly was firmly convinced of Anna 's innocence , and felt herself growing pale and her lips trembling from anger with this cold , unfeeling man who so calmly intended to ruin her innocent friend .
'Alexis Alexandrovich , ' she said , looking into his eyes with desperate determination . ' I asked you about Anna and you did not give me an answer .
'I think she is well , Darya Alexandrovna , ' replied Karenin without looking at her .
'Alexis Alexandrovich , forgive me , I have no right to ... but I love Anna like a sister , and respect her and I beg , I implore you to tell me what has happened between you , what do you accuse her of ? '
Alexis Alexandrovich winced , and almost closing his eyes bowed his head .
'I don 't , I don 't believe it , I cannot believe it ! ' Dolly said , clasping her bony hands with an energetic movement .
She rose quickly , put her hand on Karenin 's sleeve and said , ' We shall be disturbed here , come this way , please . ' 
He rose and obediently followed her into the schoolroom .
They sat down at the table covered with leather cloth all cut about with penknives .
'I don 't believe it , I don 't ! ' she uttered , trying to catch his eyes , which avoided hers .
'One can 't disbelieve facts , Darya Alexandrovna , ' said he , emphasizing the word fact .
'No , no , it can 't be !
No , for God 's sake ! ... you are mistaken , ' said Dolly , raising her hands to her temples and closing her eyes .
Karenin smiled coldly with his lips only , wishing to prove to her and to himself the firmness of his conviction ; but this passionate defence , though it did not shake him , lacerated his wound .
He began speaking with more animation .
'It is difficult to make a mistake when a wife herself announces to her husband that eight years of married life and a son have all been an error , and that she wants to begin life from the beginning again , ' he said crossly , sniffing .
'Anna and - vice ... I cannot combine them , I cannot believe it ! '
'Darya Alexandrovna , ' he said , now looking straight at Dolly 's kind , excited face and feeling his tongue involuntarily loosened . ' I would give much for the possibility of doubting .
While I was in doubt it was hard , but not so hard as it is now .
While I doubted , I had hope ; but now there is no hope left and all the same I doubt everything .
I doubt everything so much that I hate my son , and sometimes believe he is not my son .
There was no need for him to say this .
Dolly had understood it as soon as he looked her in the face . She felt sorry for him , and her faith in her friend 's innocence was shaken .
'Oh , it is terrible , terrible !
But can it be true that you have decided on a divorce ? '
'I have decided to take the final step .
'Nothing to do , nothing to do ! ' she muttered with tears in her eyes . ' No , there is something else to do , ' she said .
'I understand , I understand very well , ' said Dolly and her head dropped .
She was silent , thinking of herself and her own sorrow , and then suddenly and energetically she raised her head and folded her hands as in prayer . ' But wait !
Think of her !
What will become of her if you throw her off ? '
'I have thought , Darya Alexandrovna , and have thought deeply , ' said Karenin .
His face flushed in blotches and his dim eyes looked straight at her .
Dolly now pitied him with all her heart . ' I did that very thing when she herself informed me of my shame ; I let everything go on as before .
'Anything but divorce ! ' answered Dolly .
'No , this is too awful .
'What can I do ? ' said Karenin , shrugging his shoulders and raising his eyebrows .
The recollection of his wife 's last delinquency irritated him so much that he again became as cold as he had been at the beginning of the conversation . ' I am very grateful for your sympathy , but it is time for me to go , ' he said rising .
'No , wait a bit !
You should not ruin her .
Wait a bit . I will tell you about myself .
I married , and my husband deceived me ; in my anger and jealousy I wished to abandon everything , I myself wished ...
But I was brought to my senses , and by whom ?
Anna saved me .
And here I am living ; my children growing , my husband returns to the family and feels his error , grows purer and better , and I live ...
I have forgiven , and you must forgive . ' 
'I cannot forgive ; I don 't wish to and don 't think it would be right .
I have done everything for that woman and she has trampled everything in the mud which is natural to her .
'Love those that hate you ... ' whispered Dolly shamefacedly .
Karenin smiled contemptuously .
He had long known all that , but it could not apply to his case .
'Love them that hate you , but you can 't love them whom you hate .
Forgive me for having upset you .
WHEN EVERYBODY WAS LEAVING THE TABLE Levin wanted to follow Kitty into the drawing @-@ room but was afraid she would not like it because it would make his attentions to her too obvious .
So he stopped with the group of men , taking part in their conversation . But without looking through the open door at Kitty he was conscious of her movements , her looks , and the place in the drawing @-@ room where she sat .
He began at once , and without the slightest effort , to fulfil the promise he had made her , of thinking well of and always liking everybody .
The conversation had turned to the question of village communes , in which Pestsov saw some special principle which he called the ' chorus principle . ' 
Levin did not agree either with Pestsov or with his brother Sergius , who , in a way of his own , both admitted and did not admit the importance of the Russian Communal System .
But he talked to them only with the idea of getting them to agree and softening their controversy .
He was not at all interested in what he himself said , still less in what they were saying , and only desired one thing - that everybody should feel contented and pleased .
He now knew the one thing that was important .
And that one thing was at first there in the drawing @-@ room , but afterwards began moving and paused in the doorway .
Without looking round he felt a pair of eyes and a smile directed toward him , and he could not help turning .
'I thought you were going to the piano , ' he said , moving toward her . ' That is what I miss in the country - music . ' 
'No , we were only coming to call you away . Thank you for coming , ' she said , rewarding him with a smile as with a gift .
'What is the use of arguing ?
No one ever convinces another . ' 
'Yes , you are quite right , ' said Levin , ' for the most part , people argue so warmly only because they cannot make out what it is that their opponent wants to prove . ' 
This was what he wanted to express .
She wrinkled her forehead , trying to understand .
But as soon as he began to explain she understood .
'I see : one must find out what one 's opponent is contending for , what he likes , and then one can ... '
Levin smiled joyfully : he was so struck by the change from the confused wordy dispute with his brother and Pestsov to this laconic , clear , and almost wordless communication of a very complex idea .
Shcherbatsky left them , and Kitty went up to a table prepared for cards , sat down , took a piece of chalk , and began drawing concentric circles on the new green cloth of the table .
They went back to the conversation at dinner about women 's rights and occupations .
Levin agreed with Dolly , that a girl who does not get married can find woman 's work in the family .
He supported this view by saying that no family can dispense with a help , and that in every family , rich or poor , there are and must be nurses , either paid or belonging to the family .
'No , ' said Kitty , blushing , but looking all the more boldly at him with her truthful eyes : ' A girl may be so placed that she cannot enter into a family without humiliation , while she herself ... '
Submitting to her mood , he felt in his whole being an ever @-@ increasing stress of joy .
'Oh , I have scribbled over the whole table ! ' she said , and putting down the chalk moved as if to get up .
'How can I remain here alone , without her ? ' he thought horror @-@ struck , and took up the chalk . ' Don 't go , ' he said and sat down at the table . ' I have long wished to ask you something ! '
He looked straight into her kind though frightened eyes .
'Please do . ' 
'There , ' he said , and wrote the following letters , - W , y , a : i , c , n , b ; d , y , m , t , o , n ?
These letters stood for : When you answered : it can not be ; did you mean then or never ?
It was quite unlikely that she would be able to make out this complicated sentence ; but he looked at her with an expression as if his life depended on her understanding what those letters meant .
She glanced seriously at him and then , leaning her frowning forehead on her hand , began reading .
Occasionally she looked up at him , her look asking him : ' Is it what I think ? '
'What word is this ? ' he asked pointing to the ' n ' which stood for never .
Suddenly his face beamed - he had understood .
The letters meant ' Then I could not answer otherwise . ' 
He looked at her questioningly , and timidly .
'Only then ? '
'Yes , ' answered her smile .
And now ? ' he said .
I will tell you what I wish , what I very much wish ! ' and she wrote these initial letters : T , y , m , f , a , f , w , h .
This meant , ' that you might forgive and forget what happened . ' 
He seized the chalk with nervous , trembling fingers , broke it , and wrote the initial letters of the following : ' I have nothing to forget or forgive , I never ceased to love you . ' 
He sat down and wrote out a long sentence .
For a long time he could not make out what she meant and he often looked up in her eyes .
He could not find the words she meant at all ; but in her beautiful eyes , radiant with joy , he saw all that he wanted to know .
And he wrote down three letters .
But before he had finished writing she read it under his hand , finished the sentence herself , and wrote the answer : ' Yes . ' 
'Playing " secretary " ? ' said the old Prince approaching them . ' Come now , we must be going , if you mean to come to the theatre . ' 
Levin rose and accompanied Kitty to the door .
Everything had been said in that conversation . She had said that she loved him , and would tell her father and mother , and he had said that he would call in the morning .
In order not to be alone and to deceive time , he needed to be with and to talk to somebody .
Oblonsky would have been the pleasantest companion for him now , but he was going to an evening party as he said ( really to the ballet ) .
Levin only had time to tell him he was happy and fond of him and would never , never forget what he had done for him .
Oblonsky 's look and smile showed Levin that he understood him rightly .
'Then it 's not time to die yet ? ' asked Oblonsky with feeling , pressing Levin 's hand .
Dolly too , when saying good @-@ bye to him , spoke as if congratulating him , saying : ' I am so glad you and Kitty have met again .
She did not understand how high and unattainable for her all this was , and she should not have dared to refer to it .
Levin took leave of them but , not to remain alone , he fastened on to his brother .
'Where are you going ? '
'Well , I 'll come with you .
'Why not ? Let us go , ' answered Koznyshev , smiling . ' What has happened to you to @-@ day ? '
'To me ?
Happiness is with me , ' said Levin , letting down the window of the carriage in which they were driving . ' You don 't mind ?
It is so stuffy here .
'I am very glad , she seems a fine gi ... ' he began .
'She is a fine girl ' were words so ordinary , so insignificant , so inappropriate to his feelings .
'You may say that to @-@ morrow , to @-@ morrow , but nothing more !
Will they really let me in to the meeting ? '
'What are you speaking on to @-@ night ? ' asked Levin not ceasing to smile .
That was plain from the confused and embarrassed manner in which he read the report .
Then followed the discussion .
And then Sviyazhsky ( he too was there ) also said something very finely and nobly .
They were doing no one any harm , and everybody was pleased .
That was quite evident from the way they spoke to him , and the tenderness and affection with which they all , even strangers , looked at him
'Well , are you contented ? ' asked Koznyshev .
'Quite .
I never thought it would be so interesting .
Sviyazhsky came up and asked Levin to come home with him and have some tea .
Levin could not at all think or remember why he had ever felt dissatisfied with Sviyazhsky or what he had thought lacking in him .
He was an intelligent and remarkably kind fellow .
Sviyazhsky questioned him about his affairs in the country , as usual disbelieving in the possibility of devising anything that had not already been discovered in Western Europe ; but now Levin did not consider this at all unpleasant .
On the contrary he felt that Sviyazhsky was right , and that the whole business was insignificant , and he noticed the wonderful gentleness and delicacy with which Sviyazhsky avoided saying that he was right .
The ladies were especially nice ; it seemed to Levin that they already knew all about it and sympathized with him but did not mention it out of delicacy .
Sviyazhsky , yawning , showed him to the hall and wondered at the strange state his friend was in .
It was past one .
Levin returned to the hotel and the thought of how with his impatience he would spend the remaining ten hours frightened him .
The attendant on duty lighted his candle and was going away , but Levin stopped him .
Egor , the attendant , of whom Levin had taken no notice heretofore , turned out to be a very intelligent , good , and above all very kind man .
'I say , Egor , don 't you find it difficult to keep awake ? '
'What 's one to do ?
It turned out that Egor had a family , three boys and a girl who was a seamstress and whom he wanted to marry to an assistant in a harness business .
Levin took this opportunity to express to Egor his opinion that in marriage the chief thing is - love , and that when there is love there will always be happiness because happiness lies always within oneself .
'A wonderfully kind man ! ' thought Levin .
'And you , Egor , when you married , did you love your wife ? '
'How can one help it ? ' answered Egor .
And Levin saw that Egor too was in an exultant state and wished to tell him all his most intimate feelings .
'My life too was very curious .
From a child I ... ' he began with shining eyes , evidently infected by Levin 's exultation as men get infected by others ' yawning .
But at that moment a bell rang , Egor went away and Levin remained alone .
He had scarcely eaten anything at dinner and had refused both tea and supper at Sviyazhsky 's , but could not think of eating .
He had not slept the night before but could not think of sleep either .
The room was cool , but he felt suffocated with heat .
He looked now at the cross , now at the star , and inhaled the fresh frosty air which flowed with a regular current into the room , following , as in a dream , the images and memories that arose in his fancy .
Towards four o 'clock he heard steps in the corridor and looked out .
He passed dejectedly , frowning and coughing .
'Poor , unfortunate fellow ! ' thought Levin , and tears of affection and pity for the man filled his eyes .
He shut the little window , washed , dressed , and went out into the street .
THE STREETS WERE STILL EMPTY .
The front door was locked , everybody was still sleeping .
He went back to his room in the hotel and ordered coffee .
The day @-@ waiter , not Egor this time , brought it to him .
Levin wished to have a talk with him , but the bell rang and the waiter went away .
Levin tried to drink a little coffee , and put a piece of roll into his mouth , but his mouth could do nothing with it .
It was past nine when he reached the Shcherbatskys ' porch a second time .
It would be necessary to live through another two hours at least .
All that night and morning Levin had lived quite unconsciously , and felt quite outside the conditions of material existence .
He was sure that he could fly upwards or knock down the corner of a house , were it necessary .
He spent the rest of the time walking about the streets , looking at his watch , and gazing around .
Two children going to school , some pigeons that flew down from the roof , and a few loaves put outside a baker 's window by an invisible hand touched him particularly .
All these things were so unusually beautiful that Levin laughed and cried with joy .
After a long round , through the Gazetny Street and the Kislovka , he returned to the hotel , put his watch in front of him , and sat down waiting till it should be twelve .
In the next room they were saying something about machines and fraud , and coughing as people do of a morning .
Levin went out into the porch .
With joyful faces they surrounded Levin , disputing among themselves , and offering him their services .
Trying not to offend the others , and promising to let them too drive him later on he hired one and told him to drive to the Shcherbatskys ' .
The izvoshchik was charming with the white band of his shirt showing from under his coat and clinging closely to his full , red , sturdy neck .
The izvoshchik knew the Shcherbatskys ' house , and rounding his elbows in a manner specially respectful to his fare called ' Whoa ! ' and stopped at the porch .
The Shcherbatskys ' hall @-@ porter certainly knew everything .
That was evident from the smile in his eyes and the tone in which he said :
'It 's long since you were here last , Constantine Dmitrich ! '
Not only did he know everything , but he evidently rejoiced and made efforts to hide his joy .
Glancing into his kind old eyes , Levin felt something new even in his happiness .
Won 't you leave it here ? ' he said when Levin turned back for his cap .
That meant something .
'Whom shall I announce you to ? ' asked the footman .
The footman was young , of the new @-@ fashioned kind , and a dandy , but a very kind and good fellow , and he too understood it all .
The young lady ... ' said Levin .
The first person he met was Mlle Linon .
She was passing through the dancing @-@ hall and her curls and her face shone .
He had scarcely begun to speak to her when he heard the rustle of a dress outside the door , his eyes no longer saw Mlle Linon , and the joyful terror of the nearness of his happiness seized him .
Mlle Linon hurriedly left him and went toward the other door .
She did not walk but was borne toward him by some invisible force .
He saw nothing but her clear , true eyes , frightened by the same joy of love which filled his own heart .
Those eyes beamed nearer and nearer to him , dazzling him with their glow of love .
She stopped so close that she touched him .
Her arms rose and her hands dropped on his shoulders .
She had done everything she could - she had run up to him and given herself entirely , shyly , and joyfully .
He put his arms round her and pressed his lips to her mouth that was waiting for his kiss .
She too had not slept all night and had waited for him the whole morning .
Her mother and father had definitely given their consent and were happy in her happiness .
She had prepared herself to meet him alone , and had rejoiced at the idea , yet had felt timid and bashful and had not known what she would do .
She had heard his step and his voice and had waited behind the door for Mlle Linon to go .
'Come to Mama ! ' she said , taking him by the hand .
He took her hand and kissed it .
'Can it be true ' he said at last in a smothered voice . ' Dear , I cannot believe that you love me . ' 
'Then it 's all finished !
Love her .
'Papa ! ' exclaimed Kitty and closed his mouth with her hands .
'Well , well , I won 't ! ' he said . ' I am very , very ... plea ...
THE PRINCESS SAT IN HER ARMCHAIR silently smiling , and the Prince seated himself beside her .
Kitty stood close to her father 's chair , still holding his hand .
The Princess was the first to break the silence and bring all their thoughts and feelings back to the practical side of life , and for the first moments this seemed strange and even painful to them all .
'Here he is , ' said the old Prince , pointing to Levin . ' He is the principal person concerned . ' 
If you ask me - the betrothal to @-@ day and the wedding to @-@ morrow ! '
'Well then , next week . ' 
'Why not ? '
'What an idea ! ' said the mother with a pleased smile at his haste . ' And the trousseau ? '
As if a trousseau and a betrothal ceremony and all that could spoil my happiness ! Nothing can spoil it ! '
'Well , you see , I don 't know at all ; I only expressed my wish , ' he said , to excuse himself .
The Princess went up to her husband , kissed him and was about to go away , but he stopped her , embraced her , and tenderly , like a young lover , kissed her several times , with a smile .
The old couple seemed to have become confused for the moment , and not to know whether it was they who were again in love or only their daughter .
When they had gone Levin came up to his betrothed and took her hand .
He had now mastered himself and was able to speak , and there was much he had to say to her ; but what he said was not at all what he had intended .
'How well I knew it would happen !
I never dared hope , yet in my soul I was always certain , ' said he . ' I believe it was predestined . ' 
I must ask you : can you forget it ? '
'Perhaps it was all for the best .
You have much to forgive me .
I must tell you ... '
He referred to one of the things he had decided to tell her .
'No , not now , later ! ' he said .
I am afraid of nothing .
'It is settled that you will have me , whatever I may be ... You will not reject me ...
Their conversation was interrupted by Mlle Linon , who with a feigned yet affectionate smile came to congratulate her favourite pupil .
Afterwards relatives arrived , and that beatific tumult began which did not cease until the day after the wedding .
All that time Levin felt uncomfortable and bored , but the stress of his joy went on increasing .
All that time he felt that many things he did not know were expected of him , but he did all he was told , and it all gave him joy .
'Now we shall eat some sweets , ' said Mlle Linon , and off went Levin to buy sweets .
'I am very pleased indeed , ' said Sviyazhsky , ' I advise you to go to Fomin 's for the flowers . ' -
'Are they necessary ? ' and off he went to
'Are presents required ? ' and off he rushed to Fulda , the jeweller 's .
The confession he had promised her was the one painful episode of that time .
He consulted the old Prince , and with his permission gave Kitty his diary , which contained the facts that were tormenting him .
He had written the diary with the intention of showing it to his future bride @-@ elect .
She was religious and had never doubted the truth of her religion , but the lack of external religion in him did not affect her at all .
She knew , through her love , his whole soul , and saw in it what she desired , and the fact that that spiritual condition is called agnosticism was quite indifferent to her .
The other confession made her weep bitterly .
Levin had not handed her the diary without an inward struggle .
'Take , take those dreadful books back ! ' she cried , pushing away the note @-@ books that lay on the table before her . ' Why did you give me them ? ...
But no - it was best after all , ' she added , pitying the despair on his face . ' But it is dreadful , dreadful ! '
His head drooped and he remained silent , unable to speak .
'You will not forgive me ? ' he whispered .
'Yes , I have forgiven you , but it is dreadful ! '
However , his happiness was so great that this confession did not impair it , but only gave it a new tinge .
She forgave him , but after that he felt yet more unworthy of her , morally bowed still lower before her , and valued still more highly his undeserved happiness .
INVOLUNTARILY REVIEWING THE IMPRESSIONS left on his mind by the conversations at dinner and after , Karenin returned to his solitary room .
What Dolly had said about forgiveness had merely vexed him .
Whether or not to apply the Christian principle to his own case was too difficult a question to be lightly discussed , and Karenin had long since answered it in the negative .
Evidently everybody had agreed with that , though they were too polite to say so .
Karenin ordered tea , sat down at a table , took up a time @-@ table , and began planning his journey .
'Two telegrams , ' said the valet , entering . ' Excuse me , your Excellency - I had only just gone out . ' 
Karenin took the telegrams and opened them .
The first contained the news that Stremov had obtained the very appointment Karenin had been hoping for .
He threw down the telegram and flushed . Rising , he began to pace the room .
'Quos vult perdere dementat , ' he thought , quos being those who had had a hand in making the appointment .
How was it they did not see that by giving him that post they were ruining themselves and their own prestige ?
'Something else of the same kind , ' he thought bitterly , as he opened the second telegram .
It was from his wife , and Anna , written in blue pencil , was the first word he saw . ' I am dying .
I beg and entreat you , come !
I shall die easier for your forgiveness , ' he read .
Smiling contemptuously , he threw down the telegram .
'She would not hesitate at any deception .
She was going to be confined ; perhaps that is the illness .
But what can they be aiming at ?
To legitimize the child , compromise me , and prevent a divorce ? ' he reflected . ' But there is something about dying ... '
He re @-@ read the telegram , and was suddenly struck by the direct meaning of the words .
'Supposing it is true ? ' he said to himself . ' If it is true , and at the moment of suffering and approach to death she is sincerely repentant , and I , believing it to be false , refuse to come ?
It would not only be cruel and everybody would condemn me , but it would be stupid on my part . ' 
'Peter , keep the carriage !
I am returning to Petersburg , ' he told the valet .
He decided to go back to Petersburg and see his wife .
While on his way he did not again think about what he should do .
He dared not think of it , because when he imagined what would happen he could not drive from his mind the thought that her death would at once dissolve all the difficulties of the situation .
A carriage , with a coachman asleep on the box , and an izvoshchik were standing at the entrance .
As he entered the hall Karenin dragged forth his resolve as it were from a remote corner of his brain , and conned it over . It said :
'How is your mistress ? '
'Safely delivered yesterday . ' 
Karenin halted and turned pale .
Now he clearly realized how much he had desired her death .
Korney , wearing his morning apron , came running downstairs .
'Very bad , ' he said . ' There was a consultation yesterday and the doctor is here now . ' 
'Take my things , ' said Karenin ; and somewhat relieved by the news that there was still some hope of her dying , he entered the ante @-@ room .
On the hall @-@ stand was hanging a military coat , and he noticed it .
'Who is here ? '
'The doctor , the midwife , and Count Vronsky . ' 
Karenin passed on to the inner apartments .
There was no one in the drawing @-@ room , but the midwife , with lilac ribbons in her cap , came out of Anna 's boudoir .
She approached Karenin , and with a familiarity bred by death 's approach took him by the hand and led him toward the bedroom .
'Thank God you have come !
She talks only about you and nothing but you , ' said she .
'Be quick and bring the ice ! ' came the authoritative sound of the doctor 's voice from the bedroom .
Karenin entered the boudoir .
Beside the table , sitting with his side toward the back of a low chair , was Vronsky , his hands covering his face , weeping .
I am entirely in your hands ... but allow me to remain here , please ! ... However , I am in your hands .
Anna 's voice , talking about something , came from the bedroom .
It sounded cheerful and animated , and its articulation was extremely distinct .
Karenin entered and went up to the bed .
She appeared not only fresh and well but in the best of spirits .
She spoke rapidly , in a ringing voice with extraordinarily accurate intonations , full of feeling .
'Because Alexis ... I am speaking of Alexis Alexandrovich - how strange and terrible that they are both called Alexis , is it not ? - Alexis would not have refused me .
I should have forgotten and he would have forgiven ...
Oh God ! What weariness !
Give me some water , quick !
Oh , but it will be bad for her , for my little girl !
Well , I agree , it will be better so .
He will come back and it will pain him to see her .
'Anna Arkadyevna , he has come !
Here he is , ' said the midwife , trying to draw Anna 's attention to Alexis Alexandrovich .
One must know his eyes . Serezha 's are just the same - that 's why I can 't bear to see them .
Have they given Serezha his dinner ?
Suddenly she recoiled , became silent and frightened , and put her arms before her face as if in expectation of a blow ; she had seen her husband .
'No , no ! ' she began again . ' I am not afraid of him .
I am in a hurry , because I have no time . I have not long to live , I shall soon become feverish and then I shall no longer understand anything .
Now I understand , understand everything and see everything ! '
And every time he did so he saw her eyes looking at him with such tender and ecstatic emotion as he had never before seen in them .
'Wait a bit - you don 't know ...
Wait , wait ! ... ' she paused as if to collect her thoughts . ' Yes , ' she continued , ' yes , yes , yes !
This is what I wished to say .
Don 't be surprised at me ; I am still the same ...
But there is another in me as well , and I am afraid of her . She fell in love with that other one , and I wished to hate you but could not forget her who was before .
Here they are , my hands and feet and fingers , whole hundredweights are on them .
My fingers , see how enormous they are !
But all this will soon end ...
I only want one thing : forgive me , forgive me completely !
I am dreadfully bad , but the nurse told about the holy martyr - what was her name ? - she was worse .
And I shall go to Rome , there is a wilderness there and then I shall be in nobody 's way . I shall only take Serezha and the little girl ...
You are too good ! ' With one hot hand she held his , while with the other she pushed him away .
He was not thinking that the law of Christ , which all his life he had tried to fulfil , told him to forgive and love his enemies but a joyous feeling of forgiveness and love for his enemies , filled his soul .
He knelt with his head resting on her lent arm , which burnt through its sleeve like fire , and sobbed like a child .
She put her arm round his bald head , moved closer to him , and looked up with an expression of proud defiance .
They have come again , why don 't they go away ? ...
Oh , take these furs off me ! '
The doctor moved her arms and carefully drew the bedclothes over her shoulders .
She meekly lay down on her back and gazed with radiant eyes straight before her .
'Remember that the only thing I want is your forgiveness , I wish for nothing else ...
Why does he not come in ? ' she cried , calling to Vronsky on the other side of the door . ' Come , come !
Vronsky came to her bedside and , on seeing Anna , again hid his face in his hands .
'Uncover your face ! Look at him !
He is a saint , ' said she . ' Uncover , yes , uncover your face ! ' she went on angrily .
Karenin took Vronsky 's hands and moved them away from his face , terrible with its look of suffering and shame .
Karenin held out his hand , without restraining the tears that were falling .
'Thank God , thank God ! ' she cried . ' Now everything is ready .
How badly those flowers are drawn , not a bit like violets , ' and she pointed to the wallpaper .
Oh , my God , my God ! '
And she began to toss in her bed .
The doctor and his colleagues said it was puerperal fever , which in ninety @-@ nine cases out of a hundred ended fatally .
All day she was feverish , delirious , and unconscious .
At midnight she lay insensible , with hardly any pulse .
Vronsky went away , but came again in the morning to inquire . Karenin met him in the ante @-@ room and said : ' Remain here : she may ask for you , ' and himself showed him into Anna 's boudoir .
Toward morning she had become excited and animated , and her thoughts and words flowed rapidly ; but again this state lapsed into unconsciousness .
On the third day she was just the same and the doctors gave some hope .
That day Karenin went out into the boudoir where Vronsky sat , and having locked the door took a seat opposite him .
'Alexis Alexandrovich , ' said Vronsky , feeling that an explanation was coming . ' I am unable to think , unable to understand .
He was about to rise , but Karenin took him by the hand and said :
'I beg you to hear me ; it is necessary .
I must explain to you my feelings , those that have guided me and will guide me in future , so that you may not misunderstand me .
You know that I resolved on a divorce and had even taken steps toward obtaining it .
I will not conceal from you that when I took action I was in a state of indecision ; I suffered , and I confess that I was haunted by a desire for vengeance .
On receiving the telegram I came here with the same feelings - more than that , I wished for her death . But ... '
He stopped and reflected whether he should reveal his feelings or not . ' But I saw her and forgave her .
And the joy of forgiving has revealed my duty to me .
He rose , and sobs broke his voice .
Vronsky got up at once , and stooping before him looked up into his face without unbending his back .
He could not understand Karenin , but felt that here was something high , and inaccessible to one with his outlook on life .
AFTER HIS CONVERSATION with Karenin Vronsky went out on to the Karenins ' porch and then stopped , recalling with difficulty where he was and where he ought to go .
He felt ashamed , humiliated , guilty , and deprived of the possibility of cleansing himself from his degradation .
He felt himself knocked quite out of the rut along which he had hitherto trodden so proudly and so lightly .
All the apparently solid habits and rules of his life suddenly seemed false and inapplicable .
Vronsky could not help being conscious of this .
They had suddenly exchanged roles .
Vronsky felt Karenin 's greatness and his own humiliation , . Karenin 's rightness and his own wrongdoing .
He felt that the husband in his sorrow was magnanimous , while he himself was mean and trivial in his deceptions .
But the consciousness of his degradation toward the man whom he had unjustly despised accounted for but a small portion of his grief .
During her illness he had learnt to know her thoroughly , had seen into her very soul ; and it seemed to him that he had never loved her before .
And just now , when he knew her and loved her in the right way , he had been humiliated before her and had lost her for ever , leaving her nothing but a shameful memory of himself .
But most terrible of all was the ridiculous , shameful figure he had cut when Karenin was pulling his hands from before his shame @-@ suffused face .
Returning home after the three sleepless nights , Vronsky did not undress but lay down prone on a sofa , with his head on his folded arms .
His head was heavy .
'To sleep , to forget ! ' he said to himself with the calm certainty of a healthy man that being tired and in want of sleep he would at once fall asleep .
And in fact in a moment his thoughts grew confused and he began to fall into the abyss of forgetfulness .
His eyes were wide open as if he had not slept at all .
'Sleep , sleep , ' he kept repeating to himself .
But with his eyes closed he could see yet more distinctly Anna 's face , as he had seen it on that memorable evening before the race .
'All that is ended and never will be again , and she wishes to efface it from her memory .
I can 't live without it .
Then how can we be reconciled - how can we be reconciled ? ' said he aloud , and went on unconsciously repeating those words .
This reiteration prevented other images and memories which were thronging his brain from arising .
Again , following each other with great rapidity , his happiest moments rose in his fancy ; and with them his recent humiliation .
'Take away his hands , ' Anna 's voice is saying .
He still lay trying to fall asleep , though he had lost all hope of succeeding , and kept repeating in a whisper random words connected with disjointed thoughts , in order to prevent other images from rising .
He listened and heard repeated in a strange mad whisper the words , ' Unable to value , unable to enjoy ; unable to value , unable to enjoy . ' 
'What is this ? Am I going mad ? ' he asked himself .
Fingering a tassel of the cushion , he tried to think of Varya as he had last seen her .
But to think of anything extraneous was painful .
He moved the cushion and pressed his head against it , but his eyes would not remain closed without effort .
He jumped up and sat down .
His thoughts glided quickly over his life unconnected with his passion for Anna .
'Ambition ?
Serpukhovskoy ?
Society ?
The Court ? ' he could not dwell on any of these things .
'That 's how one goes mad , ' he said again , ' and how one shoots oneself so as not to be ashamed , ' he concluded slowly .
Going up to a door he closed it , then with fixed gaze and tightly clenched teeth , approached the table , took up his revolver , examined it , turned it to a loaded chamber , and pondered .
For a minute or two he stood motionless with bowed head , a strained expression of effort on his face , holding the revolver in his hand .
'Of course ! ' he said to himself , as if led to a definite conclusion by a logical , continued , and clear line of reasoning .
In reality that convinced ' Of course ! ' was merely the outcome of the repetition of a round of fancies and recollections similar to those he had already gone over dozens of times in the last hour .
They were the same memories of happiness lost for ever , the same thoughts of the senselessness of all that life had in store for him , and the same consciousness of his humiliation .
And they followed in the same rotation .
He did not hear the sound of a shot , but a powerful blow on the chest knocked him off his feet .
He wished to steady himself by the table , dropped the revolver , reeled , and sat down on the floor , looking about him in astonishment .
He made an effort and understood that he was on the floor , and , seeing blood on the tiger @-@ skin and on his hand , realized that he had tried to shoot himself .
'Stupid ! ...
Missed , ' he muttered , feeling with his hand for the revolver .
It was close to him but he sought it further away .
Continuing his search he leaned over to the other side , and unable to keep his balance , fell down bleeding .
The elegant servant with the whiskers , who often complained to his friends about the weakness of his nerves , was so upset when he saw his master lying on the floor , that he left him to bleed to death and ran away to get help .
He forgave Vronsky and pitied him , especially when reports of Vronsky 's desperate action reached him .
He pitied his son too , more than he had done before , and reproached himself for not having paid more attention to him .
But for the new @-@ born little girl he had a peculiar sentiment , not of pity alone but even of tenderness .
Several times a day he went to the nursery , and remained there so long that the nurses , who had been shy in his presence , became quite used to him .
At such moments especially Karenin felt quite calm and at peace with himself , seeing nothing exceptional in his position and nothing that ought to be altered .
But as time went on he saw more and more clearly that , however natural his position might appear to him at the time , he would not be allowed to remain in it .
He felt that everybody looked at him with questioning surprise without understanding him , expecting something from him ; and especially he was aware of the insecurity and artificiality of his relation to his wife .
When the softened mood caused by the nearness of death had passed , Karenin began to notice that Anna feared him , was oppressed by his presence , and avoided looking him straight in the eyes .
It was as if she wished , yet could not make up her mind , to say something , and foreseeing that their present relation could not continue , expected something from him too .
At the end of February Anna 's newborn daughter , also named Anna , happened to fall ill .
Karenin had been in the nursery that morning , and having given orders to send for the doctor , had gone to the Department .
Toward four o 'clock , having finished his work , he returned home .
On entering the ante @-@ room he saw there a handsome footman in gold @-@ braided livery with a bearskin cape , holding a cloak lined with white fur .
'Who is here ? ' asked Karenin .
'Princess Elisabeth Federovna Tverskaya , ' answered the footman with a smile , - as it seemed to Karenin .
All through that difficult time Karenin noticed that all his worldly acquaintances , especially the women , displayed a particularly lively interest in him and his wife .
He noticed in all these acquaintances a kind of joy , which they suppressed with difficulty , like the joy he had noticed in the lawyer 's eyes and again just now in the footman 's .
Everybody seemed elated , as if they were giving some one in marriage .
When they met him they inquired with scarcely hidden pleasure about Anna 's health .
The presence of Princess Tverskaya and the memories associated with her , coupled with the fact that he had never liked her , was unpleasant to Karenin , and he went straight to the nursery .
In the front nursery Serezha , lying with his chest on the table and his legs on a chair , was drawing something and chattering merrily .
An English nursery governess , who since Anna 's illness had replaced the French governess with the boy , sat doing some crochet @-@ work . She hurriedly rose , curtseyed , and nudged Serezha .
Karenin passed his hand over his son 's hair , answered the governess 's inquiry about Anna 's health , and asked what the doctor had said about baby .
'The doctor says there is no danger and has ordered baths , sir . ' 
'But she is still suffering , ' remarked Karenin , listening to the crying child in the next room .
'I think the nurse is unsuitable , sir , ' said the Englishwoman with decision ..
'Why do you think so ? ' he asked , stopping short .
'The same thing happened in Countess Paul 's case .
Karenin reflected a moment and then entered the other room .
'Still no better ? ' asked Karenin .
'Very restless , ' said the head @-@ nurse in a whisper .
'Miss Edwards says that perhaps the nurse has no milk , ' he said .
'I think so too , Alexis Alexandrovich . ' 
'Then why did you not say so ? '
The nurse was an old family servant , and in her simple words Karenin thought he noticed a hint at his position .
The baby screamed louder , catching her breath and growing hoarse .
'The doctor must be asked to examine the nurse , ' said Karenin .
In that smile also Karenin thought he saw himself and his position ridiculed .
'Unfortunate child ! ' said the nurse , hushing the baby and continuing to walk up and down with it .
Karenin sat down on a chair and with a look full of suffering and weariness watched the nurse as she paced the room .
When the child was pacified and laid in her deep cot , and the nurse after smoothing the little pillow went away , Karenin rose , and stepping with difficulty on tiptoe approached the infant .
Stepping on the soft carpet , as he approached the door he involuntarily overheard a conversation which he had no wish to hear .
'If he had not been going away I should understand your refusal and his too .
But your husband must be above that , ' Betsy was saying .
Don 't talk about it , ' answered Anna in an excited voice .
'Yes , but you can 't but wish to say good @-@ bye to a man who tried to shoot himself for your sake ... '
'It 's just for that reason that I don 't wish it . ' 
Karenin , with a frightened and guilty face , stopped short and thought of returning unnoticed ; but coming to the conclusion that this would be undignified he turned , coughed , and went toward the bedroom door .
Anna , in a grey dressing @-@ gown , with her black hair cropped short but already growing again like a thick brush over her round head , sat on a couch .
A usual when she saw her husband all her animation vanished from her face ; she bowed her head and glanced uneasily at Betsy .
'Ah ! ' she exclaimed , as if in surprise , ' I am so glad you are at home .
I have not seen you since Anna 's illness .
I have heard everything ... all about your attentiveness .
Yes , you are a wonderful husband ! ' she said with a significant and affable expression , as if she were conferring on him an Order of Highmindedness for his conduct toward his wife .
Karenin bowed coldly , and kissing his wife 's hand asked about her health .
'I think I am better , ' she said , avoiding his eyes .
'But your face looks feverish , ' said he , emphasizing the word feverish .
'We have been talking too much , ' said Betsy . ' I know it was selfish of me and I am going . ' 
'No , please stay !
Karenin cracked his fingers and bowed his head .
'You said , my love , that it would depend on Alexis Alexandrovich . ' Betsy corrected her .
'Oh no ! I can 't receive him , and it would lead ... ' She stopped suddenly and glanced inquiringly at her husband , who was not looking at her . ' In a word , I don 't wish ... '
Karenin drew nearer and was going to take her hand .
Her first impulse was to draw away her hand from his moist one with the thick swelling veins , that was seeking hers ; but with evident effort she pressed it .
'Well , good @-@ bye , my precious ! ' said Betsy , rising again .
She kissed Anna and went out .
Karenin followed her .
'Alexis Alexandrovich !
Alexis Vronsky is honour personified , and besides he is leaving for Tashkend . ' 
'Thanks for your sympathy and advice , Princess !
But the question whom my wife will and whom she will not receive she will decide for herself . ' 
[ In Russian as in French and other languages the second person singular is used in conversation between intimates and also in speaking to inferiors . ]
However ... '
No need whatever ! '
'Let us say no more about it , ' she added more calmly .
'I left it to you to decide the matter , and am very glad to see ... ' began Karenin .
'That my wish coincides with yours , ' she rapidly completed his sentence , exasperated by the slowness with which he spoke , and knowing beforehand what he would say .
He assented . ' Yes , and Princess Tverskaya 's intrusion into this most difficult family matter is entirely out of place ...
Especially as she ... '
'I don 't believe anything they say about her , ' Anna put in quickly . ' I know that she is sincerely fond of me . ' 
Karenin sighed and paused .
She was agitatedly toying with the tassels of her dressing @-@ gown , glancing at him with that tormenting feeling of physical repulsion for which she blamed herself , but which she could not overcome .
The one thing she was longing for was to get rid of his obnoxious presence .
'I have just sent for the doctor , ' said he .
'Yes , but the little one keeps screaming , and they say the nurse has not enough milk . ' 
'I don 't blame ... '
'Yes , you are blaming me ! Oh God , why did I not die ? ' and she began to sob . ' Forgive me , I am upset ! I am unjust , ' she went on , controlling herself . ' But go ... '
'No , it can 't go on like that , ' he told himself with conviction after leaving his wife .
He saw clearly that the world and also his wife were demanding something from him , but exactly what this something was he did not comprehend .
All this was arousing a feeling of animosity in his soul , spoiling his peace of mind and depriving his achievement of all value .
Bad as this would be , it would be preferable to a complete rupture , which would place her in a hopeless and shameful position , and deprive him of all he loved .
But he felt powerless ; he was aware in advance that everybody would be against him and that he would not be allowed to do what now seemed so natural and good , that he would be obliged to do what was wrong but what seemed to them necessary .
BEFORE BETSY HAD PASSED OUT of the dining @-@ room Oblonsky , who had just come from Eliseyev 's , where newly @-@ arrived oysters were to be had , met her in the doorway .
'Ah , Princess ! What a pleasure to meet you , ' he began . ' And I have been at your house . ' 
'We meet only for a moment , as I am just going , ' said Betsy , smiling and putting on her glove .
There is nothing for which I am more thankful than for the revival of the old custom of hand @-@ kissing , ' and he kissed Betsy 's hand : ' When shall I see you again ? '
'You are not worth it , ' said Betsy , smiling .
'Yes , I am well worth it , because I have become the most serious of men .
I not only settle my own , but other people 's family affairs , ' said he with a significant glance .
'He will kill her , ' said Betsy in a significant whisper . ' This is impossible , impossible ... '
'I am very glad you think so , ' returned Oblonsky , shaking his head with an expression of grave , woebegone commiseration . ' That is why I have come to Petersburg . ' 
'The whole town is talking of it , ' she said . ' It is an impossible situation .
He does not understand that she is one of those women who cannot play with their feelings .
One of two things must happen : either he must take her away , acting energetically - or he must divorce her .
'Yes , yes ... exactly ! ' said Oblonsky , sighing . ' I have come because of that - I mean , not entirely because of it ...
I have been made Chamberlain , and had to tender my thanks .
'Well then , may God help you , ' said Betsy .
He found her in tears .
'Very , very badly .
'I think you give way to melancholy .
I know it is hard , but ... '
'I have heard it said that women love men for their very faults , ' Anna began suddenly , ' but I hate him for his virtues .
I cannot live with him .
Try and realize it : even his looks have a physical effect on me and drive me beside myself .
What am I to do ?
I was unhappy and thought it impossible to be more so ; but I could never have imagined such a terrible position as I am now in . Will you believe it ?
Knowing that he is a kind and generous man - that I am not worth his little finger - nevertheless I hate him !
I hate him for his generosity .
And there is nothing left for me but ... '
She was going to say ' death , ' but he did not let her finish .
'You are ill and excited , ' said he . ' Believe me , you are greatly exaggerating the case .
His soft comforting words and smiles had as soothing and calming an effect as almond oil , and Anna soon felt this .
And even worse than lost .
I. am not lost yet ; I cannot say " all is finished " : on the contrary , I feel that all is not yet finished .
I am like a tightly @-@ strung cord which must break .
There is no situation from which there is no escape . ' 
Only one ... '
Again he understood from her frightened face that she considered death to be the only escape , and did not let her finish .
'Not at all ! ' he replied . ' Listen .
Again he smiled his almond @-@ oil smile . ' I will begin at the beginning : you married a man twenty years older than yourself .
You married without love and without having known love .
'A dreadful mistake ! ' said Anna .
'But again I say that is an accomplished fact .
That is a misfortune , but that too is an accomplished fact .
Your husband has accepted that and forgiven you . ' He paused between each sentence , expecting her to make objections ; but she made no answer .
'That is so ? Now comes the question : Can you go on living with your husband ?
Do you wish it ?
Does he wish it ? '
'But you yourself say you cannot endure him ? '
'Yes , but let me ... '
'You can 't understand .
I feel that I am flying headlong over some precipice but must not even try to save myself .
'Never mind , we 'll spread out something to catch you .
I understand that you cannot take it upon yourself to express your wishes and feelings . ' 
'I have no wishes at all ... except that everything were at an end . ' 
Do you think it weighs on him less than on you ?
You suffer and he suffers ; what can come of that ?
While a divorce would solve the whole problem , ' said Oblonsky not without difficulty expressing his main idea , and looking at her significantly .
How happy I should be if I could arrange it , ' continued Oblonsky , now smiling more boldly . ' Don 't , don 't say a word !
If only God helps me to say what I feel !
OBLONSKY , WITH THE SAME RATHER SOLEMN EXPRESSION with which he was wont to take the chair at Council meetings , entered Karenin 's study .
Karenin , with his arms crossed behind him , was pacing up and down meditating on the very subject that his wife and Oblonsky had been discussing .
'I am not disturbing you ? ' asked Oblonsky , experiencing at the sight of his brother @-@ in @-@ law a feeling of embarrassment quite unusual with him .
Do you want anything ? ' Karenin answered reluctantly .
'Yes . I wished ... I must have ... I must have a talk with you , ' said Oblonsky , surprised at his own unaccustomed timidity .
That timidity was so unexpected and strange that Oblonsky could not believe it was his conscience telling him that what he was about to do was wrong .
'I hope you believe in my affection for my sister and my sincere attachment and respect for yourself , ' said he , blushing .
Karenin stopped . He made no reply , but the expression of submissive self @-@ sacrifice on his face struck Oblonsky .
'I intended to talk to you about my sister and your mutual position , ' said Oblonsky , still struggling with his unwonted timidity .
Karenin smiled sadly , looked at his brother @-@ in @-@ law , and without replying went to the table and took from it an unfinished letter which he handed to him .
'I think about that subject incessantly , and this is what I have begun to write , as I think I can put it better in writing , and my presence is distasteful to her , ' he said , holding out the letter .
Oblonsky took the letter , looked with perplexed amazement at the dull eyes fixed on him , and began reading :
'I see that my presence is distasteful to you .
Hard as it was for me to assure myself of this , I see that it is so , and there is no help for it .
I do not blame you , and God is my witness that when I saw you ill , I resolved with my whole soul to forget everything that had come between us and to begin a new life .
I do not repent and never shall repent of what I did , as my only desire was for your welfare , the welfare of your soul ; but now I see that I have not succeeded .
Tell me yourself what would give you real happiness and peace of mind !
I submit myself entirely to your wishes and sense of justice . ' 
Oblonsky returned the letter and went on looking at his brother @-@ in @-@ law with the same amazement , not knowing what to say .
That silence was so disconcerting to both that Oblonsky 's lips twitched painfully as he silently and fixedly gazed at Karenin 's face .
'That is what I wanted to tell her , ' said Karenin as he turned away .
'I must know what she wants , ' said Karenin .
'I am afraid she does not understand her position herself .
She is no judge of it , ' replied Oblonsky , growing more composed . ' She is crushed , literally crushed by your generosity .
If she reads this letter she will not have the strength to say anything - she will only hang her head lower than ever . ' 
How am I to find out what she wishes ? '
'If you will permit me to express my opinion , I think it is for you to say what you think should be done in order to put an end to this state of affairs . ' 
'There is a way out of every situation , ' said Oblonsky , rising and growing excited . ' There was a time when you wished to break with her ...
Should you be now convinced that you cannot make each other mutually happy ... '
'Happiness can be defined so differently !
However , I am ready to agree to anything - I want nothing at all .
And this new relation can only be established when both are free . ' 
Yes , divorce , ' Oblonsky answered , reddening .
What is to be done if they find out that life together has become impossible , as might happen anywhere ? '
Karenin sighed heavily and closed his eyes . ' There is only one thing to consider : does either party wish to remarry ?
For other and yet more important reasons also , divorce seemed out of the question .
To leave him with his mother was not possible ; the divorced mother would have another , an illegitimate family , in which the position and education of a stepson would in all probability be a bad one .
Should he keep him himself ?
He knew that would be revengeful and he did not wish for revenge .
But besides all this , what made divorce seem to Karenin more impossible than any other course was that by consenting to it he would by that very act ruin Anna .
And having connected these words with his forgiveness and with his attachment to the children , he now understood them in his own way .
Hundreds of times he had thought it over and had come to the conclusion that a divorce was not merely less simple than his brother @-@ in @-@ law considered it , but quite out of the question .
'The only question is , on what conditions you will agree to a divorce .
She does not want anything , does not ask for anything , but leaves all to your generosity . ' 
'You are upset . I quite understand .
'Yes , yes ! ' he cried in a shrill voice . ' I will take the disgrace , and even give up my son ... but ... but had we not better let it alone ?
However , do as you like ! ' and turning away so that his brother @-@ in @-@ law should not see his face , he sat down on a chair by the window .
It was very bitter , and he felt ashamed ; yet mixed with the bitterness and the shame he felt a sense of joy and emotion at the greatness of his own humility .
Oblonsky was touched .
Karenin would have answered , but could not for his tears .
'It is a fatal disaster and has to be faced . I regard this disaster as an accomplished fact and am trying to help both you and her , ' Oblonsky went on .
To his contentment was added an idea that had just occurred to him . When the affair was all settled he would ask his wife and intimate friends a riddle : ' What is the difference between me and a chemist ? '
Answer : ' A chemist makes solutions which do not make anyone happy , but I have made a dissolution and made three people happy ! '
Or , ' Why am I like a chemist ? ...
However , I will improve on it later , ' he said to himself with a smile .
ALTHOUGH VRONSKY 'S wound had missed the heart it was dangerous , and for several days he lay between life and death .
When he was first able to talk again his brother 's wife Varya was alone with him .
'Varya ! ' he said looking sternly at her , ' it went off accidentally !
Never speak of it , please , and tell everybody else that .
Without saying a word Varya bent over him and looked in his face with a joyful smile .
His eyes were clear and no longer feverish , but their expression was stern .
'Well , thank God ! ' she exclaimed . ' You are not in pain ? '
'A little , here , ' and he pointed to his chest .
He looked at her silently , his broad jaws set , while she bandaged him .
'I am not delirious ... Please arrange so that no one shall say that I shot myself on purpose . ' 
Only I hope you will not go letting it off accidentally any more , ' said she with an inquiring smile .
'I expect I shan 't , but it would have been better ... ' and he smiled gloomily .
Despite these words and that smile , which greatly perturbed Varya , when the inflammation left him and he became convalescent he felt that he had rid himself entirely of one part of his grief .
By his action he seemed to have washed off the shame and degradation he had previously felt .
Now he could think quietly about Karenin , fully realizing his generosity without being humiliated thereby .
Besides that , he got into his old rut again .
He found he could look people in the face once more , and he was able to live in accord with his former habits .
The one thing he could not tear out of his heart , although he continually struggled against it , was a regret bordering on despair at having lost Anna for ever .
Serpukhovskoy thought out a post for him in Tashkend and Vronsky accepted the proposition without the least hesitation .
But the nearer the hour for his departure approached the harder seemed the sacrifice he was making to what he considered his duty .
His wound was quite healed and he went about making preparations for his journey to Tashkend .
'Only to see her once more , and then to bury myself , to die ! ' he thought , as he was making a round of farewell calls , and he expressed this thought to Betsy .
It was with this message that Betsy went to Anna , and she brought him an answer in the negative .
'So much the better , ' thought Vronsky when he heard it . ' It would have been a weakness - would have taken away all the strength I have left . ' 
Next day Betsy herself came and announced that she had received , through Oblonsky , the definite news that Karenin consented to a divorce and that therefore Vronsky might see Anna .
Without seeing anyone or anything he ran up the stairs and entered her room with hurried steps - almost at a run .
Without thinking , or considering whether they were alone or not , he embraced her and covered her face , hands , and neck with kisses .
Anna had prepared herself for this meeting and had thought about what she would say to him ; but she had no time to say any of it , seized by his passion .
She wished to calm him and herself , but it was too late .
His passion communicated itself to her .
Her lip trembled so that for a long time she could not speak .
'Yes , you have taken possession of me and I am yours , ' she brought out at last , pressing his hands to her bosom .
'It had to be ! ' said he . ' As long as we live it will have to be .
'It is true , ' she said , growing paler and paler , putting her arms about his head . ' Still , there is something terrible in this , after what has been . ' 
'It will pass , it will all pass , and we shall be so happy !
If our love could be stronger , there being something terrible in it would make it so , ' he said , raising his head with a smile that showed his fine teeth .
She could not help smiling in answer , not to his words but to his enamoured eyes .
She took his hand and stroked with it her cold cheek and cropped hair .
'I don 't know you with this short hair !
'Yes , I feel very weak , ' she said with a smile , and her lip trembled again .
'We will go to Italy and you will soon get well , ' said he .
'Is it possible that we shall be like husband and wife , alone , a family , you and I ? ' she said , looking closely into his eyes .
'I am only surprised that it could ever have been otherwise . ' 
'Steve says he will agree to anything , but I cannot accept his generosity , ' she said dreamily , gazing past Vronsky 's face . ' I don 't want a divorce .
He was quite unable to understand how she could , at the moment of their first reunion , think about her son and divorce .
As if all that were not immaterial !
'Don 't talk and don 't think about it ' he said , playing with her hand and trying to draw her attention to himself ; but she continued to gaze past him .
'Oh , why did I not die ? It would have been best ! ' she said , the tears streaming noiselessly down her cheeks ; but unwilling to pain him , she tried to smile .
To refuse the flattering offer of a post at Tashkend , which was a dangerous one , would have seemed disgraceful and impossible according to Vronsky 's former views .
But now without a moment 's hesitation he did refuse it and , observing that his superiors frowned upon his action , at once resigned his commission .
A month later Karenin and his son were left alone in the house , and Anna went abroad with Vronsky - not only without getting a divorce but having resolutely refused it .
Leo Tolstoy
Consequently , having decided to divide her daughter 's trousseau into two parts , a lesser and a larger , the Princess eventually consented to have the wedding before Advent .
This plan would be all the more convenient because the young couple intended immediately after the wedding to go to the country , where the larger part of the trousseau would not be required .
He had not even any plans or aims for the future , but left these to others to decide , quite sure that everything would turn out splendidly .
His brother Sergius Ivanich , Oblonsky , and the Princess directed his actions .
His brother borrowed money for him , the Princess advised him to return to the country after the wedding , and Oblonsky suggested going abroad .
He agreed to everything .
'Do whatever you like , whatever pleases you !
I am happy , and my happiness cannot be made or marred by anything you do , ' he thought .
She knew that in the country Levin had work of which he was fond .
As he saw , she not only did not understand that work but did not wish to understand it .
'I say , ' Oblonsky asked Levin one day after his return from the country , where he had made all preparations for the young couple , ' have you got a certificate to show that you have received communion ? '
'Oh dear ! ' exclaimed Levin . ' I think it is nine years since I went to communion !
'You are a good one ! ' remarked Oblonsky , laughing . ' And you call me a Nihilist !
But Oblonsky arranged that too .
Levin began to prepare himself .
To him , as an agnostic who yet respected the religious beliefs of others , it was always very trying to be present at , or to take part in , any religious ceremony .
In his present state of mind , softened and sensitive to everything , to be obliged to pretend was not only trying but appeared impossible .
Now , in his state of triumph at the flowering time of his life , he was to be obliged to lie or blaspheme !
But question Oblonsky as he would , as to whether he could not obtain a certificate without going to communion , Oblonsky declared that he must go through with it .
And the priest is such a nice old man .
He will draw that tooth for you so that you will scarcely feel it . ' 
Standing in church during the first service he attended , Levin tried to revive the memories of his youth and the strong religious feeling with which at the age of sixteen or seventeen he had been imbued .
But he immediately became convinced that it was out of his power to do so .
He then tried to regard it all as a meaningless , empty custom , like making a round of calls , but felt equally unable to do that .
In matters of religion Levin , like most of his contemporaries , had very indefinite views .
He could not believe in it , and yet was not firmly convinced that it was all false .
He stood through the mass and vespers and evensong , and the next day , having got up earlier than usual , he went to church before breakfast to hear morning prayers and to confess .
No one else was in the church except a soldier @-@ beggar , two old women , and the clergy .
The young deacon , the two halves of his long back clearly distinguishable through his thin under @-@ cassock , met him , and going at once to a small table beside the wall , began reading the prayers .
'How wonderfully expressive her hand is ! ' he thought , recalling how they had sat at the corner table the day before .
He remembered how he had kissed the hand and afterwards examined the converging lines on the rosy palm .
Again ' Lordvmercypons ! ' thought he , crossing himself , bowing , and watching the movements of the bowing deacon 's flexible back .
'Well , it will soon be over now , ' he thought .
A minute later he put his head out and beckoned to Levin .
The sealed @-@ up thoughts began stirring in Levin 's head , but he hastened to drive them away .
'It will get settled somehow , ' he thought , and went to the ambo .
On going up the steps and turning to the right he saw the priest .
The latter , an old man with a thin grizzled beard and kind , weary eyes , stood beside the lectern turning over the leaves of a missal .
Bowing slightly to Levin he began at once in his stereotyped tone to read the prayers .
At the end he bowed to the ground and turned to Levin .
'I have doubted , and still doubt , everything , ' replied Levin in a voice unpleasant to himself , and stopped .
The priest paused a few seconds to see whether Levin would say anything more , and then closing his eyes said rapidly , with a strong provincial accent :
'Doubts are natural to human weakness , but we must pray that our merciful Lord will strengthen us .
What are your particular sins ? ' he continued without the slightest pause , as if anxious not to waste time .
'My chief sin is doubt .
I doubt everything and am in doubt nearly all the time . ' 
'Doubt is natural to human weakness , ' repeated the priest . ' What do you doubt in particular ? '
Sometimes I even doubt the existence of God , ' said Levin involuntarily , and was horrified at the impropriety of his words .
'What doubt can there be of the existence of God ? ' he asked with a faint smile .
'What doubt can you have of the Creator when you see His creation ? ' continued the priest in his rapid , stereotyped voice . ' Who has adorned the vault of Heaven with luminaries ?
Who has decked the earth with beauty ?
How could it all be , without a Creator ? ' he asked , with an inquiring glance at Levin .
Levin felt that it would not be proper to enter into a philosophic discussion with a priest , and therefore merely replied to the direct questions ,
'I don 't know . ' 
'Then how can you doubt that God created everything ? ' said the priest in puzzled amazement .
'I don 't understand it at all , ' said Levin , blushing , and feeling that his words were silly and that they could not but be silly .
'Pray to God and entreat Him !
Even the holy Fathers doubted and prayed God to strengthen their faith .
The devil is very powerful and we must resist him .
The priest paused awhile as if in thought .
'I hear you are about to enter into holy matrimony with the daughter of my parishioner and spiritual son , Prince Shcherbatsky ? ' he added with a smile . ' A splendid young woman ! '
'Why need he ask me that at confession ? ' he thought .
And as if in answer to the thought , the priest said :
'You are about to enter into matrimony and God may give you children , is it not so ?
Will you really say to him , " I don 't know " ?
You cannot help knowing , since God in His great mercy has revealed it to you .
Or your child may ask you , " What awaits me beyond the tomb ? "
How will you answer him ?
That is wrong ! ' The priest ceased and , with his head on one side , regarded Levin with mild kindly eyes .
When he got home that day Levin felt relieved at having done with an unpleasant episode in such a way that he had not been obliged to tell lies .
'Of course , not now , ' thought he , ' but later on . ' 
Sergius Ivanich was in the best of spirits and was tickled by Katavasov 's originality .
Katavasov , feeling that his originality was observed and appreciated , showed it off .
Chirikov gaily and good @-@ naturedly backed up every one else .
'There now ! ' said Katavasov with a drawl , a habit he had fallen into when lecturing . ' What a talented fellow our friend Constantine Dmitrich used to be !
'I have never come across a more. decided foe of marriage than yourself , ' remarked Sergius Ivanich .
'No . I am no foe of marriage , but I believe in division of labour !
Persons who can do nothing else must make men , and the others must help them to culture and happiness .
There are hosts of aspirants who aim at mixing those two professions but I am not one of them ! '
Do you know , ' said Levin turning to his brother , ' Katavasov is writing a work on nutriment and ... '
What does it matter what I write about ?
'But they would not prevent you loving a wife ! '
'Why ? '
Now you like farming sport ... Well , you just wait and see ! '
'You know , Arkhip came to @-@ day to say that in Prudnoye there are lots of elk and two bears , ' said Chirikov .
'Well , you 'll have to get them without me . ' 
'There you are ! ' said Sergius Ivanich . ' Good @-@ bye to bear @-@ hunting in future ! Your wife won 't allow it . ' 
Levin smiled .
The idea that his wife would not allow it seemed so agreeable that he was prepared to forgo the pleasure of ever setting eyes on a bear again .
'All the same , it 's a pity that those two bears will be killed without you .
Do you remember that time in Hapilovka ?
What fine sport we had ! ' said Chirikov .
Levin did not wish to deprive him of the illusion that some @-@ where there could be something good without her , therefore he said nothing .
'This custom of taking leave of celibacy is not without its reason , ' said Sergius Ivanich . ' However happy you may be , you can 't help regretting your freedom . ' 
'Now confess that you feel like the bridegroom in Gogol 's play who jumped out of the window ? ' teased Chirikov .
'Of course he feels so , but won 't own up , ' said Katavasov , and burst out laughing .
'Well , the window is open ...
Let us be off to Tver .
And leave them to do as they please here , ' said Chirikov , smiling .
'I am ready to swear I can 't find in my soul a trace of regret for my freedom , ' said Levin , with a smile .
'Ah , but your soul is in such chaos at the present moment that you are unable to find anything there ! Wait till you 've settled down a bit , then you 'll find it , ' said Katavasov .
'No , I should even now have some consciousness that despite my feelings ' ( he did not wish in Katavasov 's presence to use the word love ) ' and my happiness I was yet sorry to lose my freedom .
'Very bad !
A hopeless case ! ' said Katavasov . ' Well , let us drink to his recovery , or let us wish that at least a hundredth part of his dreams come true .
Even that will be such joy as was never seen on earth ! '
Soon after dinner the visitors left to get ready for the wedding .
When he was alone , Levin , thinking over the remarks of the three bachelors , once more asked himself whether there was in his soul any of that regret for his freedom that they had been speaking about .
The question made him smile .
Happiness consists only in loving and desiring : in wishing her wishes and in thinking her thoughts , which means having no freedom whatever ; that is happiness ! '
'But do I know her thoughts , wishes , or feelings ? ' a voice suddenly whispered .
The smile faded from his face and he pondered .
He was possessed by fear and doubt , doubt of everything .
Supposing she is only marrying me just to get married ?
Supposing she does not herself know what she is doing ? ' he asked himself . ' She might bethink herself and only when she is already married find out that she does not and never could love me ... '
And strange and most evil thoughts about her came into his mind .
He became jealous of Vronsky just as he had been the year before , as if it had been but yesterday that he saw her with him .
Suddenly he jumped up .
'No , this won 't do ! ' he said to himself despairingly . ' I will go to her and tell her for the last time that we are now free , and that perhaps we had better keep so !
Anything would be better than continual shame , misery , infidelity ! '
With his heart full of despair and bitterness toward every one , toward himself and her , he left the hotel and went to her .
She was sitting on a trunk and making some arrangements with one of the maids , sorting a pile of differently coloured dresses that hung over the backs of chairs or lay on the floor .
And I am sorting my old dresses to give them away ... '
'Ah , that is very nice ; ' he said gloomily , with a glance at the maid .
I will call you , ' said Kitty . ' What is the matter with you ? ' she asked as soon as the maid was gone .
I cannot bear it alone , ' he cried in a despairing tone , standing before her and looking imploringly into her eyes .
'I have come to say that there is still time ...
What is the matter with you ? ' ' What I have said a thousand times and cannot help thinking - that I am not worthy of you !
It cannot be that you have agreed to marry me .
You cannot love me ? ...
I ... you 'd better tell me ... ' he went on without looking at her . ' I shall be unhappy , of course .
Let them all say what they like : anything is better than the misfortune ...
'I don 't understand , ' she said , thoroughly frightened . ' Do you mean you refuse ... Why stop ... ? '
'Yes , if you don 't love me . ' 
'Are you mad ? ' she exclaimed , flushing with vexation ; but his face was so piteous that she suppressed her vexation , and throwing the dresses on a chair sat down closer to him .
'What are you thinking about ? Tell me everything . ' 
What could you love me for ? '
'O God , what can I do ... ' she cried , and began to weep .
'Oh , what have I done ! ' he exclaimed , and kneeling before her he began kissing her hands .
This seemed quite clear to him .
'How is it you don 't understand ?
I have considered it all . ' 
'She has scarcely eaten anything all these days and has grown quite plain ; and here you come and upset her with your nonsense ! ' said she . ' Be off , be off , my dear ! '
Guilty and ashamed , but comforted , Levin returned to his hotel .
His brother , Dolly , and Oblonsky , all in evening dress , were waiting to bless him with the icon .
Then a carriage had to be sent to fetch the groomsman , and another was to take Sergius Ivanich and return again .
Altogether there were many complicated arrangements to consider .
One thing was certain : there was no time to be lost , for it was already half @-@ past six .
The Blessing was not a success .
'Then this is what we must do : you go and fetch him in our carriage , and Sergius Ivanich , if he will be so kind , will go first and will send the carriage back . ' 
'Of course , I shall be very pleased ! '
'And we will follow immediately with him ...
Have your trunks been sent off ? ' inquired Oblonsky .
Those who had arrived too late to get into the middle of the throng pressed round the windows , pushing and disputing and trying to peer in between the bars .
More than twenty carriages had already been ranged along the street by the mounted police .
A police @-@ officer , unmindful of the frost , stood at the entrance looking brilliant in his blue uniform .
More carriages kept driving up , and now ladies with flowers in their hair got out , holding up their trains ; or men appeared who doffed their military caps or black hats as they entered the church .
Every time the door creaked every one turned round , expecting to see the bride and bridegroom enter .
At first they expected the bride and bridegroom to enter at any moment , and attached no importance to the delay .
Then they turned more and more often toward the door , wondering whether anything had happened .
At length the delay became awkward , and the friends and relatives tried to look as if they were not thinking about the bride and bridegroom but were absorbed in their conversations .
The archdeacon , as if to draw attention to the value of his time , coughed impatiently , making the windows vibrate .
The priest continually sent a chanter or deacon to see whether the bridegroom had arrived , and he himself , in his purple surplice with the embroidered girdle , went with increasing frequency to the side door in expectation of the bridegroom .
At last one of the ladies looked at her watch and said , ' Well , this is strange ! ' and then all the guests became restless and expressed their surprise and dissatisfaction aloud .
The best man went to find out what had occurred .
Levin meanwhile , in trousers but without coat or waistcoat , was pacing up and down his room , perpetually putting his head out at the door and glancing up the corridor .
But in the corridor there was nobody , and in despair he returned and addressed Oblonsky , who was quietly smoking .
'Was ever a man in such a terribly idiotic position ' he demanded .
'Yes , it is stupid , ' Oblonsky concurred with a soothing smile . ' But don 't worry , it will be here in a minute . ' 
'Oh , how can I help it ? ' said Levin with suppressed fury . ' And these idiotic open waistcoats - it 's impossible ! '
He glanced at his crumpled shirt @-@ front . ' And suppose the things have already gone to the station ! ' he exclaimed in despair .
The fact of the matter was that when Levin told his old servant Kuzma to get his things ready , Kuzma had duly brought his dress coat , waistcoat and what else he considered necessary .
'You 've got it on , ' Kuzma replied with a quiet smile .
The shirt Levin had been wearing since the morning was crumpled and quite unfit to wear with the fashionable low @-@ cut waistcoat .
Meantime in the church every one was waiting for the bridegroom ; while he was pacing up and down like a caged beast , looking despairingly along the corridor , remembering all he had said to Kitty and wondering what she must be thinking now .
At last the guilty Kuzma , quite out of breath , rushed in with the shirt .
'Only just in time - they were hoisting the trunk into the cart , ' he gasped .
Three minutes later Levin , not looking at the clock to avoid upsetting himself still more , ran as fast as he could down the corridor .
'That won 't help matters , ' remarked Oblonsky , smiling and following without haste . ' It will all " shape itself , " all " shape itself ' ... I assure you ! '
Oblonsky told his wife the reason of the delay , and the guests smiled and whispered to one another .
Levin saw no one and nothing ; he did not take his eyes off his bride .
Every one said she had grown plainer during the last few days , and in her bridal dress was nothing like so pretty as usual ; but Levin thought otherwise .
'I thought you meant to run away , ' she said , smiling at him .
'It was such a stupid thing that happened ! I am ashamed to tell it , ' he said with a blush , and was obliged to turn round to the approaching Sergius Ivanich .
'Nice story that , about your shirt ! ' said Sergius Ivanich with a smile and shake of the head .
'Yes , yes ! ' answered Levin , unable to understand what was being said .
'Now then , Kostya ! ' said Oblonsky , feigning consternation . ' You 've got to decide an important point , and you 're in exactly the right frame of mind to appreciate its importance .
I have been asked whether you will have new candles or used ones to hold ?
The difference is ten roubles , ' he added , puckering his lips into a smile . ' I have settled it , but perhaps you will not be satisfied . ' 
Though he knew it was a joke , Levin could not smile .
'Yes , yes ! Fresh ones . ' 
'Kitty , mind you step first upon the mat ! ' said Countess Nordston , coming up to them . ' You are a fine fellow ! ' she added , addressing Levin .
'Aren 't you frightened ? ' asked Kitty 's old aunt Mary Dmitrievna .
Wait a moment , put your head down , ' said Kitty 's sister , Princess Lvova , and raising her plump , beautiful arms she adjusted the flowers on Kitty 's head .
Dolly advanced and was about to say something , but could not speak and began crying and laughing in an unnatural manner .
The priest turned to Levin and said something that Levin did not hear .
When at last he had taken her hand properly , the priest went a few steps in front of them and halted at the lectern .
The crowd of friends and relatives , their voices buzzing and the ladies ' trains rustling , moved after them .
Some one stooped down to arrange the bride 's veil .
The church became so quiet that the drops of wax were heard falling from the candles .
Oblonsky stepped up cautiously , whispered something to him , made a sign to Levin , and stepped back again .
The priest lit two wax candles decorated with flowers , and holding them askew in his left hand so that the wax kept slowly dripping , turned to the young couple .
It was the same priest who had heard Levin 's confession .
Then he gave them the candles , took the censer , and slowly stepped away from them .
'Is it really true ? ' thought Levin , and glanced round at his bride .
He could see her profile slightly from above , and by the just perceptible movements of her lips and eyelashes he knew she was aware of his look .
She did not turn , but her high frilled collar moved , rising to her pink little ear .
He saw that a sigh had been suppressed within her breast and that the little hand in its long glove holding the candle trembled .
All the worry about his shirt , his lateness , the conversation of their relatives , their displeasure and his ridiculous mishap , suddenly vanished from his mind and he felt happy though scared .
The handsome , tall senior deacon in a silver cloth alb , his curled hair parted down the middle , came briskly forward lifting his stole with a practised movement of two fingers , and stopped opposite the priest .
'Bless us , Lord ! ' slowly succeeding one another , and vibratingly resonant , came the solemn tones .
'Blessed be our God , now and hereafter , for ever and ever ! ' replied the old priest meekly , in a sing @-@ song voice , continuing to turn something over on the lectern .
Then , harmoniously filling the whole church from windows to vaulted roof , a full chord sung by the invisible choir rose , swelled , hung for a moment , and softly died away .
There were prayers as usual for the world above , for salvation , for the Synod , for the Emperor , and also for the servants of God that day wedded , Constantine and Catherine .
'Let us pray to the Lord that He may send them perfect love , peace , and help ! ' the whole church seemed to breathe with the senior deacon 's voice .
'How did they find out that it is help , exactly help that I need ? ' he wondered , remembering his late fears and doubts .
'What do I know ? What can I do in this awful matter without help ?
Help is exactly what I need now ! '
Looking round he met her eyes .
From the expression in them he concluded that she understood them as he did ; but this was not so .
She understood hardly anything of the service and was not even listening to the words of the ceremony .
She could neither listen nor understand , so deep was the one feeling that filled her soul and became ever stronger and stronger .
It was a feeling of joy at the fruition of what had been for the last month and a half going on in her soul , of that which for those six weeks had gladdened and tortured her .
At one moment she was horrified at this indifference , and the next moment rejoiced at that which caused her indifference .
She could not think of or desire anything but life with this man ; but , as that life had not yet begun , she could not even clearly picture it to herself .
There was only anticipation , fear , and joy at something new and unknown ; and now at any moment the anticipation and uncertainty , and the remorse at repudiating her former life , would all come to an end and something new would begin .
Again turning to the reading @-@ desk the priest with some difficulty picked up Kitty 's little ring , and asking Levin for his hand put the ring on the tip of his finger .
Several times the couple tried to guess what was expected of them , and blundered each time , the priest prompting them in whispers .
Dolly , Chirikov , and Oblonsky came forward to help them .
He felt that any kind of smile would hurt their feelings .
ALL Moscow , including both relatives and friends , had congregated in the church .
In the circle nearest the bride were her two sisters , Dolly the elder and the calm and beautiful Princess Lvova , who had come from abroad .
'Why is Marie in lilac ? It 's almost as unsuitable at a wedding as black , ' remarked Mrs. Korsunskaya .
'With her complexion it 's her only salvation , ' replied Princess Drubetskaya . ' I wonder they are having the wedding in the evening , like tradespeople . ' 
I was married in the evening too , ' answered Mrs. Korsunskaya , and sighed as she remembered how sweet she had looked that day , how funnily enamoured her husband then was , and how different things were now .
She answered only with a smile .
She was looking at Kitty and thinking of the time when she would be standing there beside Count Sinyavin , just as Kitty now stood , and how she would then remind him of his joke .
Young Shcherbatsky told the old Maid of Honour Nikolayeva that he intended to put the crown on Kitty 's chignon , to make her happy .
Koznyshev was talking to Dolly , jokingly assuring her that the custom of going away after the wedding was spreading because newly @-@ married couples always felt rather uncomfortable .
'Your brother has a right to feel proud .
'I am past all that , Darya Alexandrovna , ' he answered , and his face became unexpectedly sad and serious .
'I must put her wreath straight , ' she replied , without listening .
'What a pity she has grown so much plainer ! ' remarked Countess Nordston to the Princess Lvova . ' All the same he is not worth her little finger .
'No , I like him very much , and not just because he will be my brother @-@ in @-@ law , ' answered the Princess . ' How well he behaves !
And it is so difficult to behave well under these circumstances , and not be ridiculous - and he is not ridiculous or stiff , and is evidently touched . ' 
'I suppose you quite expected this ? '
'Well , let us see which of them will step first on the mat !
'It does not matter , ' replied Princess Lvova . ' We are all submissive wives , it is in our nature . ' 
'Well , I stepped on the mat before Vasily !
And you , Dolly ? '
Dolly , who was standing near , heard , but did not reply .
Her eyes were moist and she could not have spoken without bursting into tears .
She rejoiced at the sight of Kitty and Levin , but going back to the past she thought of her own wedding , kept glancing at the beaming Oblonsky , and , forgetting the present , recollected nothing but her own young and innocent love .
She too had once stood with veiled head , pure and crowned with orange blossom .
'And now ? How strange ! ' she murmured .
'And is that her sister in white satin ? ...
Now hear how the deacon will roar , " Wives , obey your husbands " ! '
'I asked the footman .
'There now , Mary Vasilyevna ! You were maintaining that crinolines were being worn fuller at the back !
Just look at that one in the puce dress - an ambassador 's wife , they say .
'What a darling the bride is , like a lamb decked for the slaughter !
So chattered the crowd of women who had managed to get inside the church .
After the usual questions of whether they wished to be married and whether they had promised themselves to others , and their answers , which sounded strange to themselves , the second part of the service began .
Kitty listened to the words of the prayer , trying to comprehend their meaning but unable to do so .
Triumph and radiant joy filled her heart more and more as the ceremony proceeded , and made it impossible for her to be attentive .
They prayed : ' That they may live in chastity for the good of the fruits of the womb , and find joy in their sons and daughters . ' 
'It is all very beautiful , ' thought Kitty as she heard these words , ' and could not be different . ' And a smile of joy , which involuntarily communicated itself to all who regarded her , shone on her radiant face .
'Put it quite on ! ' came the words of advice when the priest had put crowns on their heads and Shcherbatsky , his hand in its three @-@ buttoned glove trembling , held the crown high above Kitty 's head .
'Put it on , ' she whispered , smiling .
Levin glanced round at her , was struck by the joyous radiance of her face , and was involuntarily infected by her feeling .
He felt bright and joyous as she did .
With light hearts they heard the Epistle read and the roll of the senior deacon 's voice in the last verse , for which the outsiders present had been waiting impatiently .
Young Shcherbatsky and Chirikov , who were supporting the crowns and getting entangled in the bride 's train , smiled too and were pleased without knowing why , when they chanced to lag behind or jostle the young couple if the priest happened to stop .
The spark of joy that was glowing in Kitty 's heart seemed to have spread to every one in the church .
Levin fancied that the priest and deacon wanted to smile just as he did .
Having lifted the crowns from their heads , the priest read the last prayer and congratulated the married couple .
Levin glanced at Kitty and thought he had never seen her like that before , so enchanting with the new light of happiness irradiating her face .
He wished to speak to her , but did not know whether it was all over yet .
The priest helped him out of the difficulty , saying softly , with a smile on his kindly mouth , ' Kiss your wife ; and you , kiss your husband ! ' He took the candles from their hands .
Levin kissed her carefully on her smiling lips , offered his arm , and with a feeling of strange closeness led her out of the church .
He could not believe it was all true and only realized it when their surprised and timid glances met and he felt that they were already one .
After supper that same night the young couple left for the country .
VRONSKY AND ANNA HAD ALREADY BEEN TRAVELLING together in Europe for three months .
They had visited Venice , Rome , and Naples , and had only just reached a small Italian town where they meant to make a longer stay .
The steward was ready to sign the contract .
'Ah , I am very glad , ' said Vronsky . ' And is the lady in ? '
'The lady has been for a walk , but has now returned , ' replied the waiter .
Vronsky took off his soft , broad @-@ brimmed hat and wiped his perspiring forehead and his hair , which he had allowed to grow half @-@ way down his ears and wore brushed back so as to hide his bald patch .
After an absent @-@ minded glance at the man who was still standing there watching him , he was about to go in .
'This gentleman is a Russian and was asking about you , ' said the head @-@ waiter .
It was really Golenishchev , his fellow @-@ student in the Corps des Pages .
In the Corps Golenishchev had been a Liberal , had left the Corps a civilian , and had never served .
On leaving the Corps the two friends had separated and had met but once since then .
On that occasion Vronsky found that Golenishchev had chosen some high @-@ flown Liberal activity and therefore felt he must despise Vronsky 's profession and activities .
And Golenishchev had remained contemptuously indifferent to Vronsky 's attitude , so that that meeting ought to have separated them still further .
Yet now they brightened up and exclaimed with pleasure at recognizing one another .
Vronsky would never have thought he could be so pleased to see Golenishchev , but probably he was himself unaware how bored he was .
A similar expression of pleasure replaced the former anxious look on Golenishchev 's face .
'How pleased I am to see you ! ' said Vronsky , a friendly smile disclosing his fine white teeth .
'I heard the name of Vronsky but I did not know which Vronsky .
'Come in !
Well , and what are you doing ? '
'Oh , I have been here over a year .
'Ah ! ' said Vronsky in an interested tone . ' Well , come in . ' 
And according to the usual way with Russians , instead of saying what he wanted to hide from the servants in Russian , he began speaking French .
'You know Madame Karenina ?
We are travelling together .
I am now going to her , ' he said in French , attentively watching Golenishchev 's expression .
Three days , ' answered Vronsky , still attentively scrutinizing his friend 's face .
'Yes , he is a decent fellow and looks at the matter in the right way , ' said Vronsky to himself , understanding the meaning of the other 's look and the change of subject . ' I can introduce him to Anna , as he sees the matter rightly . ' 
But had he , and those who understood the matter in the ' right ' way , been asked what this understanding amounted to , they would have been much puzzled how to reply .
They pretended to understand completely the significance and meaning of the situation , to countenance and even approve of it , but to consider it out of place and unnecessary to explain all this .
Evidently he avoided , without the least effort , everything in conversation that might have sounded awkward .
He had never met Anna before and was struck by her beauty , and still more by the simplicity with which she accepted her position .
She blushed when Vronsky showed Golenishchev in , and the childlike flush that suffused her open and handsome face pleased him exceedingly .
This straightforward and simple attitude toward her own position pleased Golenishchev .
Noticing Anna 's good @-@ natured , bright , and energetic manner , he thought that , knowing both Karenin and Vronsky as he did , he quite understood her .
'It is mentioned in the guide @-@ book , ' said Golenishchev , referring to the palazzo Vronsky was taking .
'I say , the weather is glorious : let us go and have another look at it , ' said Vronsky to Anna .
'I should like to very much .
I 'll just go and put on my hat . You say it 's hot ' she asked , stopping at the door and looking inquiringly at Vronsky , while a bright flush again suffused her face .
From her look Vronsky understood that she did not yet know what attitude he wished to adopt toward Golenishchev , and was afraid she might not have behaved suitably .
He answered with a long and tender look .
'No , not very hot , ' he said .
She thought she had understood him completely and above all that he was satisfied with her . She gave him a smile and went out with rapid steps .
'Well , and so you have settled down here ? ' said Vronsky in order to begin a conversation .
'You are still busy at the same thing ? ' he went on , recollecting that he had heard the other was writing something .
'Yes , I am writing the second part of Two Principles , ' said Golenishchev , flushing with pleasure at the question . ' To be quite exact , I mean , I am not yet writing , but am collecting the materials .
We in Russia are slow to realize that we are the inheritors of Byzantium , ' and he began a long and heated explanation .
At first Vronsky felt uncomfortable because he did not know even the first part of Two Principles , which the author mentioned as if it were well known .
But later on , when Golenishchev began expounding his view , and Vronsky was able to follow him , even though he was ignorant of Two Principles he listened with interest , for the man talked well .
Yet Vronsky was surprised at , and sorry to see , the irritable excitement with which Golenishchev spoke on the subject that interested him .
The longer he talked the more his eyes flashed , the more hastily he retorted on imaginary opponents , and the more agitated and offended became his face .
Remembering him as a thin , active , good @-@ natured , and noble boy , always at the head of his class , Vronsky could not understand the cause of the agitation , nor approve of it .
What most displeased him was that Golenishchev , a man belonging to good Society , should put himself an the same level with certain scribblers who irritated him and made him angry .
Was it worth while ?
He did not like this , but nevertheless he felt that Golenishchev was not happy and he was sorry for him .
After trying several topics of conversation she led him on to the subject of art , about which he talked very well , and listened to him with attention .
'I am very pleased about one thing , ' said Anna to Golenishchev when they had returned to the hotel . ' Alexis will have a nice studio .
'Do you paint ? ' inquired Golenishchev , turning quickly to Vronsky .
'Yes , I went in for it long ago , and now have begun a little , ' answered Vronsky with a blush .
DURING THIS , THE FIRST PERIOD of her freedom and rapid recovery , Anna was unpardonably happy and full of the joy of life .
On the one hand this memory was too terrible to dwell upon , and on the other hand her husband 's misfortune had meant for her too great a joy for repentance to be possible .
The memory of the evil done to her husband aroused in her a feeling akin to repulsion , such as a man might feel who when in danger of drowning had shaken off another who clung to him .
That other was drowned ; of course it was wrong , but it had been the only way of escape and it was better not to recall such terrible details .
One comforting reflection about her conduct had come to her in the first moment of the rupture , and when she now remembered the past she also recalled that reflection .
But sincerely as Anna desired to suffer , she was not suffering .
She was not conscious of degradation .
The parting from her son , whom she loved , did not trouble her at first either .
The little girl , his child , was so sweet , and Anna had grown so attached to her since she was the only child left to her , that she rarely thought of her son .
The desire to live , enhanced by her recovery , was so powerful , and the conditions of her life were so novel and pleasant , that Anna felt unpardonably happy .
The better she knew Vronsky the more she loved him .
She loved him both for his own sake and for his love of her .
To possess him entirely was a continual joy to her .
His nearness was always pleasant .
All the traits of character , with which she became better and better acquainted , seemed inexpressibly delightful .
His appearance , altered by civilian dress , was as attractive to her as to a girl in love .
In all he said , thought , or did , she saw something peculiarly noble and exalted .
She dared not let him see her consciousness of her own inferiority .
To her it seemed that if he knew of it he would the sooner cease to love her , and there was nothing she now feared more - though she had no reason to do so - than the loss of his love .
But she could not help being grateful to him for his treatment of her , and showing him how much she valued it .
He was even more lovingly respectful to her than before , and the thought that she must never be allowed to feel the awkwardness of her situation never left his mind for a moment .
He , so virile a man , not only never contradicted her , but where she was concerned seemed to have no will of his own and to be only occupied in anticipating her every wish .
She could not help appreciating this , although his strained attentiveness , the atmosphere of solicitude with which he surrounded her , became burdensome at times .
Vronsky meanwhile , in spite of the complete fulfilment of what he had so long desired , was not completely happy .
He soon felt that the realization of his longing gave him only one grain of the mountain of bliss he had anticipated .
That realization showed him the eternal error men make by imagining that happiness consists in the gratification of their wishes .
Soon he felt rising in his soul a desire for desires - boredom .
Involuntarily he began to snatch at every passing caprice , mistaking it for a desire and a purpose .
Sixteen hours daily had to be filled somehow , living abroad as they did completely at liberty , quite cut off from the round of social life that had filled his time in Petersburg .
Intercourse with local Society or with the Russians was , in consequence of the indefiniteness of their relation , likewise impossible .
Sight @-@ seeing , apart from the fact that he had already seen everything , had for him - a Russian and an intelligent man - none of that inexplicable importance the English manage to attach to it .
As a hungry animal seizes every object it meets , hoping to find food in it , so Vronsky unconsciously seized now on politics , now on new books , now on pictures .
The role Vronsky had chosen , with their removal to the palazzo , was quite successful ; and having through Golenishchev made the acquaintance of several interesting persons , he felt tranquil for a time .
He painted studies from nature under the direction of an Italian professor , and studied Italian life in the Middle Ages .
Mediaeval Italian life had at that time become so fascinating to him that he even began to wear his hat and throw his cloak across his shoulder in a mediaeval manner which was very becoming to him .
The article reproached the Government and the Academy for leaving a remarkable artist without encouragement or help .
'I have , ' answered Golenishchev . ' Of course he is not without talent , but his tendency is quite a false one .
He has that Ivanov @-@ Strauss @-@ Renan attitude toward Christ 's and religious art . ' 
Led on by this question about the subject of the picture to one of his favourite topics , he began to explain .
'I can 't understand how one can make so gross an error !
They choose the one person who must not be chosen as a subject for art , and then ... '
Have you seen his portrait of Vasilchikova ?
But it seems he does not want to paint any more portraits , so it is possible he may be in want .
I say that ... '
'Couldn 't one ask him to paint Anna Arkadyevna 's portrait ? ' said Vronsky .
'Why mine ? ' said Anna . ' After the one you painted I want no other .
'There she is ! ' she added , looking from the window at the beautiful Italian nurse who had taken the baby into the garden , and then immediately glancing round at Vronsky .
The beautiful nurse , whose head Vronsky was painting for his picture , was the only and secret sorrow of Anna 's life .
Vronsky painted her , admired her beauty and her ' mediaevalness , ' and Anna dared not confess to herself that she was afraid of being jealous of the nurse ; so she treated the woman with special kindness and spoilt her and her little son .
Vronsky too looked out of the window and into Anna 's eyes , and at once turned to Golenishchev saying :
'I have met him .
But he is a crank and quite uneducated .
You know , he is one of those heathenish new folk one so often meets nowadays ; you know ! One of those freethinkers who have been brought up from the beginning in disbelief , negation , and materialism .
He is one of these .
He is the son of a head footman , I think , and has had no education .
When he entered the Academy and won a reputation for himself he , not being stupid , wanted to get same education .
So he resorted to what seemed to him to be the wellspring of education - the magazines .
But among us at the present day he tumbled straight into the literature of negation and rapidly assimilated the essence of the negative teaching , and there he was !
In my article I ... '
Golenishchev pulled himself up and unwillingly agreed , but as the artist lived in a distant part of the town they decided to hire a carriage .
An hour later Anna , seated beside Golenishchev with Vronsky facing them , drove to a new ugly house in a distant quarter of the town .
MIKHAYLOV , THE ARTIST , WAS AT WORK as usual when Vronsky 's and Golenishchev 's cards were brought him .
Every morning he worked in the studio at his big picture .
On returning home he had been angry with his wife because she had not managed to pacify the landlady , who clamoured for the rent .
'Have I not told you scores of times not to enter upon discussions ?
At best you are only a fool , and when you begin arguing in Italian you become a treble fool ! ' he said at the end of a long dispute .
'Then you shouldn 't get into arrears !
'Shut up , for heaven 's sake ! ' cried Mikhaylov with tears in his voice , stopping his ears with his hands as he went into his workroom behind a partition and locked the door behind him .
'What a duffer ! ' he muttered to himself as he seated himself at the table , and having opened a portfolio he at once set to work with particular ardour at an unfinished drawing .
He never worked with such ardour or so successfully as when things were going badly with him , and especially after a quarrel with his wife .
'Oh dear ! If only I could escape somewhere ! ' he thought as he worked .
He was sketching the figure of a man in a fit of anger .
He had sketched him before , but had been dissatisfied with the result .
'No , the other one was better ...
He went back to his wife , and frowning , without looking at her , asked his eldest little girl where the paper was that he had given them .
Nevertheless , he took it , put it on his table , and , stepping backward and screwing up his eyes , began examining it .
Suddenly he smiled and flung up his arms joyfully .
'That 's it ! That 's it ! ' he said , and taking up his pencil he began drawing rapidly .
He copied that new pose , and , suddenly remembering the energetic pose and prominent chin of a shopman from whom he had bought cigars , he gave the figure that man 's face and chin .
He laughed with joy , for the inanimate , unnatural figure had become alive , and was just the thing .
The figure was alive , clear , and well @-@ defined .
But while making these corrections he did not alter the pose but only removed what interfered with its character .
'Directly ! Directly ! '
He went out to his wife .
'Come , Sasha , don 't he angry , ' he said , smiling timidly and tenderly . ' You were wrong and so was I. I 'll settle it all ! '
Having made it up with his wife he put on an olive @-@ green overcoat with a velvet collar , and a hat , and went to the studio .
His successful drawing was already forgotten .
Now he was pleased and excited by the visit to his studio of these grand Russians who had come in a carriage .
About his picture - the one at present on the easel - he had at the bottom of his heart a firm opinion : that no one had ever painted anything like it .
He did not consider his picture better than all Raphael 's , but he knew that what he wanted to express in that picture had never yet been expressed by anyone .
Every remark , even the most trivial , which showed that those who judged it saw even but a small part of what he himself saw in it , moved him deeply .
The visitors , already disenchanted by Golenishchev 's account of the artist , were still further disillusioned by his appearance .
'Come in , please ! ' he said , trying to put on an air of indifference , as he entered the hall and took a key from his pocket to unlock the door .
ON ENTERING HIS STUDIO the artist again cast a glance at his visitors and took note of Vronsky 's face , especially his jaw .
A mass of hair and a very open forehead gave a superficial significance to that face , which had an insignificant childish , restless expression concentrated in the narrow bridge of the nose .
Vronsky and Anna , according to Mikhaylov 's conception , were in all probability distinguished wealthy Russians , who like all these wealthy Russians comprehended nothing of art but pretended to be amateurs and critics .
'There ! ' he said , stepping aside with his loose gait , and pointing to the picture .
'This is Pilate 's Admonition - Matthew , chapter xxvii . , ' he went on , conscious that his lips were beginning to tremble with excitement ; and he stepped behind the visitors .
During the few moments that they were silently gazing at it , Mikhaylov also regarded it with the indifferent eye of a stranger .
In those few moments he believed in advance that the highest and justest of criticisms was going to be pronounced by these very visitors whom he had so despised a moment before .
He saw in the foreground Pilate 's vexed face and Christ 's calm one , and behind them the faces of Pilate 's servants and of John , watching what was taking place .
He saw a well @-@ painted - and not even that , for he detected a multitude of errors - repetition of those innumerable Christs : Titian 's , Raphael 's , Rubens 's , with the same warriors and the same Pilates .
It was trivial , poor , old , and even badly painted , weak and lacking harmony .
They would be in the right when they began to say falsely @-@ polite things in the presence of the artist , and to pity and laugh at him behind his back .
The silence grew too unbearable , though it had not lasted more than a minute .
To break it and to appear calm , he made an effort and addressed Golenishchev .
'I think I have had the pleasure of meeting you ? ' he said , glancing uneasily now at Anna and now at Vronsky , in order not to lose any detail of their expressions .
Noticing , however , that Mikhaylov was waiting to hear his criticism of the picture , he said :
'Your picture has progressed very much since I last saw it , and now , as then , I am specially struck by the figure of Pilate .
One can so well understand that man , a kind , first @-@ rate fellow , but an official to his very backbone , who does not know what he is doing .
The whole of Mikhaylov 's mobile face suddenly lighted up .
His eyes brightened . He wanted to speak but was too agitated , and pretended to cough instead .
The fact that this opinion was but one of a million of other opinions which - as Mikhaylov well knew - would all have been just did not for him detract from the importance of Golenishchev 's remark .
He took a liking for Golenishchev because of that remark , and his depression changed suddenly into delight .
In an instant his whole picture became alive before his eyes , with the inexpressible complexity of everything that lives .
He wished to say that it was just so that he understood Pilate , but his trembling lips would not obey him and he was unable to speak .
Mikhaylov thought that on them too the picture had created an impression , and went up to them .
'How wonderful Christ 's expression is ! ' said Anna .
This too was one of a million just remarks which might have been made with reference to his picture and the figure of Christ .
In Christ 's expression there should be pity because there was love in it , a peace not of this world , a readiness for death , and a knowledge of the vanity of words .
Of course there was an official expression in Pilate 's face and pity in Christ 's , for the former was the embodiment of carnal and the latter of spiritual life .
All this and much more floated through Mikhaylov 's mind ; and again his face shone with ecstasy .
'Yes , and how well that figure is done , and what an atmosphere there is !
One could walk round it , ' said Golenishchev , showing evidently by this remark that he did not approve of the content and idea of the figure .
'Yes , it is wonderfully masterly ! How those figures in the background stand out !
That is technique , ' said Vronsky , addressing Golenishchev and alluding to a conversation they had had about Vronsky 's despair of attaining technical mastery .
'Yes , yes , wonderful ! ' chimed in Golenishchev and Anna .
In spite of his elation , this remark about technique grated painfully on Mikhaylov 's heart , and , glancing angrily at Vronsky , he suddenly frowned .
He often heard the word technique mentioned , and did not at all understand what was meant by it .
He knew it meant a mechanical capacity to paint and draw , quite independent of the subject @-@ matter .
He had often noticed - as now when his picture was being praised - that technique was contrasted with inner quality , as if it were possible to paint well something that was bad .
If the things he saw had been revealed to a little child , or to his cook , they would have been able to remove the outer shell from their idea .
And the most experienced and technical painter could never paint anything by means of mechanical skill alone , if the outline of the subject @-@ matter did not first reveal itself to his mind .
Moreover , he saw that if technique were spoken of , then he could not be praised for it .
And in almost all the figures and faces he saw traces of wrappings that had not been entirely removed and that spoilt the picture .
'One thing might be said , if you will allow me to make the remark , ' began Golenishchev .
'Oh , I shall be very pleased : pray do ! ' said Mikhaylov with a feigned smile .
'It is , that you have made Him a man @-@ God , and not a God @-@ man .
However , I know that you wished to do so . ' 
'I could not paint a Christ whom I had not in my soul , ' Mikhaylov rejoined gloomily .
'Yes , but in that case , if I may say what I think ...
Your picture is so good that a remark of mine cannot do it any harm , besides which it 's only my personal opinion ... yours is different , the idea itself is different .
But let us take Ivanov , for example .
I consider that if Christ is to be brought down to the level of an historic figure , it would be better to choose another historic theme , a fresh one as yet untouched . ' 
'But if this is the highest theme open to art ? '
'Other themes can be found if one looks for them .
But the fact is , art won 't stand discussion and argument .
Yet Ivanov 's picture suggests both to a believer and an unbeliever the question : Is this a God or not a God ? And the unity of impression is destroyed . ' 
To me it seems that for educated people such questions can no longer exist , ' said Mikhaylov .
Golenishchev did not agree with this , and keeping to his first contention that unity of impression is indispensable in art , he confuted Mikhaylov .
The artist was perturbed , but could find nothing to say in defence of his opinion .
ANNA AND VRONSKY HAD LONG BEEN exchanging glances regretting their friend 's clever loquacity , and at last Vronsky without waiting for his host crossed the room to look at another and smaller picture .
'Oh , how charming ! How charming !
Charming ! ' he and Anna began both at once .
'What is it they like so much ? ' wondered Mikhaylov He had forgotten all about that picture , painted three years before .
He had forgotten all the sufferings and raptures he had gone through on account of that work , when it alone had occupied him unremittingly day and night for three months . He had forgotten it , as he forgot all his finished pictures .
He did not even like looking at it , and had only brought it out because he was expecting an Englishman who wished to buy it .
'That 's nothing - only an old study , ' he said .
'How good ! ' remarked Golenishchev , evidently sincerely impressed by the charm of the picture .
It represented two boys angling in the shade of a willow .
What was he thinking about ?
But Vronsky inquired whether this picture was for sale .
To Mikhaylov , in his excitement over their visit , this mention of money matters was very disagreeable .
'It is put out for sale , ' he replied , frowning darkly .
When the visitors had left , Mikhaylov sat down before his picture of Pilate and Christ and mentally reviewed all that had been said , and even what was not said but only hinted by the visitors .
Strange to say , what had had weight with him while they were there and he looked at things from their point of view suddenly lost all significance now .
The foreshortening of Christ 's foot was , however , not right .
He took his palette and commenced working .
While correcting the foot he kept glancing at the figure of John in the background , which the visitors had not even remarked , but which he knew to be the height of perfection .
When he had completed the foot he was about to do something to that figure , but felt that he was too agitated .
He could work neither when he was too indifferent nor when he was too highly roused and saw everything too distinctly .
There was only one stage between calmness and inspiration , at which work was possible , and to @-@ day he was too excited .
He was about to cover his picture , but paused , and holding up the sheet stood a long time with a rapturous smile gazing at the figure of John .
At length , tearing himself away from it regretfully , he let the sheet fall over the picture and went home , tired but happy .
Vronsky , Anna , and Golenishchev were particularly animated and high @-@ spirited on their way back .
They talked about Mikhaylov and his pictures .
They said that it was impossible to deny his talent , but that his talent could not develop because of his lack of education - the common misfortune of our Russian artists .
But the picture of the boys had gripped their memories and they kept coming back to it . ' How charming !
How well he has hit it off , and how simply !
He does not even understand how good it is .
Yes , we must not miss the opportunity of purchasing it , ' Vronsky declared .
MIKHAYLOV SOLD VRONSKY THE PICTURE and consented to paint Anna 's portrait .
On the appointed day he came and began working .
After the fifth sitting the portrait struck every one not only by its likeness but also by its beauty .
It was strange that Mikhaylov had been able to discover that special beauty .
'One needed to know and love her as I love her , to find just that sweetest spiritual expression of hers , ' thought Vronsky , though he himself had only learnt to know that ' sweetest spiritual expression ' through the portrait .
But the expression was so true that it seemed both to him and to others that they had always known it .
'How long have I been struggling without accomplishing anything ? ' he said , referring to the portrait he was painting ; ' and he just looked , and painted this !
'That will come in good time , ' said Golenishchev , consolingly . In his opinion Vronsky had talent , and especially the education that gives a lofty outlook on art .
Golenishchev 's conviction that Vronsky possessed talent was supported by the fact that he required Vronsky 's sympathy and praise for his articles and ideas , and felt that praise and encouragement should be mutual .
In another man 's house , and particularly in Vronsky 's palazzo , Mikhaylov was quite a different man from what he was in his studio .
He was unpleasantly deferential , as if fearful of intimacy with persons whom he did not respect .
He addressed Vronsky as ' Your Excellency , ' and never stayed to dinner , though Anna and Vronsky both invited him , and he never came except for a sitting .
Anna was even kinder to him than to others , and was grateful for her portrait .
Vronsky was more than polite to him , and was evidently interested in the artist 's opinion of his ( Vronsky 's ) picture .
Golenishchev never missed an opportunity to instil into Mikhaylov a true understanding of art .
But the latter remained equally cold toward them all .
Anna felt by his look that he liked looking at her , but he avoided conversation with her .
When Vronsky talked about his art Mikhaylov remained stubbornly silent , and as stubbornly silent when they showed him Vronsky 's picture , and he was evidently oppressed by Golenishchev 's discourses , to which he made no rejoinder .
Golenishchev was the first to express the thought that was in all their minds , namely , that Mikhaylov was simply jealous of Vronsky .
Especially , there is the education which he lacks . ' 
Vronsky took Mikhaylov 's part , but in the depth of his heart he believed what Golenishchev said , for he considered that a man of that other and lower world must envy him .
Anna 's portrait , the same subject painted from nature by both of them , should have shown him the difference between Mikhaylov and himself ; but Vronsky did not see it .
He merely left off painting Anna , deciding that it would be superfluous now .
He went on , however , with his mediaeval picture .
And he , as well as Golenishchev , and especially Anna , thought it very good because it resembled famous pictures much more than Mikhaylov 's did .
He knew it was not possible to forbid Vronsky to trifle with art , knew that he and all the dilettanti had a perfect right to paint what they liked - but to him it was unpleasant .
One cannot forbid a man 's making a big wax doll and kissing it .
But if the man came and sat down with his doll in front of a lover , and began to caress it as the lover caresses his beloved , it would displease the lover .
It was this kind of unpleasantness that Mikhaylov experienced when he saw Vronsky 's pictures : he was amused , vexed , sorry , and hurt .
He had sufficient taste for art to be unable to finish his picture .
He ceased painting it because he was dimly conscious that its defects , little noticeable at first , would become striking if he went on .
The same thing happened to him as to Golenishchev , who , feeling that he had nothing to express , continually deceived himself by saying that his thought had not yet ripened and that he was bringing it to maturity and preparing materials .
But Golenishchev was embittered and tormented by it , while Vronsky could not deceive and torment himself , and above all could not become embittered .
With characteristic firmness he left off painting , without any explanations or excuses .
So they decided to return to Russia and live in the country .
In Petersburg Vronsky planned to separate his property from his brother 's , and Anna to see her son .
The summer they intended to spend on Vronsky 's large family estate .
LEVIN HAD BEEN MARRIED THREE MONTHS .
He was happy , but in quite a different way from what he had expected .
At every step he met disillusionments in his old fancies and new and unexpected enchantments .
He was happy , but having embarked on family life he saw at every step that it was not at all what he had anticipated .
At every step he took he felt as a man would feel who , after admiring the smooth happy motion of a little boat upon the water , had himself got into the boat .
As a bachelor seeing the married life of others - their petty cares , their disputes , their jealousies - he used mentally to smile contemptuously .
Levin saw that the arrangement of all those trifles was not at all so easy as he had formerly supposed .
He should , he thought , do his work , and rest from it in the joys of love .
She should be loved - and that was all .
He had been pained by it then , and now was repeatedly pained by her petty cares .
But he saw that this was necessary to her , and , loving her , though he could not understand what it was all about , and laughed at her worries , he could not help admiring them .
It struck him as very charming , but strange , and he thought it would have been better without all that .
She looked forward joyfully to Dolly 's coming with the children , especially because she meant to give each of them their favourite puddings , and because Dolly would appreciate her new arrangements .
Instinctively feeling the approach of spring , and knowing that there would be wet weather , she built her nest as she could , hastening to build it while yet learning how to do it .
This first quarrel arose because Levin had ridden over to see his new farm and returned half an hour late , having attempted a short cut home and lost his way .
He rode home thinking only of her , of her love and of his happiness , and the nearer he came the warmer grew his tenderness for her .
He tried to kiss her but she pushed him away .
'What 's the matter ? '
'You seem merry ... ' she began , wishing to say something calmly stinging .
But directly she opened her mouth , words of reproach , senseless jealousy , and everything else that had been torturing her during the half @-@ hour she had sat motionless waiting at the window , burst from her .
He understood this by a tormenting sensation of cleavage which he experienced at that moment .
Far an instant he was offended , but immediately knew he could not be offended with her because she was himself .
Never again did he feel this so strongly as this first time , and for a long time he could not recover his balance .
His natural feelings prompted him to justify himself and prove that she was in the wrong ; but to prove her in the wrong would mean irritating her still more , and widening the breach which was the cause of all the trouble .
To remain under so unjust an accusation was painful , but to justify himself and hurt her would be still worse .
Like a man half @-@ asleep and oppressed with pain , he wanted to tear off the aching part and cast it from him , but found on waking that the aching part was - himself .
All he could do was to try to soothe the ache and endure it , and this he did .
Having realized that she was in the wrong , though she did not acknowledge it , she became more tender to him , and they enjoyed a new and doubled happiness in their love .
But this did not prevent such collisions recurring quite frequently , and on very unexpected and trivial provocation .
These collisions were often caused by each not realizing what was important to the other , and also by the fact that in those early days they were often in low spirits .
However , when both were in good spirits their happiness was doubled - and yet the early days of their married life were very trying .
All that time they were conscious of peculiar strain , as if the chain that bound them were being pulled first one way and then the other .
They both tried in after life to efface from their memories all the ugly shameful circumstances of this unhealthy time during which they were rarely in a normal state and rarely themselves .
Only in the third month of their married life , after returning from Moscow where they had spent a month , did their life begin to run more smoothly .
THEY HAD JUST RETURNED FROM MOSCOW arid were glad of the solitude .
He was in his study and sat at the table writing .
As he sat thinking and writing he was all the while blissfully conscious of her presence .
He went on with his work with a feeling that the centre of gravity of his attention had shifted , and that he consequently saw the matter differently and with greater clearness .
Formerly this work had been his salvation from life .
He used to feel that without it life would be too dismal , and now he needed it in order that his life should not be too monotonously bright .
Having set to work again on his manuscript and read over what he had written , he was glad to find , that the work seemed worth doing .
Many of his former thoughts now appeared superfluous and extreme , but many omissions became clear to him when he went over the matter afresh .
He was writing a fresh chapter on why agriculture was not profitable in Russia .
While he was writing his thoughts , she was thinking about his unnatural attention to young Prince Charsky , who had been very tactlessly paying court to her on the day before their departure from Moscow .
'Why , he 's jealous ! ' she thought . ' Oh dear !
I want it ! Well ! ' and she opened her eyes wider , trying thereby to increase the force of her look .
'Yes , they divert all the sap , they produce a false glamour , ' he muttered , pausing , and feeling that she was looking at him he turned round smiling .
'Well ? ' he asked with a smile , and rose .
'Nothing , I only wanted to make you turn round , ' said she , gazing at him and trying to discover whether he was vexed at the interruption .
For me , I mean ... ' he said , coming toward her with a beaming smile of happiness .
'And what were you thinking about ? '
Go and write , don 't let me distract you , ' she said , puckering her lips . ' And I must cut out these little holes , you see ! '
Taking up her scissors she began cutting .
'Come , tell me what it was , ' he said , sitting down beside her and watching the circular movement of her tiny scissors .
'Oh , what was I thinking about ?
About Moscow , and about the nape of your neck . ' 
'Why should such happiness come just to me ?
It is too beautiful ! ' he said , kissing her hand .
'To me the more beautiful it is the more natural it seems . ' 
'Your hair comes to a point behind , ' he said , carefully turning her head round . ' A point ?
Yes , you see ! There !
But enough ! We are engaged on serious matters ! '
But their serious matters did not get on , and they jumped apart guiltily when Kuzma came to say that tea was served .
'And have they returned from town ? ' Levin inquired of Kuzma .
'They 've just come and are unpacking . ' 
'Be quick and come , ' she said as she left the study , ' or else I shall read all the letters without you .
'It is not right to live so , ' he thought . ' Soon it will be three months since I did anything worth mentioning .
This is almost the first day that I have really set to work seriously and what has come of it ?
Even my usual duties - all almost abandoned !
The farm work - why , I hardly even go and see about that !
Sometimes I am sorry to part from her , sometimes I can see she is dull .
No , this can 't go on .
I ought to have been firmer and upheld my independence as a man .
This way I shall get into bad habits and teach them to her too ...
But it is difficult for a dissatisfied man not to reproach some one else , namely , the person most closely connected with the subject of his dissatisfaction .
She takes no interest in our work , in the farm , in the peasants , or in music , though she is quite good at that , or in books .
'You see , your lady has made me sit with her , ' said Agatha Mikhaylovna , glancing with a friendly smile at Kitty .
In these words of Agatha Mikhaylovna 's Levin read the conclusion of the drama which had lately been enacted between Agatha Mikhaylovna and Kitty .
He perceived that despite Agatha Mikhaylovna 's grief at the advent of the new mistress who had taken the reins of management into her own hands , Kitty had conquered and had made the old woman love her .
I 've read your letter , ' said Kitty , handing him a badly @-@ written letter . ' It is from that woman , I think - your brother 's ...
Fancy !
This time she wrote differently : she had found Nicholas Dmitrich , had joined him in Moscow , and had gone with him to a provincial town where he had obtained a post in the Civil Service .
'Read it ... Dolly writes about you , ' Kitty began with a smile , but paused suddenly , noticing the changed expression on her husband 's face .
'What 's the matter ?
Kitty 's look changed at once .
Thoughts of Tanya as a marquise and of Dolly had quite vanished .
'When are you going ? ' she asked .
'I shall go too , may I ? '
What do you mean ? ' he said reproachfully .
'What , indeed ? ' she replied , offended that he seemed opposed to and vexed at her offer . ' Why should I not go ?
'I am going because my brother is dying , ' said Levin , ' but why should you ... ? '
For the same reason as you . ' 
'At such an important time , she thinks only of how dull it will be for her alone here , ' he thought ; and this motive in connection with something so important vexed him .
'It is impossible , ' he replied sternly .
Agatha Mikhaylovna , seeing that a quarrel was imminent , softly put down her cup and went out .
The tone in which her husband had said these words hurt her , especially as he evidently disbelieved what she had said .
'And I say that if you go I shall go with you . I will certainly go ! ' she said hastily and angrily .
'Because it means going goodness knows where , and by what roads ! to what inns !
You would be in my way , ' said Levin , endeavouring to keep cool .
'Not at all !
I shan 't want anything , and where you can go I can . ' 
'Well , if only because that woman is there , with whom you cannot associate ... '
'I don 't know and don 't want to know anything about who and what is there .
I know that my husband 's brother is dying , that my husband is going to him , and that I am going with my husband in order ... '
'Kitty , don 't be angry !
But just think , this matter is so important - it hurts me to think that you are mixing up with it your weakness , your dislike of remaining alone .
Well , if you feel dull alone - well , go to Moscow ! '
'There , you see ! You always attribute bad and vile motives to me , ' she began , with tears of anger and resentment .
'No , this is awful ... being a sort of slave ! ' exclaimed Levin , unable to restrain his annoyance any longer , but immediately conscious that he had dealt a blow to himself .
'Then why did you marry ?
You might have been free !
Why , since you are repenting ? ' she said , and jumped up and ran into the drawing @-@ room .
When he came in after her , she was sobbing .
He began speaking , trying to find words not so much to dissuade as to pacify her .
But she did not listen and did not agree to anything he said .
He stooped and took her resisting hand ; he kissed her hand , her hair , and again her hand , but she remained silent .
But when he took her face in his hands and said ' Kitty ! ' she suddenly recovered , cried a little , and then they made it up .
The single fact that his wife , his Kitty , would be in the same room with a girl off the streets made him shudder with repulsion and horror .
'Go , go ! ' she said with a timid , guilty look at him .
He went out silently , and at the very door came upon Mary Nikolavna , who had heard of his arrival but had not dared to enter .
She was just the same as he had seen her in Moscow - the same stuff dress without collar or cuffs , and the same kindly , dull , pock @-@ marked face , only somewhat stouter .
What is it ? '
'Very bad !
He ... you ... are with your wife ? '
For a moment he did not understand the cause of her confusion , but she immediately explained it .
'I will go ... I will go to the kitchen , ' she brought out .
Levin understood that she referred to his wife , and did not know what to say .
'Come along , come ! ' he said .
But he had hardly moved when the door opened and Kitty looked out .
Levin blushed with shame and vexation at his wife for having placed herself and him in this awkward position ; but Mary Nikolavna blushed still more .
She shrank together , flushed till tears filled her eyes , and seizing the ends of her shawl began twisting them in her red fingers , not knowing what to say or do .
At the first glance Levin saw an expression of eager curiosity in the look with which Kitty gazed at this incomprehensible and terrible woman , but it lasted only an instant .
'Well , how is he ?
How is he ? ' she said , addressing first her husband and then the woman .
He had not expected what he saw and felt when he reached his brother 's side .
He had expected to find him in that state of self @-@ deception which , he had heard , was frequent in consumptive cases and which had so struck him at the time of his brother 's visit to him in the autumn .
He had expected to find the physical signs of approaching death more definite : greater weakness , greater emaciation , but still the same sort of condition generally .
Levin could see the moist thin hair on the temples and the drawn transparent @-@ looking forehead .
'Impossible that this terrible body can be my brother Nicholas , ' he thought .
The glittering eyes glanced severely and reproachfully at the brother who was entering , and this glance immediately established living relations between living people .
Levin at once felt the reproach in the look fixed on him , and a sense of repentance because of his own happiness .
When Constantine took him by the hand , Nicholas smiled .
The smile was very faint , hardly perceptible , and in spite of it the stern expression of the eyes did not change .
'You did not expect to find me like this ? ' he said , speaking with difficulty .
'Yes ... no ... ' said Levin , confusing his words . ' How is it you did not let me know sooner , I mean at the time of my marriage ?
He was impelled to speak in order not to remain silent , but did not know what to say , especially as his brother made no reply but only gazed fixedly at him , evidently trying to fathom the meaning of every word .
Nicholas seemed pleased at this , but said he was afraid the condition he was in might frighten her .
A silence followed .
Suddenly Nicholas moved and began to talk .
From his expression Levin expected him to say something specially significant and important , but Nicholas only talked about his health .
Taking advantage of the first moment of silence , Levin got up , wishing to free himself if only for a few minutes from his painful sensations , and said he would fetch his wife .
'All right , and I will have the place cleaned up a bit .
Tidy up , ' said the invalid with an effort . ' And when you have finished , go away , ' he added , with a questioning look at his brother .
He went out and stopped in the corridor .
Kitty asked with a frightened look .
'Oh , it 's awful ! Awful !
Kitty was silent a moment , looking timidly and pitifully at her husband , then she approached and took hold of his elbow with both hands .
'Kostya , take me to him ! It will be easier for us to bear it together !
Just take me there and then go away , ' she began . ' Try and realize that for me to see you and not to see him is much more painful .
There I can perhaps be of use to him and you .
Please let me ! ' she entreated as if her happiness depended on it .
He was obliged to yield , and having recovered , and quite forgotten Mary Nikolavna , he returned with Kitty to his brother .
Stepping lightly and glancing repeatedly at her husband , showing him a brave face full of sympathy she entered the sick @-@ room , and , turning without haste , noiselessly closed the door .
'It was in Soden we met , but we were not acquainted , ' she said . ' You little thought I should one day be your sister ? '
'You would not have known me again ? ' he asked , with a smile that had lit up his face at her entrance .
What a good thing it is that you did send us word !
Not a day passed without Kostya 's thinking and being anxious about you . ' 
She had not finished speaking before that stern reproachful look of jealousy , felt by the dying for the living , settled on his face .
LEVIN COULD NOT LOOK AT HIS BROTHER calmly and could not be either natural or tranquil in his presence .
When he entered the sickroom his eyes and his attention became clouded without his being conscious of it , and he did not see or distinguish the various details of his brother 's condition .
A cold shudder crept down his back when he began to think of those details .
This made Levin 's position still harder .
He went out continually on all sorts of pretexts , coming back and going out again , incapable of remaining alone .
At her command things were brought in and taken out of the sick @-@ room .
She herself went several times to their own room and , without paying any attention to the people she met , brought back with her sheets , pillow @-@ cases , towels , and shirts .
Levin disapproved of all this , not believing that any good could come of it to the invalid .
Above all he was afraid that his brother might get angry about it .
But the sick man , though apparently indifferent to it all , was not angry but only ashamed , and on the whole appeared rather interested in what she was doing for him .
Kitty , having hurriedly shut the door behind Levin , was not looking that way ; but the invalid moaned and she came toward him .
'Don 't come here , ' muttered the sick man angrily . ' I can myself ... '
'What do you say ? ' asked Mary Nikolavna .
But Kitty had heard , and understood that he felt embarrassed and uncomfortable at being stripped in her presence .
'I 'm not looking , ' she said , helping the arm in . ' Mary Nikolavna , you go round to the other side and put it right , ' she added .
When Levin returned with the bottle he found the invalid arranged in bed and everything around him quite altered .
On another table by the bedside were a glass of some refreshing drink and some powders .
The new doctor took out a stethoscope and sounded him , shook his head , prescribed some medicine and gave extremely precise instructions about giving the medicine and about diet .
He ordered raw or very lightly boiled eggs , and seltzer water with new milk at a certain temperature .
He asked ' Kate , ' as he called her , to come nearer .
'I feel much better , ' he said . ' Had I been with you I should have recovered long ago .
How pleasant ! ' He took her hand and drew it toward his lips , but as if fearful that this might be disagreeable to her he changed his mind , let her hand drop , and merely stroked it .
'Now turn me over on the left side and go to bed , ' he murmured .
No one heard what he said , but Kitty understood him .
Can you ? ' she said , addressing Mary Nikolavna .
'I am afraid to , ' answered Mary Nikolavna .
The patient retained his brother 's hand in his .
Levin felt that he wished to do something with his hand and was pulling at it , and yielded with a sinking heart .
Yes , his brother drew the hand to his lips and kissed it .
Levin , trembling , choking with sobs and unable to utter a word , left the room .
'THOU HAST HID THESE THINGS from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes , ' thought Levin while talking with his wife that night .
He knew too that many great and virile minds , whose thoughts on that subject he had read , had pondered it , and yet did not know a hundredth part of what his wife and Agatha Mikhaylovna knew on the subject .
Different as were those two women , Agatha Mikhaylovna and Kitty - or ' Kate ' as Nicholas called her , and as Levin was also fond of calling her now - in that respect they were exactly alike .
The proof that they knew surely what death was , lay in the fact that they knew without a minute 's hesitation how to behave with the dying and did not fear them .
But Levin and others , though they were able to say a great deal about death , evidently did not know anything , for they feared it and had no notion what to do when people were dying .
Had Levin now been alone with his brother Nicholas , he would have looked at him with horror , and would have waited about in still greater horror not knowing what to do next .
More than that , he did not know what to say , how to look , or how to step .
'I fear that if I look at him he will think I am watching . If I don 't look , he will imagine I am thinking of something else .
She talked to him about herself and about her wedding , smiled , sympathized , caressed him , mentioned cases of recovery , and it was all successful , so she evidently knew what she was about .
When Levin returned to their two rooms for the night he sat with hanging head not knowing what to do .
Not only could he not think of supper , of getting ready for the night , of considering what they were to do , he could not even talk to his wife : he was ashamed to .
Kitty , on the contrary , was more active than usual and even more animated .
She ordered supper to be brought , unpacked their things herself , helped to make the beds and did not forget to sprinkle insect powder on them .
It seemed to Levin that it would be inexcusable to eat , sleep , or even to talk , and he felt that his every movement was improper .
She , however , sorted combs and brushes , and did it all in such a way that there was nothing offensive about it .
However , they could not eat anything , nor sleep for a long time , and even did not go to bed till very late .
'Do you really think he can recover ? ' he asked , looking at the back of her round little head , at the narrow parting which closed every time she drew the comb forward .
'I asked the doctor . He says he can 't live more than three days .
But how can they know ?
Luckily I learnt a good deal in Soden . ' 
'Can there have been such sick people there ? '
'It is so terrible to me that I cannot help seeing him as he was when young ...
You would not believe what a charming lad he was , and I did not understand him then . ' 
I feel that we should have been friends , he and I ... ' she said , and , frightened at her own words , she glanced at her husband , and tears filled her eyes .
'Yes , would have been , ' he said sadly . ' He is really one of those of whom it is said , they are not for this world . ' 
'However , we have hard days before us - let us go to bed , ' said Kitty with a glance at her tiny watch .
NEXT DAY THE PATIENT RECEIVED COMMUNION and Extreme Unction .
During the ceremony he prayed fervently .
In his large eyes , fixed upon an icon which had been placed on a little table covered with a coloured cloth , was a look of such passionate entreaty and hope that Levin was frightened at seeing it .
He knew that this passionate entreaty and hope would only make the parting from the life he so loved more difficult .
Levin knew too that Kitty had strengthened that hope by tales of extraordinary recoveries of which she had heard .
During the sacrament Levin did that which , agnostic though he was , he had done a thousand times before .
He said , addressing himself to God , ' If Thou dost exist , heal this man ( such things have often happened ) , and Thou wilt save both him and me ! '
After receiving Extreme Unction the invalid suddenly felt better .
He even sat up when they brought him some soup , and asked for a cutlet too .
'Better - Yes , much better . - Wonderful ! - It is not at all wonderful . Still , he 's better ! ' they said in whispers , smiling at one another .
The invalid fell quietly asleep , but awoke half an hour later with a fit of coughing , and immediately every hope fled from those around him and from himself .
The reality of his sufferings destroyed it , leaving no trace nor even any recollection of the former hopes , in Levin , Kitty , or the patient himself .
Not referring to what he had believed half an hour previously , as though he were ashamed to remember it , Nicholas told them to give him a bottle of iodine covered with perforated paper for inhaling .
Levin handed it to him , and at once the look of passionate hope with which the invalid had received Extreme Unction was fixed on his brother , demanding from him a confirmation of the doctor 's words to the effect that inhaling iodine worked miracles .
'Kitty is not here ? ' he asked hoarsely , glancing round when Levin had reluctantly confirmed the doctor 's statement .
'No ? Then I can tell you ...
It 's for her sake I went through that comedy - she is such a dear !
'He is dying ! ' she whispered . ' I 'm afraid he 'll die immediately . ' 
He was sitting up with his long back bent , leaning his elbows on the bed and hanging his head .
'What do you feel ? ' asked Levin in a whisper , after a pause .
'I feel I am departing , ' uttered Nicholas with an effort , but very distinctly , as if he were pressing the words out of his body .
He did not lift his head but only turned up his eyes , failing to reach his brother 's face . ' Kate , go away , ' he added .
'Departing ! ' Nicholas repeated .
'Why do you think that ? ' asked Levin , in order to say something .
'Because I am departing , ' he repeated , as if that word pleased him . ' It 's the end . ' 
'You had better lie down , you would feel easier , ' she said .
'I 'll soon be lying , ' he said softly . ' Dead ! ' he added cynically and angrily . ' Well , lay me down if you like . ' 
Levin laid his brother on his back , sat down beside him , and holding his breath gazed at his face .
The dying man lay with closed eyes , but at intervals the muscles of his forehead worked as if he were thinking deeply and intently .
For a long , a very long , time as it seemed to Levin the invalid lay motionless , but he still lived and at long intervals sighed .
Levin was already wearied by the mental strain .
He felt that despite all his mental efforts he could not understand what was ' so ' and was already lagging far behind his dying brother .
And strange to say he felt quite cold , and experienced neither joy nor grief nor a sense of loss , still less of pity , for his brother .
If he had any feeling left for him it was more like envy of that knowledge which the dying man now possessed and which he might not share .
But the end did not come .
The door opened and Kitty appeared .
Levin rose to stop her , but at that moment he heard the dying man move .
'Don 't go , ' said Nicholas and stretched out his hand .
Levin gave him his hand , signing angrily with the other to his wife .
He now no longer thought about death at all .
He was wondering what Kitty was doing , who lived in the next room , and whether the doctor had a house of his own .
He wished to eat and sleep .
Carefully disengaging his hand he felt his brother 's feet .
They were cold , but he was still breathing .
Levin gently disengaged his hand , and without looking at his brother went to his own room and fell asleep .
When he woke , instead of the news he expected , that his brother was dead , he heard that his former condition had returned .
No one , neither his brother nor Kitty , could comfort him .
He was angry with every one , said disagreeable things , blamed everybody for his sufferings , and demanded that they should fetch a celebrated doctor from Moscow .
To all questions of how he felt , he gave the same answer , with an angry and reproachful look : ' I am suffering terribly , intolerably ! '
Kitty tried to help him and comfort him in every possible way , but it was all in vain , and Levin saw that she herself was worn out physically and mentally , though she would not admit it .
That consciousness of death which had been evoked in them all by his farewell to life on the night he had sent for his brother was destroyed .
It was all a lie : a repulsive , insulting , blasphemous lie ; and as a result of his character , and because he loved the dying man more than the others did , Levin felt that lie most painfully .
Levin , who had long wished to reconcile his brothers , even if only at the moment of death , had written to Sergius Ivanich , and having received his answer read it to Nicholas .
Sergius Ivanich wrote that he could not come personally , but , in touching words , asked his brother 's pardon .
The invalid made no comment .
'What am I to write to him ? ' asked Levin . ' I hope you are not angry with him ? '
'No , not at all , ' answered Nicholas , vexed at the question . ' Tell him to send me a doctor . ' 
Another three days of torture went by . The sick man was still in the same condition .
Only the invalid himself did not show that desire , but on the contrary was angry because the doctor had not been fetched , and he continued taking medicine and talking of life .
His sufferings , regularly increasing , did their work of preparing him for death .
There was no position that did not cause him pain ; no moments of forgetfulness ; no part of his body that did not hurt and torment him .
Even the memories , impressions , and thoughts , within his body now aroused in him the same sort of repulsion as the body itself .
The sight of other persons , their words , his own recollections , gave him nothing but pain .
Those about him felt this , and unconsciously did not permit themselves either to move freely , talk or express their own wishes in his presence .
His life was quite swallowed up in a consciousness of suffering and a desire to be released from it .
It was clear the change was taking place within him which would bring him to regard death as a fulfilment of his desires , as happiness .
Formerly every separate desire caused by suffering or privation , such as hunger or thirst , was relieved by some bodily action which brought enjoyment ; but now privation and suffering were not followed by relief , but the attempt to obtain relief occasioned fresh suffering .
Therefore all his desires were merged into one : a desire to be released from all this pain and from its source - his body .
He had no words to express his desire for this liberation , and therefore did not speak of it ; but went on from habit demanding satisfaction of those wishes that could be fulfilled .
'Turn me on the other side , ' he said , and immediately afterwards asked to be put back as he had been .
Tell me something !
Why don 't you speak ? '
Then as soon as they began to talk he shut his eyes and expressed weariness , indifference , and disgust .
On the tenth day after their arrival in that town Kitty fell ill .
She had a headache , was sick , and could not leave her bed all the morning .
The doctor explained her illness as the result of fatigue and agitation , and ordered mental tranquillity .
After dinner , however , Kitty got up and went as usual to the sick man , taking her embroidery .
Nicholas looked at her sternly when she entered , and smiled contemptuously when she said she had been ill .
That day he continually blew his nose and moaned piteously .
'How do you feel ? ' she asked him .
'Worse , ' he answered with an effort . ' It hurts ! '
'Where does it hurt ' ?
'Everywhere . ' 
'To @-@ day it will end , you 'll see , ' said Mary Nikolavna in a whisper , but so that the invalid , whose senses were very acute , was , as Levin saw , sure to hear her .
Nicholas had heard , but the words had no effect on him ; his look remained reproachful and strained .
'He has begun to clutch at himself , ' replied Mary Nikolavna .
'Clutch ? How ? '
'Like this , ' she said , pulling at the folds of her stuff dress .
And Levin noticed that all day long the sick man really kept catching at himself as if wishing to pull something off .
Mary Nikolavna 's prophecy was fulfilled .
Toward night the patient could no longer raise his hands , and only gazed straight before him without changing the attentive concentrated expression of his eyes .
Even when his brother or Kitty bent over him so that he could see them , he did not look at them .
Kitty sent for the priest to read the prayers for the dying .
While the priest read , the dying man showed no sign of life : his eyes were closed .
Levin , Kitty , and Mary Nikolavna stood by the bedside .
The prayers were not yet ended when the dying man stretched himself ; sighed and opened his eyes .
Having finished the prayer , the priest touched the cold forehead with his cross which he then wrapped in his stole , and after standing in silence another two minutes , touched the enormous bloodless hand , which was growing cold .
'He has passed away , ' said the priest and turned to go ; but suddenly the clammy moustache of the dying man moved and from the depth of his chest through the stillness came his voice , sharp and distinct :
The sight of his brother and the proximity of death renewed in Levin 's soul that feeling of horror at the inscrutability , nearness , and inevitability of death which had seized him on that autumn evening when his brother had arrived in the country .
He felt that love had saved him from despair , and that that love under the menace of despair grew still stronger and purer .
Scarcely had the unexplained mystery of death been enacted before his eyes when another mystery just as inexplicable presented itself , calling to love and life .
Her illness was pregnancy .
Only after Anna had left his house , and the English governess sent to ask him whether she was to dine with him or alone , did he for the first time clearly understand his position , and he was horror @-@ struck at it .
What was most painful in his situation was his inability to reconcile his past life with the present state of things .
It was not the past when he lived happily with his wife that perplexed him , the transition from that past to the consciousness of his wife 's infidelity he had already painfully passed through ; that had been trying , but it was comprehensible .
The first two days after his wife 's departure Karenin received petitioners , and his private secretary , attended Committee Meetings , and went to the dining @-@ room to dinner as usual .
Without rendering account to himself why he did it , during those two days he tried with all his might to appear calm and even indifferent .
'Excuse me , your Excellency , for taking the liberty of troubling you !
Karenin appeared to be considering , when suddenly he turned round and sat down at the table .
Dropping his head on his hands he sat thus for a long time , tried several times to speak , but stopped short .
Comprehending his master 's emotion , Korney asked the assistant to come again another time .
Karenin , left alone , realized that he could not any longer maintain an appearance of firmness and calm .
He felt that he could not bear the general pressure of contempt and harshness which he had clearly seen in the faces of that shop @-@ assistant and of Korney , and of every one without exception whom he had met during those two days .
He felt that people would destroy him , as dogs kill a tortured dog that is whining with pain .
He knew that the only way of escape from men was to hide his wounds from them . He had unconsciously tried to do so for two days , and now felt himself unable to continue the unequal struggle .
His despair was heightened by the consciousness that he was quite alone in his sorrow .
Karenin had been left an orphan .
They could not remember their father , and their mother died when Alexis Alexandrovich was ten years old .
They had small means .
Their uncle , Karenin , a high official and at one time a favourite with the late Emperor , brought them up .
Neither at school nor at the university , nor afterwards , in the Service , did he enter into friendly relations with anyone .
His brother was nearest to his heart , but he served under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and always lived abroad , where he died soon after Alexis Alexandrovich 's marriage .
Karenin hesitated long .
He proposed , and devoted to his betrothed and to his wife all the feeling of which he was capable .
His attachment to Anna excluded from his soul any need he had felt for affectionate relations with other persons ; and now , among all his acquaintances , he had no intimate friend .
He was connected with many people , but had friendly relations with none .
There was a fellow @-@ student at the university with whom he had subsequently become friendly , and to whom he might have spoken of his grief ; but that fellow @-@ student was now curator in a distant educational district .
Of the Petersburg people the most intimate and most likely were the doctor , and Michael Vasilich Slyudin , his private secretary .
Once Karenin , having finished signing documents , remained silent a long time , glancing now and then at Michael Vasilich , and tried several times but was unable to begin speaking .
The other person , the doctor , was also well @-@ inclined toward Karenin , but they had long ago come to a tacit understanding that they were both overwhelmed with work and had no time to spare .
Of his women friends , including the principal one among them , the Countess Lydia Ivanovna , Karenin did not think at all .
All women , as such , appeared to him dreadful and repulsive .
KARENIN HAD FORGOTTEN THE COUNTESS Lydia Ivanovna , but she had not forgotten him .
At that most painful time of lonely despair she came to his house and entered his study unannounced .
She found him in the posture in which he had long sat , resting his head on his hands .
'J 'ai forcé la consigne ! [ ' I 've forced my way in . ' ] she said as she entered with hurried steps , breathing heavily from her rapid movement and from excitement .
Alexis Alexandrovich , my dear friend ! ' she continued , firmly clasping his hand in both hers and gazing with her beautiful dreamy eyes into his .
Karenin rose frowning , and disengaging his hand moved a chair toward her .
'If you please , Countess ! - I do not receive because I am ill , ' he said , and his lips trembled .
He was moved , and seizing her plump hand began kissing it .
'My dear friend ! ' she repeated in a voice broken by emotion , ' you must not give way to sorrow .
Your sorrow is great , but you will find consolation . ' 
'You will find support ; do not seek it in me , though I want you to believe in my friendship , ' she replied with a sigh . ' Love is the only support , that love which He has bequeathed us !
His yoke is easy , ' she went on with that ecstatic look he knew so well . ' He will support you and help you ! '
'I am weak - I am done for !
I did not foresee it and don 't understand it now ! '
'My dear friend ! ' Lydia Ivanovna said once more .
'It is not the loss of what no longer exists , it is not that , ' continued Karenin .
'I don 't regret that , but I cannot help feeling ashamed before others of the position I am in .
Karenin frowned , and bending his hands backward began cracking his fingers .
'One must know all the details , ' he said in a high @-@ pitched voice . ' Human strength has its limits , Countess , and I have reached the limits of mine .
All day long I have had to take domestic decisions resulting from ' ( he emphasized the word ' resulting ' ) ' my new solitary position .
The servants , the governess , the bills ...
These petty flames have burnt me , and I was unable to bear it .
I could not bear the way my son looked at me .
He did not ask me the meaning of it all , but he wanted to ask , and I could not endure his look .
He was afraid of looking at me . But this is not all ... '
Karenin was going to mention the bill that had been brought him , but his voice shook and he paused .
He could not think of that bill , made out on blue paper for a bonnet and ribbons , without pitying himself .
'I understand , dear friend , ' said the Countess Lydia Ivanova .
'I understand it all . Not in me will you find help and consolation , though I have come to help you if I can .
If I could take all those trivial humiliating cares off your shoulders ? ...
I see that a woman 's word , a woman 's direction , is wanted .
Karenin silently and gratefully pressed her hand .
'We will look after Serezha together .
I am not good in practical matters , still I will undertake it - I will be your housekeeper .
Do not thank me .
I am not doing it of myself ... '
'I cannot help thanking you . ' 
'But , my dear friend , do not give way to that feeling you were speaking about - of being ashamed of that which is the utmost height of Christianity !
In Him alone you will find peace , comfort , salvation , and love ! ' And raising her eyes to Heaven she began to pray , as Karenin understood from her silence .
Karenin listened to her now , and those very expressions , which formerly had seemed to him if not disagreeable at least superfluous , now seemed natural and comforting .
He did not like that new ecstatic influence .
He was a believer , interested in religion chiefly from a political point of view , and this new teaching which allowed itself some novel interpretation , just because it paved the way for disputes and analyses , was repugnant to him on principle .
He had formerly regarded the new teaching with coldness and even hostility , and had never discussed it with the Countess Lydia Ivanovna ( who was carried away by it ) , but had carefully and silently evaded her challenges .
Now for the first time he listened to her words with pleasure and without mental rejoinder .
'I am very , very grateful to you , both for your actions and your words , ' said he when she had finished praying .
'Now I am going to act , ' she said , smiling and wiping the traces of tears from her face . ' I am going to see Serezha .
Only in extreme cases will I apply to you , ' and she rose and went out .
The Countess went to Serezha 's part of the house and there , watering the frightened boy 's cheeks with her tears , told him that his father was a saint and that his mother was dead .
She really took upon herself the care of arranging and managing Karenin 's household , but she had not exaggerated when she said she was not good at practical matters .
For Karenin it was easy to accept that interpretation .
THE COUNTESS LYDIA IVANOVNA when quite a young and ecstatic girl was married to a rich , aristocratic , very good @-@ natured , and most jovial profligate .
The Countess Lydia had long ago ceased to be in love with her husband , but since then had never ceased to be in love with somebody else .
She was in love with several persons at once , both men and women ; she had been in love with almost every one who was specially notable .
She was in love with all the new Princes and Princesses who became connected with the Imperial family , she was in love with a Metropolitan , a Suffragan , and a priest .
All these passions , ever waxing or waning , did not interfere with her carrying on very widespread and complicated relations with the Court and Society .
The feeling she now had for him seemed to her stronger than any of her former sentiments .
She was not only glad to meet him , but searched his face for signs of the impression she created on him .
She wished to please him not merely by words , but by her whole self .
For his sake she now paid more attention to her dress than ever before .
She caught herself meditating on what might have been had she not married and had he been free .
She blushed with excitement when he entered the room , and could not repress a smile of delight when he said something agreeable to her .
For some days the Countess Lydia Ivanovna had been greatly excited .
A young adjutant , a comrade of Vronsky 's , through whom she had her information , who hoped through her influence to obtain a concession , told her that they had finished their affairs and were leaving Petersburg next day .
Lydia Ivanovna was beginning to breathe freely again , when next morning she received a note and with horror recognized the handwriting .
It was Anna Karenina 's .
The envelope was as thick as parchment ; there was a large monogram on the narrow yellow sheet , and the letter had a delicious perfume .
It was some time before the Countess Lydia Ivanovna could sit down to read the letter .
Her agitation brought on a fit of asthma , to which she was subject .
When she grew calmer , she read the following , written in French :
'MADANIE LA COMTESSE ! - The Christian feelings which fill your heart encourage me to what I feel to be the unpardonable boldness of writing to you .
I am unhappy at being parted from my son .
I entreat you to permit me to see him once before my departure .
Forgive me for reminding you of myself .
I address myself to you , instead of to Alexis Alexandrovich , only because I do not wish to give pain to that high @-@ minded man by reminding him of myself .
Will you send Serezha to me , or shall I come to the house at an appointed time , or will you let me know when and where I can meet him away from home ?
You cannot imagine the yearning I have to see him , and therefore cannot imagine the gratitude which your help will awaken in me . -
Everything in that letter irritated the Countess Lydia Ivanovna : its matter , the hint contained in the word ' magnanimity , ' and especially what seemed to her its free and easy tone .
'Say there will be no answer , ' said the Countess Lydia Ivanovna , and at once opened her blotter and wrote to Karenin that she hoped to meet him about one o 'clock at the Palace , at the Birthday Reception .
'I must talk over an important and sad matter with you , and we can arrange where .
Best of all at my house , where I will have your special tea ready .
He sends a cross , but He also sends strength to bear it , ' she added , to prepare him somewhat .
The Countess Lydia Ivanovna generally wrote two or three notes a day to Karenin .
She liked that way of communicating with him , which had an elegance and secrecy absent in their personal interviews .
Meeting as they were going out , acquaintances chatted about the latest news , the newly awarded honours , and the changes among the highest officials .
'What were you saying about Karenin ? ' inquired the Prince .
'I thought he had it already . ' 
'No , he has aged , ' said the chamberlain .
He is always writing projects now .
He will not release that unfortunate fellow until he has expounded everything , point by point . ' 
Please don 't say anything bad about the Countess . ' 
'And is it true that his wife is here ? '
'Of course not here in the Palace , but she is in Petersburg .
I met her and Alexis Vronsky walking arm in arm on the Morskaya . ' 
Almost at the same time that his wife had left Karenin , the most painful thing that can befall an official - the cessation of his ascent in the Service - had befallen him .
That cessation was an accomplished fact , clearly visible to every one , though Karenin himself had not yet realized that his career was at an end .
He still held an important post , was member of many Commissions and Committees , but he was finished , and from him nothing further was to be looked for .
Whatever he might say , whatever he might propose , he was listened to as if all he was proposing had long been known and was what no one wanted .
Soon after the parting with his wife he began writing a pamphlet on the new legal procedure , the first of an innumerable series of unwanted pamphlets on every administrative department which it was his fate to write .
But Karenin , far from noticing the hopelessness of his position in officialdom and being troubled by it , was more satisfied with his work than ever .
He thought that since he had been without a wife he had served the Lord by means of these very projects more than before .
The evident impatience of the Member of the Council did not trouble Karenin , who left off expounding his project only when the Councillor , profiting by a royal personage 's passing , slipped away .
Left alone , Karenin bowed his head , collecting his thoughts ; and then turned absent @-@ mindedly toward the door where he hoped to meet the Countess Lydia Ivanovna .
Moving his feet deliberately , Karenin , with his usual air of weariness and dignity , bowed to those gentlemen who were talking about him , and his eyes searched through the doorway for the Countess .
'Thank you , ' replied Karenin . ' What a beautiful day it is , ' he added , laying , as was his wont , peculiar stress on the word ' beautiful . ' 
He knew that they were laughing at him , but he no longer looked for anything except hostility from them ; he was already accustomed to it .
Lydia Ivanovna 's dress had cost her a great deal of trouble , as was the case with all her attire of late .
Her purpose in dressing was now quite the reverse of what she had had in view thirty years ago .
As far as Karenin was concerned she attained her object , and to him she seemed attractive .
In his eyes she was the only islet , not of kindly feeling only but of affection , in the ocean of hostility and ridicule which surrounded him .
As he now ran the gauntlet of those mocking eyes he was drawn toward her enamoured look as naturally as a plant is drawn toward the sun .
'I congratulate you , ' she said , indicating the ribbon by a look .
Repressing a smile of pleasure , he shrugged his shoulders and closed his eyes , as if to say that it could not give him pleasure .
The Countess Lydia Ivanovna knew very well that it was one of his greatest pleasures , though he would never confess it .
'How is our angel ? ' asked she , meaning Serezha .
'I can 't say I am quite satisfied with him , ' replied Karenin , raising his eyebrows and opening his eyes . ' And Sitnikov too is dissatisfied with him . ' 
Sitnikov was the tutor to whom Serezha 's secular education was entrusted .
When with Lydia Ivanovna 's help he had returned to life and activity , he had felt it his duty to take his son 's education in hand .
Never having occupied himself with educational matters before , he devoted some time to studying the matter theoretically .
After reading several books on anthropology , pedagogics , and didactics , he formed a plan of education , and having engaged the best Petersburg educationalist for supervision , he set to work .
And this undertaking occupied him continually .
I see in him his father 's heart , and with such a heart a child can 't be bad ! ' said Lydia Ivanovna , enthusiastically .
Well , as far as I am concerned I do my duty , which is all I can do . ' 
'Will you come and see me ? ' said the Countess after a pause . ' We must talk over something painful to you .
I would have given anything to save you from certain memories , but other people think differently .
I had a letter from her .
She is here in Petersburg . ' 
Karenin started at the reference to his wife , but immediately his face assumed a death @-@ like immobility which showed utter helplessness in the matter .
WHEN KARENIN ENTERED the Countess Lydia Ivanovna 's snug little boudoir , which was full of old china and had its walls covered with portraits ; the hostess was not yet there .
Upon a round table covered with a cloth stood a Chinese tea service and a silver kettle over a spirit lamp .
Karenin glanced absent @-@ mindedly at the numberless familiar portraits decorating the boudoir , and sitting down by the table opened a New Testament that was on it .
'Well , now we can sit down quietly , ' said she with an agitated smile , as she squeezed herself in between the table and sofa , ' and have a chat over our tea . ' 
After a few words of preparation the Countess , breathing heavily and blushing , handed him the letter she had received .
'I don 't consider that I have a right to refuse , ' he said timidly , raising his eyes .
'My dear friend , you see no evil in anyone ! '
His face expressed uncertainty and a desire for advice , support , and guidance in a matter he did not understand .
'No , ' she interrupted him , ' there are limits to everything !
I understand immorality , ' she said , not quite sincerely , for she never could have understood that which leads women to immorality , ' but I do not understand cruelty ... and to whom ? To you !
How can she stay in the town you are in ?
But it 's quite true , " Live and learn " !
And I am learning to understand your loftiness and her baseness . ' 
'But is it love , dear friend ?
Is it sincere ?
Granted that you have forgiven her , and do forgive her ; but have we the right to act thus toward the soul of that angel ?
He thinks she is dead .
He prays for her and asks God to forgive her her sins , and it is better so .
But this ... what will he think ? '
'I had not thought of that , ' said Karenin , evidently agreeing with her .
The Countess covered her face with her hands and remained silent .
She was praying .
'If you ask my advice , ' she said , when her prayer was ended and she uncovered her face , ' I do not advise you to do it !
Do I not see how you are suffering , how this has reopened all your wounds !
Of course as usual you are not thinking of yourself .
But what can it lead to ?
Renewed pain for yourself , and pain for the child !
If there is anything human left in her , she herself should not desire it .
No , I advise you unhesitatingly not to allow it , and with your permission I will write to her . ' 
Karenin agreed , and the Countess Lydia Ivanovna wrote in French as follows :
This letter achieved the secret purpose which the Countess Lydia Ivanovna hid even from herself .
It wounded Anna to the depths of her soul .
Karenin too , on returning home from Lydia Ivanovna 's , could not give his attention to his usual occupations nor find that spiritual peace of a believer who has found salvation , which he had felt before .
The memory of the letter he had written to her also tormented him ; above all his forgiveness , which no one wanted , and his care for another man 's child , burned his heart with shame and regret .
He now felt a similar sense of shame and remorse when thinking of his whole past with her , and recalling the awkward words in which , after much hesitation , he had proposed to her .
And there rose before his mind 's eye a whole row of those vigorous , strong , self @-@ assured men , who had always involuntarily attracted his curiosity and attention .
He drove these thoughts from him , and tried to convince himself that he was not living for the present temporal life but for eternal life , and that his soul was full of peace and love .
But the fact that in this temporary insignificant life he had committed , as it seemed to him , some trivial errors , tormented him as much as if the eternal salvation in which he believed did not exist .
'Serezha ! ' said his tutor , a Slav , stopping in the doorway that led to the inner rooms , ' take it off yourself . ' 
But Serezha , though he heard his tutor 's weak voice , paid no heed to it .
He stood holding on by the porter 's shoulder @-@ strap and looking into his face .
The hall @-@ porter nodded affirmatively .
The bandaged official , who had called seven times to petition Karenin about something , interested both Serezha and the hall @-@ porter .
Serezha had met him in the hall , and had heard him piteously begging the porter to announce him to Karenin , and saying that he and his children were face to face with death .
Since then , having again met the official in the hall , Serezha had become interested in him .
'And was he very glad ? ' he asked .
'And has anything been brought ? ' inquired Serezha , after a pause .
'Well , sir , ' said the porter , shaking his head and whispering , ' there is something from the Countess . ' 
Serezha knew at once that the hall @-@ porter was speaking of a birthday present for him from the Countess Lydia Ivanovna .
'You don 't say so ?
'Korney has taken it in to your Papa .
'What size ?
'A book ? '
'Vasily Lukich , one moment ! ' said Serezha with that bright and affectionate smile which always overcame the conscientious Vasily Lukich .
This joy appeared to him particularly important because it coincided with the satisfaction of the official , and his own happiness that a present had been brought .
To Serezha it seemed that this day was one on which everybody ought to be happy and gay .
'And your daughter , has she been here lately ? '
'How can she come on week @-@ days ?
They have to learn too , and so must you , sir ! Go along ! '
On entering the schoolroom , instead of sitting down to his lessons , Serezha told his tutor of his guess that the parcel that had been brought must be a railway train . ' What do you think ? ' he asked .
But Vasily Lukich only thought that Serezha must prepare his grammar lesson , as his teacher was coming at two .
'Oh , but just tell me , Vasily Lukich ! ' said Serezha , suddenly , after sitting down at the table with a book in his hand . ' What is higher than the Alexander Nevsky ?
Vasily Lukich replied that the Order of Vladimir was higher .
'And higher still ? '
'The highest is the St Andrew . ' 
'And higher still ? '
'Even you don 't know ! ' And Serezha , leaning his elbows on the table , began to reflect .
His reflections were most complex and varied .
As soon as it was invented he would gain it .
In these reflections time passed until the teacher arrived . The lesson on the attributes of Time , Place , and Manner of Action had not been learnt .
He chose a moment when the teacher was looking silently into the book :
'Michael Ivanovich , when is your birthday ? ' he suddenly asked .
'You would do better to think of your work . Birthdays do not signify anything to reasonable beings .
It is just a day like any other , on which we must work . ' 
He was aware that the teacher himself did not believe what he was saying ; he felt that by the tone in which the words were uttered .
'But why have they all agreed to speak in the same way about the dullest and most useless things ?
Why does he repulse me ? Why does he not love me ? ' he asked himself sadly , and could find no answer .
Before his father came Serezha sat at the table playing with a pocket @-@ knife and thinking .
Among his favourite occupations was keeping a look out for his mother when he went out walking .
He imagined that every well @-@ developed and graceful woman with dark hair was his mother .
At the sight of any such woman a feeling of such tenderness awoke in his heart that he grew breathless and tears came to his eyes .
He expected that at any moment she would approach and lift her veil .
The lady did not come up to them and disappeared somewhere .
Vasily Lukich roused him . ' Your Papa is coming ! '
Serezha jumped up , approached his father , kissed his hand , and looked at him attentively , trying to find some sign of his joy at receiving the Order of Alexander Nevsky .
'Have you had a nice walk ? ' asked Karenin , as he sat down in his arm @-@ chair , drew toward him an Old Testament and opened it .
Although Karenin had more than once told Serezha that every Christian ought to be well acquainted with Bible history , he often in Old Testament history had to consult the book , and Serezha noticed this .
'Yes , Papa , it was very amusing , ' answered Serezha , sitting down sideways on his chair and beginning to rock it , which was forbidden . ' I met Nadenka ' ( Nadenka was Lydia Ivanovna 's niece , who was being educated at her aunt 's house ) .
'First of all , don 't rock your chair , ' said Karenin . ' Secondly , it 's not the reward but the work that is precious .
It was the same long @-@ familiar tone in which his father always addressed him , and to which Serezha had already learnt to adapt himself .
'You understand me , I hope , ' said the father .
'Yes , Papa , ' answered the boy , pretending to be that imaginary boy .
The lesson consisted in learning by heart some verses from the Gospels and repeating the beginning of the Old Testament .
It was evident to Karenin that the boy did not understand what he was saying , and this irritated him .
He frowned and began an explanation that Serezha had heard many times already and could never remember because he understood it too clearly , just as he could not remember that the word suddenly was an attribute of the manner of action .
Serezha looked at his father with scared eyes , and could only think of whether his father would make him repeat what he had just said , as he sometimes did .
This thought frightened him so much that he no longer understood anything at all .
Serezha related the events themselves quite well , but when he had to answer questions as to what some of the events symbolized , he knew nothing about it , though he had been punished before for not knowing this lesson .
The part , however , about which he could not say anything at all but only floundered , cut the table , and rocked his chair , was that about the antediluvian patriarchs .
He did not know any of them except Enoch , who was taken up to Heaven alive .
He did not in the least believe in death , which was so often mentioned to him .
He did not believe that people he loved could die , nor above all that he himself would die .
That seemed to him quite impossible and incomprehensible .
But he was told that everybody would die ; he had even asked people whom he trusted and they all confirmed it ; his nurse too said so , though reluctantly .
But Enoch had not died , so not everybody died , ' and why should not anybody deserve the same in God 's sight , and be taken up to Heaven alive ? ' thought Serezha .
Bad people , that is to say those he did not like , might die ; but the good ones might all be like Enoch .
'Well , who were the patriarchs ? '
'But you have already mentioned them .
This is bad , Serezha , very bad !
If you do not take pains to know what is most necessary for a Christian , then what can interest you ?
I am displeased with you , and Peter Ignatych ' - this was the chief educationalist - ' is also displeased with you ...
His father and the educationalist were both displeased with Serezha , and he really learnt badly .
Yet it could not at all be said that he was an incapable boy .
On the contrary he was far more capable than the boys whom the educationalist set before him as models .
His father from his point of view considered that the boy did not try to learn what he was being taught .
As a matter of fact , he could not learn it .
He could not , because there were more urgent demands on his soul than those put forward by his father and the educationalist .
The two kinds of demands were opposed , and he was in direct conflict with his instructors .
His instructors complained that he would not learn , yet his soul was overflowing with longing for knowledge .
So he learnt , from Kapitonich , from his nurse , from Nadenka , and from Vasily Lukich , but not from his teachers .
The water which his fathers and the educationalists expected would turn their mill @-@ wheels had long since leaked out and was working somewhere else .
His father punished Serezha by not letting him go to see Lydia Ivanovna 's niece Nadenka , but this punishment turned out luckily for Serezha .
Vasily Lukich was in good spirits and showed him how to make windmills .
'Vasily Lukich ! Do you know for what I have been praying extra ? '
'To learn better ? '
When it comes true , I will tell you .
'No , I can 't guess .
You 'd better tell me , ' said Vasily Lukich , smiling , which he rarely did . ' Well , lie down , and I 'll put out the candle . ' 
'But I can see better without a candle what I have been praying for !
There , I nearly told you the secret ! ' said Serezha with a merry laugh .
When the candle had been taken away he heard and felt his mother .
She stood above him and caressed him with a loving look .
But then windmills appeared , and a knife , and all became confused , and he fell asleep .
WHEN VRONSKY AND ANNA REACHED PETERSBURG they put up at one of the best hotels : Vronsky separately on the first floor , and Anna with the baby , the nurse , and a maid , upstairs in a large suite consisting of four rooms .
On the day they arrived Vronsky went to see his brother .
There he met his mother , who had come from Moscow on business .
His mother and his sister @-@ in @-@ law received him just as usual , asked him about his trip abroad and spoke of mutual acquaintances , but did not say a single word about his union with Anna .
Despite all his experience of the world , Vronsky , in the new position in which he found himself , was making a terrible mistake .
'Of course they will not receive her at Court , but intimate friends can and should see things the right way , ' he thought .
This was what Vronsky experienced with regard to Society .
Though in the depths of his soul he knew that Society was closed to them , he tried whether it would not change and whether it would not receive them .
But he very soon noticed that though the great world was open to him personally , it was closed to Anna .
One of the first Petersburg Society ladies he met was his cousin Betsy .
Where are you staying ?
I can imagine how dreadful our Petersburg must appear to you after your delightful journey ; I can picture to myself your honeymoon in Rome .
Is it all arranged ? '
He noticed that Betsy 's delight cooled down when she learnt that Anna had not yet been divorced .
'They will throw stones at me , I know , ' she said , ' but I shall come and see Anna . Yes , I will certainly come .
You are not staying here long ? '
And really she came to see Anna that same day ; but her manner was very different from what it had formerly been .
She was evidently proud of her boldness and wished Anna to appreciate the fidelity of her friendship .
She did not stay more than ten minutes , chattering Society gossip , and as she was leaving said :
Of course I have kicked over the traces , but others , straight @-@ laced people , will give you the cold shoulder until you get married .
And it is so simple nowadays !
From Betsy 's tone Vronsky might have realized what he had to expect from Society , but he made another attempt with his relations .
Of his mother he had no hopes .
He knew that his mother , who had been so delighted with Anna when she first made her acquaintance , was now merciless toward her for having caused the ruin of her son 's career .
But he placed great hopes on Varya , his brother 's wife .
She , he thought , would cast no stones , but would simply and resolutely go and see Anna and receive her at her own house .
The day after his arrival Vronsky called on her , and having found her alone , expressed his wish .
'Please don 't think I am condemning you . Not at all !
Perhaps in her place I should have done the same . I do not and cannot enter into details , ' she added , looking timidly into his gloomy face .
'But we must call things by their real names . You wish me to go and see her and to receive her , and so rehabilitate her in Society ; but please understand that I cannot do it !
I have daughters growing up , and I must move in Society , for my husband 's sake .
'Alexis , don 't be angry with me !
Please understand that it is not my fault , ' said Varya , looking at him with a timid smile .
'I am not angry with you , ' he said just as gloomily , ' but I am doubly pained .
I am pained too because this breaks our friendship .
No , not breaks it , but weakens it .
You understand that for me too there can be no other course '  . ' 
With those words he left her .
One of the most disagreeable features of his position in Petersburg was that Karenin seemed to be everywhere and his name in every mouth .
It was impossible to start any conversation without its turning upon Karenin , impossible to go anywhere without meeting him .
So at least it seemed to Vronsky , as a man with a sore finger feels that he is continually knocking that finger against everything as if on purpose .
The stay in Petersburg seemed to him still more trying because he noticed all the time in Anna a new and to him incomprehensible mood .
At one moment she appeared to be in love with him , and at the next would turn cold , irritable , and impenetrable .
ONE OF ANNA 'S REASONS FOR RETURNING TO RUSSIA was to see her son .
From the day she left Italy the thought of that meeting did not cease to agitate her .
The nearer they came to Petersburg the greater its joy and importance appeared .
She did not ask herself how she should contrive it .
The thought of her son did not leave her for an instant , but she had not yet seen him .
She felt she had not the right to go straight to the house where she might encounter Karenin .
Possibly they might even not admit her .
It was painful to her even to think of writing to and coming into contact with her husband : she could be calm only when she did not think of him .
Serezha 's old nurse might have helped and advised her , but she was no longer in Karenin 's household .
She knew that if that letter were shown to him he , continuing his magnanimous role , would not refuse her request .
The commissionaire who delivered her letter brought back the most cruel and unexpected reply : that there would be no answer !
Anna felt herself humiliated and wounded , but she saw that the Countess Lydia Ivanovna was right from her own point of view .
Her grief was the more poignant because she had to bear it alone .
She could not share it with Vronsky and did not wish to .
She knew that , though he was the chief cause of her misery , the question of her seeing her son would seem to him quite unimportant .
She knew he would never be able to appreciate the depth of her anguish , and that his coldness if the matter were mentioned would make her hate him .
And she feared that , more than anything else in the world , and therefore hid from him everything concerning her son .
Having spent all that day at the hotel considering how she might see her son , she resolved to write to her husband .
She had already composed the letter when she received Lydia Ivanovna 's reply .
'That coldness , that pretence of feeling ! ' she said to herself . ' They want to wound me and torture the child , and shall I submit to them ?
She would go early in the morning , at about eight , when Karenin would certainly not be up .
The only thing she did not prepare was what she would say to her son .
Much as she thought about that she could not prepare the words .
Next morning Anna went alone , and at eight o 'clock got out of the hired carriage and rang the bell at the front door of the house which used to be her home .
It 's some lady , ' said Kapitonich , who was not yet dressed , and in overcoat and goloshes peeped from the window at the veiled lady standing close to the door .
His assistant , a lad whom Anna did not know , had hardly opened the door when she entered , and taking a three @-@ rouble note from her muff hastily thrust it into his hand .
Sergey Alexeyich ! ' she said , and walked on .
After examining the note the porter 's assistant stopped her at the inner glass door .
Noticing the stranger 's confusion , Kapitonich himself came out , admitted her , and inquired what she wanted .
'I come from Prince Skorodumov to see Sergey Alexeyich , ' said she .
'He is not up yet , ' said the hall @-@ porter , carefully scrutinizing her face .
Anna had not foreseen at all that the totally unaltered appearance of the hall of the house where she had lived for nine years would so deeply affect her .
One memory after another , both joyful and painful , rose in her mind , and for a moment she forgot why she had come .
'Would you like to wait ? ' said Kapitonich , helping her off with her cloak .
Having done so he glanced again at her face and , recognizing her , silently bowed low .
'Come in , Your Excellency , ' he said .
She wished to speak , but her voice refused to utter a sound ; with a look of guilty entreaty at the old man she went with light steps up the stairs .
Bending forward and catching the steps with his goloshes , Kapitonich ran after her , trying to overtake her .
'The tutor may be there and not yet dressed .
Anna continued to ascend the familiar steps without understanding what the old man was saying .
'Let me in , let me in ! ' she cried , and entered at the big door .
To the right of the door stood a bed on which sat the boy , his nightshirt unbuttoned , bending his little body backward , stretching himself and finishing his yawn .
At the moment when his lips were closing they extended into a blissful sleepy smile , and with that smile he again fell slowly and sweetly backwards .
'Serezha ! ' she whispered , drawing nearer with inaudible steps .
During the time they had been parted and under the influence of that gush of love which she had felt for him of late she had always imagined him as a little fellow of four , the age when she had loved him best .
Now he was not even as she had left him ; he was still further removed from the four @-@ year @-@ old child ; he had grown still more and had got thinner .
How long his arms !
How changed since she had left him !
But still it was he : the slope of the head was his , the lips were his , the soft neck and the broad shoulders .
'Serezha ! ' she repeated , just above the child 's ear .
He raised himself again on his elbow , moved his tousled head from side to side as if seeking for something , and opened his eyes .
'Serezha , my dear little boy ! ' she uttered , catching her breath and embracing his plump little body .
'Mama ! ' he muttered , wriggling about in her arms so as to touch them with different parts of his body .
'I knew ! ' he said , opening his eyes . ' To @-@ day is my birthday .
I knew you would come !
While saying this he was again falling asleep .
Anna watched him with greedy eyes . She noticed how he had grown and changed during her absence .
She touched it all , and could not speak : tears were choking her .
'What are you crying about , Mama ? ' he asked , now quite awake . ' Mama , what are you crying about ? ' he exclaimed in a fretful voice .
'How do you dress without me ?
How do you ... ' She tried to speak simply and cheerfully , but could not , and turned away again .
'I don 't wash with cold water . Papa says I mustn 't .
You have not seen Vasily Lukich ?
And you are sitting on my clothes ! '
'Well , and what did you think about me ?
You did not think I was dead ? '
'You didn 't believe it , my darling ? '
'I knew ! I knew ! ' he cried , repeating his favourite phrase , and seizing her hand , which was caressing his hair , he pressed her palm to his mouth , covering it with kisses .
But the caresses of the mother and son , the sound of their voices and what they were saying , made him change his mind .
He shook his head , sighed , and closed the door again .
'I will be another ten minutes , ' he said to himself , coughing and wiping away his tears .
Meanwhile among the servants there was great commotion .
Korney , the valet , went down into the hall @-@ porter 's room to inquire who had let her in , and hearing that it was Kapitonich who had done so , he reprimanded the old man .
The hall @-@ porter remained obstinately silent ; but when the valet said he ' ought to get the sack , ' Kapitonich rushed at Korney and , flourishing his hands about before Korney 's face , began to speak out :
'Yes , I daresay you would not have let her in !
I 've been in service here ten years , and have had nothing but kindness : you had better go up and tell her , " You be off , please ! "
You 're an artful one , you are !
You 'd better look after yourself and how to fleece the master of fur coats ! '
When the nurse entered , Serezha was just telling his mother how he and Nadenka fell down together when ice @-@ hilling , and turned three somersaults .
She was listening to the sound of his voice , saw his face and the play of his features , felt his hands , but did not understand what he was saying .
She must go away , must leave him - that was all she thought and felt .
She heard Vasily Lukich 's step as he came to the door and coughed , and then the steps of the nurse as she entered ; but she sat as if turned to stone , powerless to speak or rise .
'Madam , dear ! ' the nurse began , coming up to Anna and kissing her hands and shoulders . ' What joy God has sent our little one on his birthday !
And you have not changed at all . ' 
Suddenly the nurse burst into tears and again began to kiss Anna 's hand .
Serezha , with bright eyes and beaming smile , holding his mother with one hand and his nurse with the other , jumped with his plump bare feet on to the carpet .
The tenderness of his beloved nurse for his mother sent him into raptures .
She could not say good @-@ bye , but the expression of her face said it and he understood . ' Darling , darling Kutik ! ' she said , calling him by the pet name she used when he was quite little , ' you won 't forget me ?
You ... ' but she could say no more .
How many things she thought of later that she might have said !
But now she did not know what to say and could not speak .
But Serezha understood all she wanted to tell him .
He understood that she was unhappy and that she loved him .
He had even understood what the nurse had said in a whisper .
He had caught the words ' always before nine o 'clock , ' and he understood that they referred to his father and that his mother and father must not meet .
This he had grasped , but he could not make out why that look of fear and shame appeared on her face ...
She could not have done wrong , and yet seemed afraid and ashamed of something .
He wanted to ask a question which would clear up his doubts , but dared not ; he saw that she suffered and he was sorry for her .
He pressed against her in silence , and then whispered :
'Serezha , my darling ! ' she said , ' love him ! He is better and kinder than I , and I am to blame toward him .
'There is nobody better than you ! ... ' he cried out in desperation through his tears , and seizing her by her shoulders he hugged her with all his might , his arms trembling with the effort .
'Darling little one ! ' said Anna , and began to cry in the same weak and childlike way as he .
At that moment the door opened and Vasily Lukich entered .
Serezha sank down on his bed and began to sob , hiding his face in his hands .
Anna moved the hands away , kissed him again on his wet face , and went rapidly out .
Karenin was advancing toward her .
When he saw her , he stopped and bowed his head .
She swiftly let down her veil and with quickened steps almost ran out of the room .
She had not had time even to unwrap the toys she had chosen with so much love and sadness the day before , and she took them back with her .
On returning to her lonely suite in the hotel she could not for a long time understand why she was there .
'Yes , it is all ended and I am alone again , ' she said to herself ; and without taking off her bonnet she sat down in an easy @-@ chair by the fireplace .
With her eyes fixed on a bronze clock , standing on a table between the windows , she began pondering .
The French maid , whom she had brought from abroad , came and asked whether she would not dress .
'Later , ' she said .
The Italian nurse , having smartened up the baby girl , came in and held her out to Anna .
Everything about this baby was sweet , but for some reason she did not grip the heart .
And from him she was for ever sundered , not only physically but spiritually , and there was no remedy for it .
She returned the baby to its nurse , sent them away , and opened a locket with Serezha 's portrait as a baby about the same age as the little girl .
Rising , she removed her bonnet and took from the table an album in which were photographs of her son at different ages .
She wanted to compare these likenesses and began drawing them out of the album .
She took them all out but one , the last and best of the photographs .
He was there in a white shirt , astride a chair , his brows frowning while his mouth smiled .
This was his most characteristic and best expression .
'Yes , there he is ! ' she said with a glance at Vronsky 's likeness , and suddenly remembered that he was the cause of her present grief .
She had not called him to mind all that morning ; but now , having caught sight of that manly , noble face , so familiar and dear to her , she felt an unexpected flow of love toward him .
How can he leave me alone in my anguish ? ' she suddenly thought with a sense of reproach , forgetting that she herself had hidden from him all that concerned her son .
The servant returned with the reply that he had a visitor , but would come up at once , and wished to know whether he might bring with him Prince Yashvin , who had just arrived in Petersburg .
And suddenly a strange idea crossed her mind : what if he had ceased to love her ?
'But he must tell me .
I must know it !
If I know it , then I know what I shall do , ' she told herself , powerless to imagine the position she would find herself in when she was convinced of his indifference .
She imagined that he had ceased to love her , and she was almost in despair : which roused in her a feeling of peculiar excitement .
She heard the bell before she was ready .
When she entered the drawing @-@ room not his eyes but Yashvin 's met hers .
Vronsky was examining her son 's photos , which she had forgotten on the table , and did not hurry to look at her .
Let me have them , ' she added , with a rapid movement taking from Vronsky the photos he was looking at , and glancing at him impressively with glistening eyes . ' Were the races good this year ?
I saw the races on the Corso in Rome instead !
But of course you don 't care for life abroad , ' she went on with a pleasant smile : ' I know you and know all your tastes , though we have met so seldom . ' 
'I am very sorry to hear it , for my tastes are mostly bad , ' said Yashvin , biting the left side of his moustache .
After a short talk , noticing that Vronsky looked at the clock , Yashvin asked her whether she would be staying long in Petersburg , and straightening his immense body picked up his cap .
'Not long , I think , ' she replied with embarrassment glancing at Vronsky .
'Then we shall not meet again ? ' said Yashvin , rising ; and then turning to Vronsky he asked , ' Where are you dining ? '
Of all his regimental friends Alexis liked you best . ' 
'I shall be very pleased , ' said Yashvin , with a smile which showed Vronsky that he liked Anna very much .
Yashvin bowed and went out . Vronsky remained behind .
'You are going too ? ' she asked .
I shall catch you up in a minute ! ' he shouted to Yashvin .
She took his hand and looked fixedly at him , trying to think of something to say to prevent his leaving her .
'Wait - I have something to tell you , ' she said , and raising his short hand she pressed it to her neck . ' Was it wrong of me to ask him to dinner ? '
'You have done very well , ' he replied , showing his compact row of teeth in a calm smile , and kissing her hand .
'Alexis , you have not changed toward me ? ' she asked , squeezing his hand in both hers . ' Alexis , I am in torment here !
When are we going ? '
'Soon , very soon !
You would hardly believe how trying our life here is to me too , ' he said , drawing away his hand .
'Well , then go ! Go ! ' she said in an offended tone , and quickly left him .
WHEN VRONSKY RETURNED Anna had not yet come home .
He was told that , soon after he left , a lady came to see her and they went away together .
He decided that it was necessary to have an explanation with her , and he waited for her in the drawing @-@ room .
She it was who had been to see Anna that morning , and they had been shopping together .
Anna seemed not to notice the worried look of inquiry on Vronsky 's face , but chattered gaily about what she had been buying .
The table was laid for four .
They were all assembled and about to enter the little dining @-@ room , when Tushkevich arrived with a message for Anna from the Princess Betsy .
The Princess asked to be excused for not coming to say good @-@ bye ; she was not well , but asked Anna to come and see her between half @-@ past six and nine .
Vronsky glanced at Anna when that definite time was mentioned , which showed that care had been taken to prevent her meeting anyone there ; but Anna did not seem to observe it .
'I 'm sorry that between half @-@ past six and nine is just the time when I cannot come , ' she replied with a faint smile .
'The Princess will be very sorry . ' 
'And I too . ' 
'I expect you are going to hear Patti ? ' asked Tushkevich .
That 's an idea !
I would go if I could get a box . ' 
'I could get you one , ' said Tushkevich .
'I should be very , very grateful if you would ! ' replied Anna . ' But won 't you stay and dine with us ? '
Vronsky slightly shrugged his shoulders .
He could not in the least understand what Anna was after .
He looked seriously at her , but she answered him with the same provocative glance of high spirits or desperation , the meaning of which he could not make out .
At dinner Anna was aggressively merry , seeming to flirt with both Tushkevich and Yashvin .
After dinner Tushkevich went to get a box and Yashvin to have a smoke . Vronsky went with Yashvin down to his own rooms , but after sitting with him a while , ran upstairs again .
'You are really going to the theatre ? ' said he , trying not to look at her .
'Why do you ask in such a frightened way ? ' she said , again offended because he did not look at her . ' Why should I not go ? '
'Of course there is no reason whatever , ' he replied with a frown .
'That 's just what I say , ' she answered , purposely ignoring the sarcasm of his tone and calmly pulling up her long perfumed glove .
'Anna ! For heaven 's sake , what has come to you ? ' he said , trying to recall her to her senses , as her husband once used to do .
'I don 't understand your question . ' 
'Why ?
" But don 't you know ... ? ' he began .
Do I repent of what I have done ? No !
If it had to begin again from the beginning I should do just the same .
For us , for you and me , only one thing is important : whether we love each other .
No other considerations exist .
Why do we live here , separated and not seeing one another ?
Why don 't you look at me ? '
He saw all the beauty of her face and of her dress , which suited her as her dresses always did .
But now it was just this beauty and elegance that irritated him .
'My feelings cannot change , you know that ; but I beg you not to go ! I entreat you ! ' he said , again speaking French with tender entreaty in his voice but with a cold look in his eyes .
She did not hear his words , but saw the coldness of his look , and replied irritably :
'And I beg you will explain why I should not go . ' 
'Because it might cause you ... ' He became confused .
VRONSKY FOR THE FIRST TIME FELT VEXED and almost angry with Anna for her unwillingness to realize her position .
This feeling was strengthened by the fact that he could not tell her the reason of his vexation .
But he could not say this to her .
'But how can she fail to understand it ? And what is happening to her ? ' he asked himself .
He felt that his regard for her had diminished and his consciousness of her beauty increased simultaneously .
He went down frowning to his rooms , and taking a seat beside Yashvin , who sat with his long legs stretched out on a chair drinking brandy and seltzer , ordered the same for himself .
'You were talking about Lankovsky 's Powerful .
He is a good horse , and I advise you to buy him , ' said Yashvin , glancing at his comrade 's gloomy countenance . ' It 's true he has a goose rump , but his legs and head leave nothing to be desired . ' 
'I think I 'll take him , ' replied Vronsky .
This conversation about horses interested him , but he never forgot Anna , and involuntarily listened to the steps in the corridor and glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece .
Yashvin emptied another glass of brandy into the sparkling water , drank it , and then rose , buttoning his coat .
'Well , let us go , ' he said , smiling slightly under cover of his big moustache , and showing by that smile that he understood the cause of Vronsky 's depression , but did not attach importance to it .
'I 'm not going , ' said Vronsky dismally .
But why not come to the stalls ? Take Krasinsky 's place , ' Yashvin added as he went out .
'No , I have something to do . ' 
'With a wife one has trouble , but with one who is not a wife it 's worse , ' thought Yashvin as he left the hotel .
Left alone , Vronsky got up and began pacing the room .
'What is on to @-@ day ?
The fourth abonnement ...
Alexander will be there with his wife , and probably Mother also .
Am I afraid , or have I put her under Tushkevich 's protection ?
Why does she put me in such a position ? ' he said with a wave of his arm .
As he made this gesture he struck the little table on which the seltzer and a decanter of brandy were standing and almost knocked it over .
'If you wish to remain in my service , ' he said to the valet when the latter came in , ' remember your duties .
Vronsky entered the theatre at half @-@ past eight .
The performance was in full swing .
Through a door slightly ajar came the sounds of a muffled staccato accompaniment by the orchestra and of a female voice rendering a musical phrase with precision .
The door opened to let an attendant slip through , and the nearly completed phrase struck Vronsky 's ears distinctly .
The door was closed immediately and he did not hear the end of the phrase nor the trill after it , but knew from the thunder of applause behind the door that the trill was finished .
When he entered the auditorium , brilliantly illuminated by chandeliers and bronze gas brackets , the noise still continued .
The conductor from his raised seat helped to pass the bouquets , and rearranged his white tie .
Vronsky went to the middle of the floor , then stopped and looked around him .
To @-@ day he paid less attention than ever to the familiar surroundings : the stage , the noise , and all that well @-@ known , uninteresting , motley herd of audience in the packed theatre .
To these oases Vronsky at once turned his attention and immediately got into touch with them .
Vronsky had not yet seen Anna , he intentionally avoided looking her way ; but from the direction in which people were looking he knew where she was .
He glanced around unobtrusively , but did not look at her : prepared for the worst , he looked for Karenin .
Luckily for him , Karenin was not in the theatre that evening .
'How little of the military man is left in you ! ' remarked Serpukhovskoy . ' You might be a diplomatist , an artist , or anything of that kind . ' 
'Yes , as soon as I returned home I put on a black coat , ' Vronsky replied with a smile , slowly taking out his opera @-@ glasses .
'Now in that , I confess , I envy you !
I , when I come back from abroad and put this on again , regret my freedom , ' he said , touching his shoulder @-@ knot .
Serpukhovskoy had long ago ceased to trouble himself about Vronsky 's career , but was as fond of him as ever and was particularly amiable to him now .
Next to a lady wearing a turban , and a bald old man who blinked angrily just as Vronsky 's moving glass reached him , he suddenly saw Anna 's proud head , strikingly beautiful , and smiling in its frame of lace .
She was in the fifth box in the lower tier , some twenty paces from him .
The poise of her head on her fine broad shoulders , and the gleam of restrained excitement in her eyes and her whole face , reminded him precisely of how he had seen her at the ball in Moscow .
But her beauty affected him very differently now .
There was no longer anything mysterious in his feelings for her , and therefore though her beauty attracted him even more strongly , it also offended him .
She was not looking his way , but he felt that she had already seen him .
Yashvin 's face wore the expression it had when he was losing at cards .
He was frowning and drawing the left side of his moustache further and further into his mouth , looking askance at the adjoining box .
In that box to the left were the Kartasovs .
Vronsky knew them and knew that Anna had been acquainted with them .
The wife , a thin little woman , was standing up in her box with her back to Anna , putting on an opera @-@ cloak which her husband was holding for her .
Her face looked pale and angry and she was speaking excitedly .
Kartasov , a stout bald @-@ headed man , kept glancing round at Anna while trying to pacify his wife .
When the wife left the box the husband loitered behind , trying to catch Anna 's eye and evidently wishing to bow to her .
But Anna , with obvious intention , took no notice of him and , turning round , was saying something to Yashvin , whose cropped head was bent toward her .
Kartasov went out without bowing and the box remained empty .
Vronsky could not make out what had taken place between the Kartasovs and Anna , but he saw that it was something humiliating for Anna .
He realized that from what he had seen , and especially from Anna 's face , who , he knew , was summoning her utmost strength to sustain the role she had undertaken .
She fully succeeded in playing that role - of external tranquillity .
Knowing that something had happened , but not knowing just what , Vronsky felt painfully agitated , and , hoping to find out something , set out for his brother 's box .
Intentionally leaving the auditorium at the opposite side to where Anna was , he encountered the Commander of his old regiment , who stood talking to two acquaintances .
Vronsky heard them mention the name of Karenin , and noticed how the Commander hastened to call him loudly by name , with a significant glance at the others .
We can 't let you go away without a feast .
You are one of our very own ! ' said the Commander .
'I shall not have time ... I 'm very sorry ! Some other time , ' said Vronsky , and ran up the stairs to his brother 's box .
In the box was Vronsky 's mother , the old Countess , with her iron @-@ grey curls .
Varya and the Princess Sorokina he met in the corridor outside .
Having conducted the Princess Sorokina back to Vronsky 's mother , Varya held out her hand to her brother @-@ in @-@ law and at once began to talk of the matter that interested him .
'You know I shall be the last to hear of it ! '
'Is there a creature more venomous than that Kartasova ? '
Her husband began conversing with her from his box , and Kartasova flew at him !
It seems she said something insulting out loud , and then went out . ' 
'Count , your maman wants you , ' said the Princess Sorokina , looking out of the box door .
'I have been expecting you all the time , ' said his mother with a sarcastic smile . ' I never see anything of you . ' 
Her son saw that she could not repress a smile of satisfaction .
I was coming to you , ' he replied coldly .
'Maman ! I asked you not to speak to me about that subject , ' he answered frowning .
'I am saying what every one says . ' 
Vronsky did not reply , and after a few words addressed to the Princess Sorokina he left the box .
In the doorway he met his brother .
'Ah , Alexis ! ' said his brother . ' What a shame .
I was just going to see her !
Vronsky did not listen to him .
He hurried downstairs feeling that he must do something , he knew not what .
He was disturbed both by vexation with Anna for placing herself and him in this false position , and by pity for her sufferings .
He descended to the stalls and went straight to Anna 's box , in front of which stood Stremov talking to her .
Vronsky bowed to her and stopped to shake hands with Stremov .
'I think you got here late and missed the finest aria , ' said Anna to him , with a mocking glance as it seemed to him .
'I am a poor judge , ' he replied , looking severely at her .
She rose and went to the back of the box .
Anna had already returned .
When Vronsky entered she was still dressed as she had been at the theatre .
She was sitting in the first arm @-@ chair by the wall , fixedly gazing before her .
'It 's all your fault ! Your fault ! ' she exclaimed with tears of despair and spite in her voice , and rose .
'But I asked , I entreated you not to go ! - I knew it would be unpleasant for you ! '
However long I may live I shall never forget it !
She said it was a disgrace to sit near me . ' 
'The words of a silly woman ; ' he said . ' But why risk it ? Why provoke ... '
'I hate your calmness !
You should not have driven me to it .
If you loved me ... '
Is it a question of my love ? ... '
'Yes ! If you loved me as I love you , if you suffered the anguish I do ... ' she replied with a frightened glance at him .
He was sorry for her and yet vexed with her .
He assured her of his love , because he saw that that alone could pacify her now , and did not reproach her with words , though he reproached her in his heart .
And those assurances of love , which to him appeared so trivial that he felt ashamed to utter them , she drank in and gradually became calm .
Next day , fully reconciled , they left for the country .
DOLLY AND HER CHILDREN WERE SPENDING THE SUMMER with her sister Kitty at Pokrovsk .
The house on her own estate was quite dilapidated , so Levin and his wife persuaded her to spend the summer with them .
Oblonsky quite approved of this arrangement .
Only one of his relatives , Sergius Ivanich , visited him that summer - and he was a man of the Koznyshev type and not a Levin , so that the Levin spirit was quite overwhelmed .
And Kitty , who conducted her household with great assiduity , had no little trouble to procure all the chickens , turkeys , and ducks , of which , with the visitors ' and the children 's summer appetites very many were required .
The whole family was assembled at dinner .
'You must take me too !
I am very fond of looking for mushrooms , ' he said with a glance at Varenka . ' I consider it a very good occupation . ' 
'Why , certainly ! We shall be very pleased , ' replied Varenka with a blush .
The intellectual and learned Koznyshev 's offer to go and gather mushrooms with Varenka confirmed a suspicion that had greatly occupied Kitty 's mind of late .
She hastened to say something to her mother so that her glance should pass unnoticed .
After dinner Koznyshev sat down by the drawing @-@ room window , continuing his conversation with his brother over a cup of coffee and glancing now and then at the door through which the children , who were preparing to set out on the mushroom hunt , would enter .
Kitty stood near her husband , evidently waiting for the end of the conversation - which did not interest her - before speaking to him .
'Kate , it is not good for you to be standing , ' said her husband , with a meaning look , moving a chair toward her .
'Ah , well ! there 's no time now , ' added Koznyshev as the children came running in .
In advance of them all , at a sideways gallop , came Tanya in tightly pulled @-@ up stockings , running toward Koznyshev , flourishing a basket and his hat .
'Varenka is waiting , ' she said , carefully placing his hat on his head when she saw from his smile that she had permission to do so .
Varenka , who was wearing a yellow print dress and a white kerchief on her head , stood in the doorway .
'I 'm coming , Mlle Varenka , ' said Koznyshev , drinking up his coffee and pocketing his handkerchief and cigarcase .
'What a darling my Varenka is , eh ? '
Kitty said to her husband as soon as Koznyshev had risen .
She said it so that the latter could hear , with an evident desire that he should do so . ' And how handsome , how nobly handsome ! ...
Varenka ! ' she exclaimed . ' You will be in the wood by the mill ?
We will drive there . ' 
'You quite forget your condition , Kitty , ' said the old Princess , hurrying in . ' You should not shout so . ' 
Varenka , hearing Kitty 's voice and her mother reprimanding her , came up with her light step .
The quickness of Varenka 's movements , the colour suffusing her animated face , all showed that something unusual was taking place within her .
Kitty knew what that unusual thing was , and watched her attentively .
She had now called Varenka only to give her a silent blessing for the important event which , according to Kitty , was to happen in the woods that day after dinner .
'Varenka , I shall be very happy if a certain thing comes to pass , ' she whispered , kissing her .
'And are you coming with us ? ' Varenka , quite confused , asked Levin , pretending not to have heard what had been said to her .
'I must look at the new waggons , and count them , ' said Levin . ' And where will you be ? '
They always liked to sit there after dinner but to @-@ day they had special business there .
'Steve says it 's better to give them money , ' Dolly remarked , returning to the interesting topic of what presents it was best to give to the servants , ' but ... '
'How can one give them money ! ' said the Princess and Kitty with one voice . ' They value presents so ! '
'Well , I for instance got our Matrena Semenovna not exactly poplin , but something of that kind , last year , ' said the Princess .
'Yes , I remember she wore it on your Name day . ' 
'The pattern is charming - so simple and refined .
I would have had one made like it myself if she hadn 't had it .
It is something like Varenka 's , and so pretty and cheap . ' 
'Well , I think it is ready now , ' said Dolly , dripping syrup from the spoon .
'When it begins to string , it is ready .
'Oh , these flies ! ' cried Agatha Mikhaylovna crossly . ' It will come out just the same . ' 
'Oh , how sweet he is - don 't frighten him ! ' exclaimed Kitty unexpectedly , looking at a sparrow that had settled on the railing , turned a raspberry stalk over , and was pecking at it .
'Yes , but keep away from the brazier , ' said her mother .
'A propos de Varenka , ' said Kitty in French , which they had been talking all the time so that Agatha Mikhaylovna should not understand them . ' Do you know , Mama , I am somehow expecting it to be settled to @-@ day !
You understand what I mean .
How nice it would be ! '
'What am I to think ?
She is very good @-@ natured , but he might ... '
'Oh , but , Mama , try and understand why nothing better could be imagined either for him or for her .
First of all , she is simply charming ! ' expostulated Kitty , crooking one finger .
'He certainly likes her very much , ' Dolly chimed in .
'Secondly , his position in the world is such that neither property nor the social position of his wife matters to him at all .
'Yes , one certainly can trust her , ' again chimed in Dolly .
'Thirdly , she must love him ; and that too is ...
In a word , it would be splendid !
I expect when they come back from the wood it will all be settled .
What do you think , Dolly ? '
'But don 't get excited ; there is no need at all for you to get excited , ' admonished her mother .
I think he will propose to @-@ day . ' 
'Ah , how strange it is when and how a man proposes ...
There is a sort of barrier , and suddenly down it goes , ' said Dolly with a dreamy smile , recalling her past with Oblonsky .
'There was nothing special about it - it was quite simple , ' answered the Princess , but her face brightened at the memory .
You really loved him before you were allowed to talk to one another ? '
Kitty felt a particular charm in being able now to talk with her mother as an equal about those chief events in a woman 's life .
'Of course he loved me ; he used to visit us in the country . ' 
'But how was it decided , Mama ? '
'How well you put it , mama !
'What words did Constantine say to you ? '
'He wrote with chalk .
How long ago it seems ! ' she replied .
And the three women meditated silently on the same subject .
She recalled the whole of the winter preceding her marriage and her infatuation with Vronsky .
'There 's one thing ... that old love @-@ affair of Varenka 's , ' she said , following the natural sequence of her thoughts . ' I wished to tell Koznyshev somehow , to prepare him .
'Not all , ' said Dolly . ' You judge by your own husband .
He is still tormented by the memory of Vronsky .
'You are , ' answered Kitty , her eyes smiling dreamily .
'But I do not know , ' interposed the Princess , defending her maternal watchfulness over her daughter , ' what there is in your past to trouble him !
That Vronsky courted you ?
Such things happen to every girl . ' 
'No , excuse me ! ' her mother continued . ' And then you yourself would not let me talk it over with Vronsky .
'Oh Mama ! ' said Kitty , looking pained .
'Nowadays one can 't hold you girls in ...
Your relations with him could not have gone beyond what was proper , else I should have spoken to him myself !
However , my love , it won 't do for you to get agitated .
Please remember that and keep calm . ' 
'How happily it turned out for Kitty that Anna came , ' said Dolly , ' and how unhappily for her !
The exact reverse , ' she added , struck by her thought . ' Then Anna was so happy and Kitty considered herself miserable .
I often think of her . ' 
'She 's not worth thinking about !
A horrid , disgusting woman without a heart , ' said their mother , unable to forget that Kitty had not married Vronsky but Levin .
'About what don 't you want to think ? ' he asked as he came up .
For an instant he felt that he shared Agatha Mikhaylovna 's dissatisfaction that the jam was boiled without water , and with the alien Shcherbatsky influence in general .
He smiled , however , and went up to Kitty .
'Well ? ' he asked , looking at her with the expression with which every one addressed her nowadays .
'Quite all right , ' replied Kitty with a smile . ' And your affairs ? '
'The waggons 'll hold three times as much as peasant carts .
'What ? Are you going to take Kitty in the trap ? ' said her mother reproachfully .
Levin never called the Princess Maman , as sons @-@ in @-@ law usually do , and this displeased the Princess .
But though he liked and respected her very much , Levin could not address her so without violating his feeling for his dead mother .
'I don 't wish to see such unreasonable doings . ' 
'Well , then I 'll go on foot !
'Well , Agatha Mikhaylovna , is the jam done ? ' asked Levin , smiling at her and wishing to cheer her up . ' Has it turned out well the new way ? '
'I suppose so .
'You need not comfort me , ma 'am !
'Come with us and get mushrooms ! You will show us the right places . ' Agatha Mikhaylovna smiled and shook her head , as much as to say : ' Though I should like to be cross with you , I can 't do it . ' 
'Please follow my advice , ' said the old Princess , ' cover the jam with paper soaked in rum , and then it will not get mouldy , even without ice . ' 
They had nothing to say to one another , but he wanted to hear the sound of her voice , which like her look had been changed by pregnancy .
In her voice as in her look there was now a certain softness and seriousness , as of a person continually intent on one beloved task .
Lean more on me , ' he said .
'No . I am so glad of a chance to be alone with you ; and I own that , nice as it is to have them all , I regret our winter evenings alone together . ' 
'They were pleasant , but this is still better .
Both are better , ' he said , pressing her hand .
'Do you know what we were talking about when you came in ? '
'About the jam ? '
'Yes , about jam , and then ... about how people propose . ' 
'And about Sergius and Varenka .
I want it so much , ' she went on . ' What do you think about it ? ' and she looked into his face .
'I don 't know what to think , ' Levin replied with a smile . ' Sergius seems very strange to me in that regard .
'Yes - that he was in love with that girl who died ... '
'It happened when I was still a child ; I only knew of it from what I was told .
I remember him at that time .
He was wonderfully charming .
But since then I have observed him with women : he is amiable and some of them please him , but I feel that for him they are simply human beings , not women . ' 
'Yes , but now with Varenka ? ...
There seems to be something ... '
He is a peculiar , a wonderful man .
He lives only a spiritual life .
Would that lower him ? '
'No , but he is so used to living a purely spiritual life that he cannot reconcile himself to realities , and , after all , Varenka is a reality ! '
'Yes , but in her there is not so much of that reality as there is in me , I know he would never have loved me .
'Oh no ! He is very fond of you , and it is always such a pleasure to me when my people are fond of you . ' 
'You think he can 't fall in love , then ? ' said Kitty , putting his thoughts into her own words .
'Not exactly that he can 't fall in love , ' Levin answered with a smile , ' but he has none of that weakness which is necessary ...
'You envy him because he can 't fall in love ? '
'I envy him because he is better than I am , ' replied he , smiling . ' He does not live for himself .
And so he can be calm and contented . ' 
'And you ? ' said Kitty with a mocking smile of loving amusement .
She could not have expressed the sequence of thoughts that made her smile , but the last deduction was that her husband , in extolling his brother and depreciating himself , was not quite sincere .
What are you dissatisfied with ? ' she said with the same smile .
Her disbelief in his dissatisfaction with himself was pleasant , and unconsciously he challenged her to give reasons for her disbelief .
'I am happy , but dissatisfied with myself ... ' he answered .
'How can you be dissatisfied if you are happy ? '
'I mean ... How shall I put it ? ...
In my heart I wish for nothing more , except that you shouldn 't stumble . Oh dear !
'In what way ? ' asked she , still smiling . ' Don 't you do anything for others ?
'No . I feel it now more than ever - and it is your fault , ' he answered , pressing her arm , ' that it 's not the right thing .
I do it , but it is superficial .
If I could love all that work as I love you ... but of late I have been doing it like a task set me ... '
'Well then , what do you say to Papa ? ' asked Kitty . ' Is he bad too , because he does nothing for the common good ? '
But one must have your father 's simplicity , clearness , and kindness , and have I got all that ?
I don 't act and I worry .
'Then would you now like to change places with Sergius Ivanich ? ' asked Kitty . ' Would you prefer to do that public work , and love that given task as he does , and nothing more ? '
'Of course not ! ' replied Levin . ' However , I am so happy that I don 't understand anything ...
So you think he will propose to @-@ day ? ' he added after a pause .
'He will , he won 't , ' said Levin , pulling off the veined white petals .
'No , no ! ' exclaimed she , watching his fingers excitedly as she seized his hand to stop him . ' You 've pulled off two at once . ' 
'Well then , we won 't count this tiny one , ' said he , picking off a short ill @-@ formed petal . ' And here 's the trap overtaking us . ' 
VARENKA WITH THE WHITE KERCHIEF OVER HER BLACK HAIR , surrounded by the children and good @-@ naturedly and cheerfully busy with them , and evidently excited by the possibility of an offer of marriage from a man she liked , looked very attractive .
Koznyshev walked by her side and did not cease admiring her .
'If it is so , I must think it over and come to a decision , and not let myself be carried away like a boy by the impulse of the moment , ' he told himself .
When he had gone some forty paces he stepped behind a spindle bush with pink and red earring @-@ shaped blossoms , and paused , knowing that he could no longer be seen .
Around him everything was quiet .
Suddenly , from the skirts of the wood not far off , he heard Varenka 's contralto voice calling to Grisha , and a smile of pleasure lit up his face .
Conscious of that smile , Koznyshev shook his head disapprovingly at his own state and taking out a cigar began to light it .
He was long unable to strike a match against the bark of a birch .
The delicate white outer bark adhered to the phosphorus , and the light went out .
Watching the sheet of smoke , he went on slowly , meditating on his condition of mind .
But it is nothing of the kind . The one thing I can find against it is that when I lost Marie I told myself that I would remain true to her memory .
That is the only thing I can say against my feeling ...
'But , apart from that , however much I searched I could find nothing to say against my feeling .
If I had chosen by reason alone , I could find nothing better ! '
She had all the charm and freshness of youth but was no longer a child , and if she loved him , loved him consciously as a woman ought to love . That was one favourable consideration .
The third was : she was religious , not irresponsibly religious and kind @-@ hearted like a child - like Kitty for instance but her life was based on religious convictions .
And this girl , uniting all the qualities , loved him .
He was modest , but could not help being aware of this .
And he loved her .
One of the opposite arguments was his age .
And what was the use of counting by years , when he felt as young at heart as he had been twenty years ago ?
His heart leapt with joy .
He felt that the matter was decided .
Varenka , who had bent to pick a mushroom , rose buoyantly and glanced round .
Throwing away his cigar Koznyshev went toward her with resolute steps .
'MLLE VARENKA ! WHEN VERY YOUNG I formed my ideal of the woman I should love and whom I should be happy to call my wife .
I have lived many years , and now in you for the first time I have met what I was in search of .
I love you , and offer you my hand . ' 
This was what Koznyshev said to himself when he was already within ten steps of Varenka .
Kneeling and with outstretched arms defending some mushrooms from Grisha , she was calling little Masha .
'Come along , little ones !
There are a lot here , ' she cried in her delightful mellow voice .
On seeing Koznyshev approaching she did not move ; yet everything told him that she felt his approach and was glad of it .
'Well , have you found anything ? ' she asked from beneath her white kerchief , turning her handsome face toward him , with a gentle smile .
'Not one , ' said Koznyshev . ' And you ? '
She did not reply , being busy with the children who surrounded her .
'There 's another , near the branch , ' she said , pointing to a small mushroom cut across its firm pinkish crown by a dry blade of grass from beneath which it had sprung up .
Varenka rose when Masha had picked the mushroom , breaking it into two white pieces . ' It reminds me of my childhood , ' she added , moving away from the children with Koznyshev .
They went a few paces in silence .
Varenka saw that he wanted to speak , and guessing the subject she grew faint with joy and fear .
They had gone far enough not to be overheard , but he still had not begun .
It would have been easier after a silence to say what they wished to say than after talking about mushrooms ; yet against her will , and as if by accident , she said :
'So you have not found anything ?
Koznyshev sighed and did not speak .
He was vexed that she had spoken about mushrooms .
'I have only heard that the white boleti grow chiefly on the outskirts , but I can 't even tell which are the white ones . ' 
A few more minutes passed ; they had gone still further from the children and were quite alone .
Varenka 's heart beat so that she seemed to hear it , and she felt herself growing red and then pale and red again .
To be the wife of a man like Koznyshev after her difficult life with Madame Stahl seemed to her the height of bliss .
Besides , she was almost sure she loved him , and now in a moment it must be decided .
She was frightened : frightened of what he might or might not say .
'He must make his declaration now or never ' ; Koznyshev also felt this .
Everything - Varenka 's look , her blush , her downcast eyes - betrayed painful expectation .
He saw it and was sorry for her .
He even felt that to say nothing now would be to offend her .
His mind went rapidly over all the arguments in favour of his decision .
He repeated to himself the words with which he had intended to propose ; but instead of those words some unexpected thought caused him to say :
Varenka 's lips trembled with emotion when she replied :
'The stem of the birch @-@ tree boletus reminds one of a dark man 's beard two days old , ' remarked Koznyshev calmly .
'Yes , that 's true , ' answered Varenka with a smile , and involuntarily the direction of their stroll changed .
They began to return to the children .
Varenka felt pained and ashamed , but at the same time she experienced a sense of relief .
He could not be unfaithful to Marie 's memory .
'Gently , gently , children ! ' shouted Levin almost angrily , stepping in front of his wife to shield her , when the crowd of children came rushing at them with shrieks of delight .
Behind the children Koznyshev and Varenka came out of the wood .
Kitty had no need to question Varenka : from the calm and rather shamefaced look on both faces she knew that her plan had not been realized .
'Well ? ' inquired her husband on their way home .
'Won 't bite , ' answered Kitty with a smile and manner of speaking like her father , which Levin often observed in her with pleasure .
'Like this , ' she said , taking her husband 's hand , raising it to her mouth , and slightly touching it with her closed lips . ' As one kisses the bishop 's hand . ' 
'Who won 't bite ? ' said he , laughing .
And it should have been like this ... '
They both experienced what is felt by a pupil who has failed in an examination and has to remain in the same class or be finally expelled from the school .
Levin and Kitty felt particularly happy and in love with one another that evening .
Their happiness in their love involved an unpleasant reflection on those who desired , but had failed , to secure the same happiness , and made them feel ashamed .
They were expecting Oblonsky by the evening train , and the old Prince had written that he would perhaps accompany him .
'And I know why , ' continued the Princess . ' He says young married folk should be left to themselves for a while . ' 
We have not seen him ... And are we young married folk ? ...
'Only if he doesn 't come I too shall say good @-@ bye to you children , ' said the Princess with a sorrowful sigh .
And suddenly the old Princess 's voice unexpectedly quavered .
'Mama always finds something sad , ' this glance seemed to say .
'What is it , Agatha Mikhaylovna ? ' Kitty asked suddenly when the old woman stopped in front of her with a look of mystery and importance .
'Oh , that 's just right , ' said Dolly . ' You go and give your orders , and I will hear Grisha his lesson .
He hasn 't done anything today . ' 
'That 's a rebuke for me !
No , Dolly ! I will go , ' said Levin , jumping up .
So he went on teaching Grisha not in his own way but according to the book , and therefore did it half @-@ heartedly and often missed a lesson .
So it had happened that day .
Varenka spoke in the same way to Kitty .
Even in the Levins ' well @-@ ordered household she found ways to be of use . ' I will see about supper , ' she said , ' and you stay here ' ; and she rose to accompany Agatha Mikhaylovna .
'Yes , do . I expect they could not get any chickens , but there are our own ... ' answered Kitty .
'Agatha Mikhaylovna and I will arrange it , ' and Varenka went out with the old woman .
'What a nice girl ! ' said the Princess .
'Not nice , Mama , but so charming that there is no one else like her ! '
'Mama , he will do all that 's necessary and will agree to everything , ' interpolated Kitty , annoyed with her mother for asking Koznyshev 's opinion on such a matter .
Dolly had not had time to rise to go to meet her husband , before Levin had jumped out of the window of the room below , where he had been teaching Grisha , and had lifted the boy out too .
'It 's Steve ! ' shouted Levin from under the balcony . ' We have finished , Dolly , don 't worry ! ' he added , running like a boy to meet the carriage .
'Is , ea , id ; ejus , ejus , ejus , ' shouted Grisha , hopping down the avenue .
It must be Papa ! ' shouted Levin , who had stopped at the bend of the avenue . ' Kitty , don 't come down those steep steps , go round ! '
But Levin was mistaken in supposing that one of the men in the calèche was the old Prince .
When he came nearer he saw , sitting beside Oblonsky , a stout handsome young man wearing a Scotch bonnet with long ribbons streaming behind .
It was Vasenka Veslovsky , a second cousin of the Shcherbatskys , a brilliant Petersburg @-@ Moscow young man . ' A most splendid fellow and a passionate sportsman , ' as Oblonsky said when he introduced him .
Levin did not get in , but followed the calèche .
He was rather vexed that the old Prince , whom he liked more and more the better he knew him , had not come , and vexed because this Vasenka Veslovsky , a quite superfluous stranger , had come .
'We , your wife and I , are cousins and old acquaintances , ' said Vasenka Veslovsky , once again giving Levin 's hand a very , very hard squeeze .
'Well , is there any game ? ' asked Oblonsky of Levin scarcely giving himself time to say a word of greeting to everybody . ' He and I have the cruellest intentions ...
Why , mama ! They have not been in Moscow since then ....
Here , Tanya ! That 's for you ! ...
Levin , who but a few moments before had been in the brightest of spirits , was now looking dismally at every one , dissatisfied with everything .
'Whom was he kissing yesterday with those same lips ? ' he thought as he looked at Oblonsky caressing his wife .
He looked at Dolly , and was not pleased with her either .
'Of course she does not believe in his love .
Disgusting ! ' thought he .
And Varenka too seemed disgusting because of the manner in which she with her sainte nitouche [ Holy unapproachable . ] air made that gentleman 's acquaintance , while all her thought was how to get married .
Talking noisily , they all went into the house , but as soon as all were seated Levin turned and left the room .
Kitty noticed that something was wrong with her husband .
She tried to seize an opportune moment to speak to him alone ; but he hurried away from her , saying that he must go to the office .
It was long since the farm work had seemed so important to him as it did that evening .
'For them it is always a holiday , ' he thought , ' yet here we have work that is no holiday task , which cannot be put off , and without which life is impossible . ' 
LEVIN DID NOT RETURN until they called him to supper .
On the stairs stood Kitty and Agatha Mikhaylovna , deliberating what wines to serve .
'But why all this fuss ?
'No ; Steve does not drink it ...
'Well then , shall we go shooting to @-@ morrow ? ' Oblonsky inquired .
'Yes ! Do let 's go ! ' cried Veslovsky , changing from one chair to another and sitting sideways with one of his fat legs doubled under him .
'I shall be very pleased ! Let 's go .
Will it tire you ?
Aren 't you tired , Steve ? '
Let 's not go to bed at all !
'Yes , really ! Don 't let us go to bed ! Delightful ! ' chimed in Veslovsky .
'Oh no , stay here , Dolly dear ! ' said Oblonsky , stepping across to her side of the long supper @-@ table . ' I have much more to tell you . ' 
'Do you know , Veslovsky has been to see Anna ?
And he is going there again .
You know it 's only some seventy versts off .
Veslovsky , come here ! '
Vasenka came over to the ladies , and took a seat beside Kitty .
'Oh , do tell me ! You have been to see her ?
Levin remained at the other end of the table , and while not ceasing to talk with the Princess and Varenka saw that Oblonsky , Dolly , Kitty , and Veslovsky were carrying on an animated and mysterious conversation .
Moreover , he saw his wife had an expression of serious feeling as she gazed attentively at Vasenka 's handsome face while he was vivaciously narrating something .
'It 's very nice at their place , ' Vasenka was saying , talking of Vronsky and Anna . ' Of course I do not take it upon myself to judge , but in their house one feels oneself to be in a family . ' 
'What do they mean to do ? '
'I believe they mean to go to Moscow for the winter . ' 
'How nice it would be for us to meet there !
'I shall spend July with them . ' 
'And will you go ? ' Oblonsky asked his wife .
I shall go alone when you are away , and won 't inconvenience anyone .
'That 's all right , ' replied he ; ' and you , Kitty ? '
Why should I go ? ' said Kitty , flushing deeply and glancing round at her husband .
'Are you acquainted with Anna Arkadyevna ? ' Veslovsky asked her . ' She is very attractive . ' 
'So you are off shooting to @-@ morrow ? ' she asked .
Levin 's jealousy during those few minutes had gone far , especially after the blush that had suffused her face when speaking to Veslovsky .
Now as he listened to her question he interpreted it in his own way .
'Yes , I am going , ' he answered in an unnatural voice that was disagreeable to himself .
'No , wait a day , because Dolly has seen nothing of her husband . You could go the day after to @-@ morrow , ' said she .
Levin now interpreted her words thus : ' Do not part me from him .
Your going does not matter to me , but do let me enjoy the society of this charming young man ! '
'Oh , if you wish it we will stay at home to @-@ morrow , ' replied Levin with particular amiability .
Meanwhile Vasenka , without the least suspicion of the sufferings his presence was causing , rose from the table after Kitty and followed her , smiling pleasantly .
Levin saw that smile .
He grew pale and for a moment could hardly breathe .
'How dare he look like that at my wife ! ' he thought , boiling with rage .
Please let 's go ! ' said Vasenka , sitting down and once more doubling his leg under him , as his habit was .
Levin 's jealousy rose still higher .
Already he fancied himself a deceived husband , necessary to his wife and her lover only to provide them with the comforts of life and with pleasures ...
But nevertheless he asked Vasenka in an amiable and hospitable manner about his shooting , his gun , his boots - and agreed to go shooting next day .
Happily for Levin the old Princess put a stop to his sufferings by herself getting up and advising Kitty to go to bed .
But he did not escape a fresh pang .
Taking leave of his hostess , Vasenka again wanted to kiss her hand ; but Kitty , blushing , drew away her hand , and said with naive rudeness , for which she was afterwards reprimanded by her mother :
In Levin 's eyes Kitty was to blame for having laid herself open to such behaviour , and still more to blame for so awkwardly showing that it displeased her .
Do you know he has a fine voice ? We have been rehearsing on the way .
He has brought some beautiful songs - two new ones .
After the rest had separated for the night Oblonsky long walked in the avenue with Veslovsky , and their voices could be heard practising a new song .
He stood before her , his eyes glittering terribly under his frowning brows , and pressed his powerful arms to his breast , as if trying with all his might to restrain himself .
The expression of his face would have been hard and even cruel , but for a look of suffering which touched her .
His jaw trembled and his voice faltered .
'Understand that I am not jealous : that is a vile word !
I cannot be jealous nor believe that ...
I cannot say what I feel , but it is dreadful ...
I am not jealous , but I am offended and humiliated that anyone dares imagine - dares look at you with such eyes ... '
'What eyes ? ' said Kitty , trying to remember as honestly as she could all the words and gestures of the evening and all their shades of meaning .
'And what attraction can there be about me as I am ... '
'Ah ! ' he exclaimed , seizing his head in his hands . ' You had better not say anything ! ...
They don 't ! They don 't ! ...
Well then , would you like me not to see anybody ? '
'Try and understand the horror and absurdity of my position , ' he continued in a despairing whisper . ' He is in my house , and strictly speaking he has done nothing improper except by his free and easy manner and doubling up his legs !
He considers it to be in the best form , and therefore I have to be polite to him ! '
'Come , Kostya , you are exaggerating ! ' remonstrated Kitty , at the bottom of her heart pleased by the force of love for her which was now expressing itself in his jealousy .
'The worst of it all is that you - are as you always are , and now when you are my holy of holies and we are so happy - so specially happy - suddenly this good @-@ for @-@ nothing comes along ...
But our happiness , mine and yours ... why ... ? '
'Do you know , I see how it happened ... ' Kitty began .
'How ? How ? '
'I noticed your look while we were talking at supper . ' 
She told him what they had been talking about , and while she spoke she was breathless with excitement .
'Kate , I have been tormenting you !
It was madness !
How could I torture myself like that about such nonsense ? '
Because I am a madman !
It is dreadful to think that a mere stranger can destroy our bliss ! '
'Of course , and that is what offends me ... '
'Well then , I will keep him here all the summer on purpose . I will lavish attentions on him , ' said Levin , kissing her hands .
At length the door opened noisily and out bounded , spinning round and round in the air , Krak , Oblonsky 's yellow spotted pointer , followed by Oblonsky himself with a gun in his hand and a cigar in his mouth .
'Quiet , quiet , Krak ! ' he said affectionately to the dog , which was throwing its paws up against his stomach and chest and getting them entangled in his game @-@ bag .
Vasenka had been ignorant that the stylishness of a real sportsman consists in being dressed in rags but having one 's shooting implements of the very best quality .
'He has a young wife , ' answered Oblonsky , with a smile .
'Sorry , gentlemen ! ' he said , running out on to the porch . ' Is the lunch put in ?
'Let them out with the flock , ' he said , turning to the herdsman who was waiting for orders about some young sheep . ' Sorry ! There 's another rascal coming . ' 
Levin jumped down from the cart where he had already seated himself , to meet the carpenter who was approaching with a sazhen measure in his hand .
'Won 't you have one more turning made ?
Three more steps will be enough , then we 'll get it exact .
'You should have obeyed me , ' said Levin with vexation . ' I told you to set up the string @-@ boards first , and then to make the grooves .
Do as I tell you and make a new one . ' 
Now he wanted to use that staircase , adding three steps to it .
'But where will it reach to with three additional steps ? '
'Excuse me , sir ! ' said the carpenter , smiling contemptuously . ' It will reach to the exact spot .
'Why , but three steps will add to its length as well ... Where will it get to ? '
'It will go up from the bottom , I mean , and reach to the top , ' the carpenter repeated obstinately and persuasively .
Levin pulled out his ramrod and drew the staircase in the dust .
'As you please , ' said the carpenter , his eyes suddenly brightening ; evidently he had at last understood . ' It seems we 'll have to make another . ' 
'Well then , do as I told you , ' Levin shouted as he climbed into the cart . ' Drive on !
Hold the dogs , Philip ! '
Having- left the cares of home and estate behind him , Levin experienced such a strong sense of the joy of life and anticipation , that he felt disinclined to talk .
Besides , he experienced that feeling of concentrated excitement which every sportsman knows when approaching the scene of action .
'If only I don 't disgrace myself before that stranger !
If only Oblonsky 's shooting does not beat mine ! ' was his thought .
Oblonsky shared these feelings and was likewise not talkative .
Vasenka Veslovsky alone chattered incessantly and merrily .
Now , as he listened to him , Levin felt ashamed of his injustice toward him the day before .
Vasenka was really a good sort , simple , kind @-@ hearted , and very jolly .
Had Levin come across him when still a bachelor , they would have become intimate .
Levin did not quite like his holiday outlook on life and a sort of free and easy stylishness about him .
When they had gone about three versts , Veslovsky suddenly missed his cigars and pocket @-@ book , and did not know whether he had lost them or left them on his table .
He had three hundred and seventy roubles in the pocket @-@ book , and therefore the matter could not be ignored .
'Do you know , Levin , I will gallop home on this Don side @-@ horse !
That will be grand , eh ? ' he said , preparing to get out .
'No , why ? ' replied Levin , conjecturing that Veslovsky must weigh not less than fifteen stone . ' I will send the coachman . ' 
So the coachman rode back on the side @-@ horse and Levin drove the other two himself .
'WELL , WHERE ARE WE GOING ?
Tell us all about it , ' said Oblonsky .
'The plan is this . We are now going as far as Gvozdevo .
'And is there nothing by the way ? '
Levin himself felt inclined to stop at those little places , but , as they were near home , they were always within his reach and they were small , so that there was not room enough for three persons to shoot there .
So he stretched a point and said they would hardly find anything there .
When they came to a small marsh he wished to drive past it , but Oblonsky , with the practised eye of a sport man , noticed the marshy place from the road .
'Oughtn 't we to go there ? ' he asked , pointing to the marsh .
'Levin , do let us ! How delightful ! ' begged Vasenka Veslovsky , and Levin could not but agree .
Scarcely had they stopped before the dogs flew toward the marsh , racing one another .
The dogs returned .
Come along , Levin , let 's go together , ' said Veslovsky .
You don 't want two dogs ? '
Levin remained with the trap and looked enviously at the sportsmen .
They went over the whole marsh , but there was nothing there except waterfowl and some peewits , one of which Veslovsky killed .
'There , you see I was not grudging you the marsh ! ' said Levin . ' It only meant losing time . ' 
You saw ? ' said Vasenka Veslovsky , climbing awkwardly into the cart with his gun and the peewit . ' How well I got this one !
Well , shall we soon get to the real place ? '
Suddenly the horses started , Levin knocked his head against the barrel of some one 's gun , and there was a report .
Actually the report came first , but to Levin it seemed the other way about .
What had happened was , that Vasenka Veslovsky when uncocking his gun had pulled one trigger while uncocking the other side .
The charge went into the ground without hurting anyone .
Oblonsky shook his head and laughed reproachfully at Veslovsky .
When they reached the second marsh , which was of considerable size and would take a good deal of time Levin tried to dissuade them from getting out .
But again Veslovsky persuaded him , and again , the marsh being a narrow one , Levin as a hospitable host remained with the vehicles .
Krak immediately went toward the hummocks .
Vasenka Veslovsky was the first to follow the dog .
Before Oblonsky had time to approach , a snipe rose .
Veslovsky missed it , and it flew over to an unmown meadow .
The bird was left to Veslovsky .
Krak found it again and pointed . Veslovsky killed the bird and went back to the vehicles .
'Now you go , and I will remain with the horses , ' he said .
He handed the reins to Veslovsky and went into the marsh .
Laska , who had long been whining plaintively , as if complaining of the injustice , rushed straight forward to a likely spot covered with hummocks and known to Levin , where Krak had not yet been .
'Why don 't you stop her ? ' shouted Oblonsky .
'She won 't disturb them , ' answered Levin , pleased with his dog and hurrying after her .
Laska became more and more intent on her pursuit , the nearer she got to the hummocks .
A small marsh bird only diverted her attention for an instant .
Picking his way , he approached the dog .
'Seize it ! '
It was not a double @-@ snipe but a snipe that rose before the dog .
Levin knew he was aiming behind the snipe , but fired , nevertheless .
After making sure he had missed , he turned and saw that the trap and horses were no longer on the road but in the marsh .
Without a word of reply to Vasenka , who was assuring him that it was quite dry there , Levin worked silently with the coachman to disengage the horses .
When everything was in order and the vehicles had been brought back to the road , Levin gave orders for lunch to be served .
VESLOVSKY DROVE SO FAST that they arrived at the marsh too soon , while it was still hot .
When they got to the real marsh , the object of their journey , Levin involuntarily wished to rid himself of Vasenka and go about unhindered .
'Well , what shall we do ... ?
It 's a splendid marsh , and I see there are hawks too , ' said Oblonsky , pointing at two large birds circling above the sedges . ' Where there are hawks , there is sure to be game . ' 
That 's the best place .
I once shot seventeen grouse there ...
'Well then , who goes to the left and who to the right ? ' asked Oblonsky . ' The space on the right is broader , so you two go there together , and I will keep to the left , ' he added with affected indifference .
We 'll make the best bag , ' chimed in Vasenka .
Levin could not avoid agreeing , and they separated .
Levin knew Laska 's method of search - careful and dubious ; he knew it , and expected to see a flight of snipe .
'Veslovsky , walk beside me - beside me ! ' he whispered with bated breath to his comrade , who was splashing in the water behind him , and the direction of whose gun , after the accidental shot by the Kolpensky marsh , involuntarily interested Levin .
'No , I don 't want to hamper you . Don 't trouble about me . ' 
Vasenka had fired into a flight of ducks that were circling above the marsh far out of range and were at that moment flying straight toward the sportsmen .
Levin had barely time to turn , before he heard the cry of a snipe , then another , and a third , and about eight more rose one after the other .
Oblonsky got one just as it was preparing to begin its zigzag flight , and the bird fell like a small lump into the bog .
While they were reloading another bird rose , and Veslovsky , who had finished reloading , fired two charges of small shot over the water .
Oblonsky picked up his two snipe and looked with sparkling eyes at Levin .
'Well , now let 's part , ' he said , and limping with his left foot , and holding his gun ready , he whistled to his dog and went off in one direction .
Levin and Veslovsky went in the other .
Levin , if his first shots were unsuccessful , always became excited and annoyed , and shot badly all the rest of the day .
So it was this time .
There were a great many snipe .
Levin hurried , grew impatient , and became more and more flurried , until at last he fired almost without hope of killing anything .
Even Laska seemed to feel this .
Shot followed shot .
Meanwhile from the opposite side of the marsh came not frequent but , as it seemed to Levin , significant reports from Oblonsky 's gun , followed almost every time by a cry to the dog , ' Krak ! Krak !
The snipe unceasingly circled above the sedges .
The cry near the ground and sound in the air came incessantly from every side . The snipe that had risen previously and had been flying about descended in front of the sportsmen .
Not two but dozens of hawks now soared above the marsh .
Half of those strips were already mown .
Though there was little hope of finding as many birds in the unmown strips as on the mown part , Levin , having promised Oblonsky to meet him , went with his companion farther on over the mown and unmown strips .
'Hullo you sportsmen ! ' shouted one of several peasants who were sitting beside a cart from which the horses had been taken out . ' Come and have something with us !
'Come along ! Never mind ! ' shouted a merry , bearded , red @-@ faced peasant ; showing a row of white teeth and holding aloft a greenish vodka bottle that glittered in the sunshine .
'Qu 'est @-@ ce qu 'ils disent ? ' [ What are they saying ? ] asked Veslovsky .
I should go and have a drink , ' said Levin , not quite disinterestedly , hoping that the vodka would tempt Veslovsky and lure him away .
'Why are they offering it ? '
Really , you should go to them .
'You come too ! ' shouted a peasant to Levin .
'Come !
Levin badly wanted a drink of vodka and a bit of bread .
He felt faint and could hardly drag his staggering legs out of the bog , and for an instant he was in doubt .
His weariness vanished , at once he went easily through the marsh toward the dog .
Just at his feet rose a snipe ; he fired and killed it . The dog continued pointing .
'Fetch it ! '
Another bird rose before the dog .
At last , after a disgraceful miss , he threw his gun , and hat on the ground .
'No ! I must pull myself together , ' he thought , picked up his gun and hat , called Laska to heel , and got out of the marsh .
When he reached a dry place he sat down on a hummock , took off his boot and emptied it , then went back to the marsh , drank a little of the rusty water , wetted the heated barrels and bathed his face and hands .
Feeling refreshed , he returned to the spot where a snipe had settled , firmly resolved not to get flurried .
He tried to keep calm , but the same thing happened again .
His finger pulled the trigger before he had taken aim .
He had only five birds in his bag when he came out of the marsh by the alder grove where he was to meet Oblonsky .
Before he saw him , he saw his dog .
Krak , quite black with smelly marsh slime , sprang out from beneath the upturned root of an alder with the air of a conqueror and sniffed at Laska .
Behind Krak , in the shade of the alders , appeared Oblonsky 's stately figure .
He came toward Levin red and perspiring , with his shirt unbuttoned , still limping as before .
You have been firing a good deal ! ' he said with a merry smile .
'And you ? ' asked Levin .
But there was no need to ask , for he already saw the full bag .
He had fourteen birds .
'A famous marsh !
I expect Veslovsky was in your way .
One dog for two people is inconvenient , ' said Oblonsky , to soften his triumph .
WHEN LEVIN AND OBLONSKY REACHED THE PEASANT 'S HUT where Levin used to put up , Veslovsky was there before them .
'I have only just got here .
Fancy ! They fed me and gave me drink .
What bread - wonderful !
And they positively would not take any money , and kept on saying , " No offence ! " or something of that sort . ' 
'Why should they take money ?
Do they keep vodka for sale ? ' said the soldier who had at last succeeded in dragging off one wet boot together with a blackened stocking .
Though it was already dusk , none of the sportsmen wanted to sleep .
After fluctuating between recollections and stories of the shooting , of dogs , and of other shooting parties , the talk reached a theme that interested all three .
Malthus was a well @-@ known railway magnate .
'I don 't understand you , ' said Levin , rising on his heap of hay . ' How is it that those people don 't disgust you ?
I understand that lunch with good claret is very nice , but is it possible that that very luxury does not disgust you ?
All those people , like the holders of our drink @-@ monopolies formerly , get their money in ways that earn contempt - they disregard that contempt - and afterwards , by means of what they have dishonestly earned , they buy off that contempt . ' 
'Perfectly true ! ' chimed in Vasenka Veslovsky . ' Perfectly true !
'Not at all ! ' Levin could hear that Oblonsky said this with a smile ; ' I simply don 't consider him more dishonest than any of the rich merchants or noblemen .
Is it work to get a concession and resell it ? '
'Of course it is work ' .
Work in this sense , that if it were not for him and others like him , there would be no railways . ' 
'But it is not work such as that of a peasant or a savant . ' 
'Granted ! But it is work in the sense that his activity yields results : railways .
But then you consider railways useless ! '
'That 's quite another question . I am prepared to admit that they are useful .
But every acquisition out of proportion to the toil contributed is dishonourable . ' 
Hardly were the monopolies stopped before railways and banks appeared : other means of acquiring wealth without work . ' 
'Well , all you say may be quite correct and ingenious ...
In fact I notice a quite unjustifiable hostility on the part of the public toward these men , and it seems to me that it is envy ... '
'Oh , no ! That 's not fair , ' said -Veslovsky . ' It can 't be envy , and there is something not clean in their business . ' 
Levin broke in . ' You say it is unjust for me to receive five thousand while the peasant gets only fifty roubles : that 's true .
It is an injustice and I feel it , but ... '
'Yes , indeed .
'Yes , you feel it , but you won 't give him your estate , ' said Oblonsky , purposely provoking Levin .
'I don 't give it away because nobody demands that of me , and if I wanted to I could not do it , ' replied Levin ; ' besides , there is no one to give it to . ' 
'Give it to this peasant ; he won 't refuse . ' 
'Yes , but how should I set about it ?
'I don 't know ; but if you are convinced that you have no right ... '
'I 'm not at all convinced .
On the contrary , I feel that I have no right to give it away , that I have duties toward the land and toward my family . ' 
'No , allow me - if you consider such inequality unjust , why don 't you act accordingly ? '
'But I do act so , only in a negative sense , in the sense that I will not seek to increase the inequality that exists between my position and theirs . ' 
'Yes , that is a sophistical explanation , ' put in Veslovsky . ' Oh , our host ! ' he said , addressing a peasant who had opened the creaking barn doors and was entering . ' So you are not asleep yet ? '
'No , how can I sleep ?
I thought you gentlemen were asleep , but then I heard you chatting .
She won 't bite ? ' he asked , cautiously stepping with bare feet .
'And where are you going to sleep ? '
'Why , the maid @-@ servants close by . ' 
'If only one could ... go without getting up ! ' said Oblonsky , stretching himself . ' It 's delightful to lie still . ' 
'Well , then I 'll go alone , ' said Veslovsky , rising quickly and putting on his boots . ' Good @-@ bye , gentlemen !
If it 's jolly I will call you .
You have treated me to game , and I won 't forget you ! '
'Isn 't he a fine fellow ? ' said Oblonsky when Veslovsky had gone out and the peasant had shut the doors after him .
'Yes , fine , ' answered Levin , continuing to think of the question they had been discussing .
It seemed to him that he had expressed his thoughts and feelings as clearly as he could , yet both the others - sincere and not stupid men - had agreed that he was comforting himself with sophistry .
This perturbed him .
'No ! If it were unjust , you could not use such advantages with pleasure ; at any rate I could not .
The chief thing for me is , not to feel guilty . ' 
'I say , hadn 't we really better go ? ' put in Oblonsky , evidently weary of the mental strain . ' We can 't go to sleep , you know .
The words he had used when he said he was acting justly in a negative sense occupied his mind .
'Is it possible that one can act justly only in a negative sense ? ' he asked himself .
'Hasn 't the fresh hay a strong scent ! ' remarked Oblonsky , sitting up . ' Nothing will make me sleep .
Vasenka is up to something out there .
Shan 't we go too ?
'No , I am not going , ' answered Levin .
'Maybe you are stopping here on principle ? ' said Oblonsky , smiling , as he searched in the dark for his cap .
'No , not on principle , but why should I go ? '
'D 'you know , you will bring trouble on yourself , ' said Oblonsky , having found his cap and getting up .
'Why ?
'Don 't I see how you have placed yourself with your wife ?
I heard you discussing as a question of first @-@ rate importance , whether you should go away shooting for two days or not !
That 's all very well for an idyll , but it can 't last a lifetime .
A man should be independent - he has his own masculine interests .
A man must be manly , ' said Oblonsky , opening the door .
'Is that to say , he should court the maid @-@ servants ? ' asked Levin .
My wife won 't be the worse for it , and I shall have a spree .
Nothing of that kind at home ; but you needn 't tie your hands . ' 
'Perhaps ! ' said Levin drily , and turned on his side . ' To @-@ morrow one should start early , and I shall wake no one but shall start at daybreak . ' 
Venez vite ! ' [ Gentlemen , come quickly . ] came the voice of Veslovsky , who had come back .
Charmante ! A perfect Gretchen , and I have already made her acquaintance .
Really , very pretty ! ' he said in such an approving way , as if she had been made pretty specially for him , and he was satisfied with the maker .
Levin pretended to be asleep , but Oblonsky , having put on his slippers and lit a cigar , left the barn , and their voices soon died away .
'Can it be only done in a negative sense ? ' Levin repeated to himself .
Well , perhaps Steve is right !
I am not manly with her , I have grown effeminate ...
Through his sleep he heard laughter and Veslovsky 's and Oblonsky 's merry talk .
He opened his eyes for an instant : they were standing chatting in the open doorway , brightly lit up by the moon which had now risen .
WAKING AT EARLY DAWN Levin tried to rouse his companions .
Vasenka , lying prone with one stockinged leg outstretched , was sleeping so soundly that it was impossible to get any answer out of him .
Oblonsky , half asleep , refused to budge so early .
Even Laska , sleeping curled into a ring on a corner of the hay heap , got up reluctantly , and lazily stretched and adjusted first one hind leg and then the other .
Only one of them was lazily eating oats , scattering them over the edge of the trough .
The outside world was still grey .
'Why have you risen so early , my dear ? ' said his aged hostess , who came out of her hut , addressing him cordially as a good old acquaintance .
Laska ran ahead gaily along the footpath , and Levin followed at a brisk pace , continually glancing at the sky .
He did not wish the sun to rise before he reached the marsh .
They were shocks of rye .
In the translucent stillness of the morning the slightest sounds were audible .
He looked close and saw another and a third .
They all came from behind the wattle fence of an apiary , and flying across the hemp @-@ field disappeared in the direction of the marsh .
Not far from them , three hobbled horses were moving about .
Laska walked beside her master , seeking permission to run forward and looking around .
Laska paused with a mocking look at the horses and a questioning one at Levin .
He stroked her , and whistled as a sign that she might now set off .
Here and there among the marsh mosses and docks , that smell was very strong ; but it was impossible to decide in which direction it grew stronger or weaker .
After inhaling the air with distended nostrils she knew at once that not their scent only but they themselves were there , before her , not one only but many of them .
She slackened speed .
They were there , but she could not yet determine exactly where .
To decide this she began working round in a circle , when her master 's voice disturbed her .
'Laska ! Here ! ' he said , pointing to the other side .
She stood still , as if asking him whether it would not be better to continue as she had begun ; but he repeated his command in a stern voice , pointing to a group of hummocks covered with water where there could not be anything .
She obeyed , pretending to search in order to please him , went over the whole place and then returned to the first spot and immediately scented them once more .
The shortness of her legs prevented her seeing anything before her , but from the scent she could tell that it was not five paces off .
She stood , more and more conscious of its presence and enjoying the anticipation .
Her rigid tail was outstretched , only its very tip twitching .
Her mouth was slightly open and her ears erect .
One of her ears had turned back while she ran , she breathed heavily but cautiously , and yet more cautiously looked toward her master , turning her eyes rather than her head .
He , with his familiar face but ever terrible eyes , came stumbling over the hummocks , but unusually slowly , she thought .
So it seemed to her , though in reality he was running .
Having come close up to her he looked beyond , and from his height saw with his eyes what she had found with her nose .
It sat with turned head , listening .
Then , just spreading its wings slightly and folding them again , it vanished round a corner with an awkward backward jerk .
'But I can 't go , ' thought she . ' Where should I go to ?
From here I scent them , but if I go forward I shall not know what I am doing , nor where they are nor who they are . ' 
But now he pushed her with his knee , saying in an excited whisper , ' Seize it , Laska ! Seize it ! '
'Well , if he wishes it , I will , but I can no longer answer for anything , ' . thought Laska , and rushed forward at full tilt between the hummocks .
She now scented nothing more , but only saw and heard without understanding anything .
Another rose behind Levin without waiting to be disturbed by the dog .
By the time Levin had turned toward it , it had already gone far : but his shot reached it .
After flying some twenty feet , the second snipe rose at an acute angle , and then , turning round and round like a ball , fell heavily on a dry spot .
'Now , things will go right , ' thought Levin , putting the warm fat snipe into his bag . ' Eh , Laska dear , will things go right ? '
When , having reloaded , Levin went on again , the sun , though still invisible because of the clouds , had already risen .
The moon had lost all her brilliancy and gleamed like a little cloud in the sky . Not a single star was any longer visible .
The bluish grasses had turned yellowish green .
Marsh birds were busy in the dew @-@ bespangled bushes that cast long shadows beside the brook .
A hawk had woke up and was sitting on a haycock , turning its head from side to side and looking discontentedly at the marsh .
The powder @-@ smoke spread like milk over the green grass .
A boy ran up to Levin .
'Uncle , there were ducks here yesterday ! ' he shouted , following Levin from afar .
And Levin felt increased pleasure in killing three snipe one after another within sight of this little boy , who expressed his approval .
THE SPORTSMAN 'S SAYING , that if you don 't miss your first beast or first bird your day will be successful was justified .
The tale was correct , and Oblonsky 's envy gratified Levin .
He was also pleased that on his return he found a messenger had already arrived from Kitty with a note .
'I am quite well and happy .
If you were uneasy about me , you may be quite at ease now .
I have a new bodyguard - Mary Vlasyevna , ' this was the midwife , a new and important personage in the Levins ' family life .
'She has come to see me and finds me perfectly well , and we have got her to stay till your return .
All are cheerful and well , so don 't hurry and even stay another day if your sport is good . ' 
These two joys , his successful shooting and the news from his wife , were so great that two small unpleasantnesses which occurred after the shooting were easy to disregard .
One was that the chestnut side @-@ horse , having evidently been overworked the previous day , was off its feed and seemed dull .
'It was overdriven yesterday , Constantine Dmitrich , ' he said . ' Why , it was driven hard for ten versts ! '
It turned out that there were no pies , nor even any chicken left !
'He has an appetite ! ' said Oblonsky , laughing and pointing to Vasenka Veslovsky . ' I don 't suffer from lack of appetite , but he 's quite surprising ... '
'Well , it can 't be helped ! ' said Levin , looking morosely at Veslovsky . ' Well then , bring me some beef , Philip ! '
'The beef has been eaten , and the bone was given to the dogs , ' answered Philip .
Later on , when he had satisfied his hunger with the milk , he felt ashamed of having shown annoyance to a stranger , and he began laughing at his hungry irritation .
In the evening they again went out shooting , when Veslovsky also killed some birds , and late at night they set off home .
The drive back was as merry as the drive out had been .
These words particularly amused Veslovsky .
'Altogether I am awfully pleased with our outing ...
And you , Levin ? '
'I am very pleased with it too , ' said Levin sincerely . He was glad not only to feel no hostility such as he had felt at home toward Vasenka Veslovsky ; but on the contrary to feel quite friendly toward him .
NEXT MORNING AT TEN O 'CLOCK Levin , having made the round of his farm , knocked at the door of Vasenka 's room .
'Entrez ! ' shouted Veslovsky . ' Excuse me - I have only just finished my ablutions , ' he said smiling , as he stood before Levin in his underclothes .
'Please don 't mind me , ' and Levin sat down by the window . ' Have you slept well ? '
'Like the dead !
What a day it is for shooting ! '
'What do you drink , tea or coffee ? '
I expect the ladies are already up ?
When they had walked round the garden , visited the stables , and even done some gymnastics together on the parallel bars , Levin returned to the house with his guest and entered the drawing @-@ room with him .
'We had fine sport , and so many new impressions ! ' said Veslovsky , approaching Kitty , who sat at the samovar . ' What a pity ladies are deprived of that pleasure . ' 
'Well , what of it ? He must say something to the mistress of the house , ' Levin told himself .
He again thought he noticed something in the smile and conquering air with which the visitor addressed Kitty .
The Princess , who sat at the other end of the table with Mary Vlasyevna and Oblonsky , called Levin and began a conversation about moving to Moscow for Kitty 's confinement and taking a house there .
But the Princess did not understand his feelings and attributed his unwillingness to think and speak about it to thoughtlessness and indifference , and therefore gave him no peace .
She was now commissioning Oblonsky to see about a house , and called Levin to her .
Do as you think best , ' he said .
'You must decide when you will move . ' 
I know that millions of children are born without Moscow and without doctors ; then why ... '
'But one can 't talk to Kitty about it !
Why , do you want me to frighten her ?
'I will do whatever you tell me to , ' he replied morosely .
The Princess began telling him , but he did not listen to her .
Though this talk with the Princess upset him , it was not that but what he saw by the samovar which made him morose .
'No , this is impossible , ' he thought , glancing occasionally at Vasenka , who was leaning toward Kitty and saying something , with his handsome smile , and at Kitty , blushing and agitated .
There was something impure in Vasenka 's attitude , his look and his smile .
Levin even saw something impure in Kitty 's pose and smile ; and again the light faded from his eyes .
Again , as on the previous occasion , he suddenly , without the least interval , felt thrown from the height of happiness , peace , and dignity into an abyss of despair , malevolence , and degradation .
Again everyone and everything became revolting to him .
'Well then , Princess , let it be just as you think best , ' he said , turning away .
' " Heavy is the Autocrat 's crown ! " [ A quotation from Pushkin 's Boris Godunov . ] said Oblonsky banteringly , evidently alluding not only to the Princess 's conversation , but also to the cause of Levin 's agitation , which he had observed . ' How late you are to @-@ day , Dolly ! '
Vasenka only rose for a moment , and with the absence of politeness to women which is characteristic of modern young men , barely bowed and again continued his conversation , laughing at something .
The conversation with Kitty begun by Vasenka again dealt with Anna and with the question whether love can rise above social conditions .
This conversation was unpleasant to Kitty and upset her , both by the subject itself and by the tone in which it was carried on , but especially because she already knew the effect it would have on her husband .
But she was too simple and innocent to know how to stop it , or even how to conceal the superficial pleasure which this young man 's evident attentions caused her .
She wished to put an end to the conversation , but did not know how .
Whatever she did , she knew , would be noticed by her husband and would all be construed into something wrong .
'Well , shall we go to pick mushrooms to @-@ day ? ' said Dolly .
This guilty look confirmed all his suspicions .
He went downstairs , but had not had time to leave his study before he heard his wife 's familiar footsteps following him with imprudent rapidity .
'What is it ? ' he asked drily . ' We are busy . ' 
'Excuse me , ' she said addressing the German mechanic , ' I have a few words to say to my husband . ' 
'The train is at three ? ' asked the German , ' I must not miss it . ' 
Levin did not answer him but went out with his wife .
'Well , what have you to say to me ? ' he asked in French .
He did not look her in the face and did not notice that she ( in her condition ) stood with her whole face twitching , and had a pitiful , crushed appearance .
'I ... I want to tell you that it 's impossible to live like this - it 's torture ! ' she muttered .
'The servants are there , in the pantry , ' he said angrily ; ' don 't make a scene . ' 
'Well then , come here ! '
'Well , come into the garden ! '
'One can 't live like this !
It is torture !
Why ? ' she asked , when they had at last reached a secluded seat at the corner of the lime @-@ tree avenue .
'There was , ' she said in a trembling voice . ' But , Kostya , do you really not see that I am not to blame ?
From the time I came down I wanted to adopt a tone ... but these people ...
Why did he come ?
How happy we were ! ' she said , choking with sobs that shook the whole of her expanded body .
She too was in great trouble that day .
'Oh , she is a horrid child ! ' she cried , addressing Levin . ' Where do these vile tendencies in her come from ? '
'But what has she done ? ' asked Levin rather indifferently . He wanted to consult her about his own affairs , and was annoyed at having come at an inopportune moment .
Dolly told Masha 's crime .
'That proves nothing ; it is not a bad tendency but just mischievousness , ' Levin comforted her .
'But you are upset about something ?
Why have you come ? ' asked Dolly , ' What 's happening there ? '
And by the tone of her question Levin knew that it would be easy for him to tell her what he meant to say .
'I was not there , but have been in the garden alone with Kitty .
We have quarrelled for the second time since ...
Dolly gazed at him with wise , comprehending eyes .
'Well , tell me , hand on heart - was there ... not on Kitty 's side , but on that gentleman 's ... a tone which might be unpleasant ... not unpleasant but terrible and offensive to a husband ? '
'Not I only , but Steve too .
'Well , all right , now I am tranquil .
I will turn him out , ' said Levin .
'But you will quarrel ? '
'Not at all !
It will be a pleasure for me , a real pleasure , ' said Levin with sparkling eyes . ' Come , forgive her , Dolly !
The little girl burst into sobs and buried her face in her mother 's lap , and Dolly placed her thin tender hand on the child 's head .
'What is there in common between us and him ? ' thought Levin , as he went in search of Veslovsky .
Passing through the hall he ordered the calèche to be harnessed to drive to the station .
'One of the springs broke yesterday , ' replied the footman .
Levin found Vasenka , who had unpacked his portmanteau and spread out his new songs , trying on a pair of leggings and preparing for a ride .
'Yes , it 's much cleaner , ' said Vasenka , placing his fat foot on a chair , fastening the bottom hook , and smiling good @-@ naturedly .
He was certainly a good @-@ natured fellow , and Levin felt sorry for him and ashamed of himself as a host when he noticed the shyness of Vasenka 's look .
On the table lay a piece of stick which when doing gymnastics that morning they had broken , trying to raise the warped parallel bars .
Levin took the broken stick and began pulling off the splintered bits at the end , not knowing how to begin .
'I wished ... ' He stopped , but suddenly remembering Kitty and all that had happened , he said , looking Veslovsky firmly in the eyes : ' I have ordered the horses to be harnessed for you . ' 
'What do you mean ? ' Vasenka began with surprise . ' To drive where ? '
'Why , are you going away , or has anything happened ? '
'It happens that I am expecting visitors , ' replied Levin more rapidly , breaking off the splintered bits of the stick with his strong fingers . ' Or no , I am not expecting visitors and nothing has happened , yet I request you to leave .
You may explain my impoliteness as you please . ' 
'I ask you for an explanation , ' he said with dignity , having at last understood .
'I can 't give you an explanation , ' said Levin softly and slowly , trying to control the trembling of his jaw , ' and it is better for you not to ask . ' 
As the splinters were now all broken off , Levin grasped the thick ends in his fingers and split the stick , carefully catching a piece as it fell .
Probably the sight of those strained arms , those muscles he had felt that morning when doing gymnastics , and the gleaming eyes , low voice and trembling jaws , convinced Vasenka more than the words .
He shrugged his shoulders , smiled contemptuously , and bowed .
'Can I not see Oblonsky ? '
The shrug and smile did not irritate Levin .
'What else is there for him to do ? ' he thought .
What fly has stung you ?
But the place where the fly had stung Levin was evidently still sore , for he again grew pale when Oblonsky wished to refer to his reason , and hastily interrupted him .
'Please don 't explain my reasons !
I feel ashamed before you and before him .
But I don 't think it will grieve him much to go away , and his presence is unpleasant to me and to my wife . ' 
'And I feel insulted and tortured !
And I have done nothing wrong and don 't deserve to suffer . ' 
'Well , I never expected this of you !
Levin turned away from him quickly and went far down one of the avenues , where he continued walking up and down alone .
'What does that mean ? ' wondered Levin when the footman ran out of the house and stopped the vehicle .
It was on account of the mechanic , whom Levin had quite forgotten .
He bowed and said something to Veslovsky , then climbed into the tarantas , and they drove away together .
Oblonsky and the Princess were indignant at Levin 's conduct .
'And who was inside the cart ? Who but Vasenka , with his Scotch bonnet and his songs and his leggings , sitting on the hay ! '
'At least you might have let him have the brougham ! ...
And then I hear : " Stop ! "
DOLLY CARRIED OUT HER INTENTION of going to see Anna .
Not to depend on the Levins for that journey , Dolly sent to the village to hire horses ; but Levin hearing of it came and reproached her .
'Why do you think your going would be unpleasant to me ?
Even if it were unpleasant it would be still more unpleasant for me if you did not use my horses , ' he said . ' You never told me definitely that you were going .
And that you should hire horses in the village is , in the first place , unpleasant to me , and besides that , they will undertake the job but won 't get you there .
Acting on Levin 's advice , Dolly started before daybreak .
The road was good , the calèche comfortable , the horses ran merrily , and on the box beside the coachman instead of a footman sat an office clerk whom Levin sent with her for safety .
Dolly dozed , and only woke up when approaching the inn where the horses were to be changed .
Her thoughts seemed strange to her .
At first she thought of the children , about whom , though the Princess and especially Kitty ( she had greater faith in Kitty ) had promised to look after them , she still felt anxious .
'If only Masha does not get into mischief again , or a horse does not kick Grisha , and if only Lily 's digestion does not get more upset . ' 
She began thinking that she would have to move into another house in Moscow for the winter , have the drawing @-@ room furniture re @-@ covered , and a new winter coat made for the eldest girl .
Then came problems of a more remote future : how she should start her children in the world .
'At present I am teaching Grisha , but that is only because I am free now and not having a baby .
Of course Steve is not to be counted on , but with the help of kind people I shall start them somehow ... But in case of another child ... '
And it occurred to her how inaccurate it is to say that woman 's curse is the bringing forth of children .
'Travail , that 's nothing - but pregnancy is torture , ' she thought , with her last pregnancy and the death of her infant in mind .
'I had one girl , but God released me . I buried her in Lent . ' 
'And are you very sorry ? ' asked Dolly .
You can 't work or anything .
This answer had seemed horrible to Dolly , despite the good @-@ natured sweetness of the young woman 's looks , but now she could not help recalling it .
In those cynical words there was some truth .
Even Kitty - young , pretty Kitty - how much plainer she has become ! And I when I am pregnant become hideous , I know .
Travail , suffering , monstrous suffering , and that final moment ... then nursing , sleepless nights , and that awful pain ! '
Dolly shuddered at the mere thought of the pain she had endured from sore nipples , from which she had suffered with almost every baby .
It is all so incomprehensible and difficult .
'And what is it all for ?
What will come of it all ?
Even now , if we had not spent this summer with Kostya and Kitty , I don 't know how we should have managed .
Of course Kostya and Kitty are so considerate that we don 't feel it ; but it can 't go on so .
Is Papa , who has kept scarcely anything for himself , to help us ? ...
So I can 't even give the children a start myself , unless it 's with other people 's help and with humiliation .
That is all I can hope for .
And for this , so much suffering and trouble ...
Again she remembered what the young woman had said . Again the recollection was repulsive to her , but she could not help admitting that there was a measure of crude truth in the words .
'Is it much further , Michael ? ' she asked the clerk , to dispel the thoughts that frightened her .
'They say it 's seven versts from this village . ' 
The women stopped on the bridge , inquisitively scrutinizing the calèche .
All the faces turned toward her seemed to Dolly to be healthy and bright , mocking her with their joy in life .
Everybody lives : these women , and my sister Nataly , and Varenka , and Anna to whom I am going , - only not I !
Am I better than she ?
I at least have a husband whom I love .
Not as I wished to love , but still I do love him ; but Anna did not love hers .
She wishes to live .
God has implanted that need in our souls .
It is quite possible I might have done the same .
I don 't even now know whether I did well to listen to her at that terrible time when she came to me in Moscow .
I ought then to have left my husband and begun life anew .
I might have loved and been loved , the real way .
And is it better now ?
Is that any better ?
I was still attractive then , still had my good looks , ' she went on , feeling that she wanted to see herself in a glass .
And the most passionate and impossible romances occurred to Dolly 's fancy .
'Anna has acted excellently , and I at any rate shall not reproach her at all .
Like Anna , she confessed everything to her husband , and Oblonsky 's surprise and embarrassment at the announcement made her smile .
Wrapped in such dreams she reached the turning from the high road , which led to Vozdvizhensk .
THE COACHMAN STOPPED THE HORSES and looked round toward a field of rye on the right , where some peasants sat beside a cart .
The clerk wished to get down , but then , changing his mind , shouted authoritatively and beckoned to a peasant .
The metallic sound of a scythe being hammered beside the cart ceased , and one of the peasants rose and came toward the calèche .
The curly @-@ headed old man , with a piece of bast tied round his head , his rounded back dark with perspiration , increased his speed , approached the calèche and put his sunburnt arm on the mud @-@ guard .
'Are they at home , my good man ? ' said Dolly vaguely , not knowing how to speak of Anna even to a peasant .
What do you want ? ' He turned toward a lad beside the cart who was shouting something .
And who may you be ? '
'I tell you it 's just there , where you come out , ' and he went on rubbing his hand along the mud @-@ guard of the calèche .
'There , you see , when you 've turned to the left you 'll knock straight up against it , ' said the peasant , evidently unwilling to let them go , and wishing to talk .
It was Vronsky with his jockey , Veslovsky and Anna on horseback , and Princess Barbara with Sviyazhsky in the char @-@ a @-@ banc .
Anna rode in front beside Veslovsky .
She rode quietly , on a small sturdy English cob with a close @-@ cropped mane and short tail .
Dolly was struck by the beauty of her head with locks of black hair which had escaped from under her top hat , her full shoulders and fine waist in the black riding @-@ habit , and her whole quiet graceful bearing .
For a moment she thought it improper for Anna to be riding on horseback .
Despite her elegance , everything about Anna - her bearing , clothes and movements - was so simple , quiet , and dignified that nothing could seem more natural .
Behind them rode Vronsky .
He was on a thoroughbred dark bay , which was obviously heated by galloping , and he was using the reins to hold it in .
Behind him rode a short man dressed as a jockey .
Anna 's face immediately brightened into a joyful smile when she recognized Dolly in the little figure pressed back in a corner of the old calèche .
Riding up to the calèche she jumped unaided from the horse and , holding up her habit , ran toward Dolly .
'It 's what I thought , but dared not expect !
What a pleasure !
You cannot imagine how delighted I am ! ' she cried , now pressing her face to Dolly 's and kissing her , now leaning back to gaze smilingly at her .
'What joy , Alexis ! ' she said , turning to Vronsky , who had dismounted and was walking toward them .
Vronsky , taking off his grey top hat , approached Dolly .
'You can have no idea how pleased we are that you have come ; ' he said , putting peculiar emphasis into his words , while a smile exposed his strong white teeth .
Vasenka Veslovsky , without dismounting , raised his cap and welcomed the visitor , joyously waving his ribbons above his head .
'Oh ! ' said Dolly , and her face involuntarily expressed displeasure .
She knew that the Princess Barbara had all her life been a hanger @-@ on to various rich relatives , but that she - a relation of Dolly 's husband - should now be living in the house of Vronsky , a perfect stranger to her , offended Dolly .
Anna noticed Dolly 's expression , became confused , blushed , let her habit slip out of her hands , and stumbled over it .
Dolly walked up to the char @-@ a @-@ banc and coldly greeted Princess Barbara .
She was acquainted with Sviyazhsky too .
He asked how his friend the crank was getting on with his young wife , and having glanced at the ill @-@ matched horses and the patched mud @-@ guard of the calèche , offered the ladies seats in the char @-@ a @-@ bane .
'I will go in that vehicle , ' he said . ' My horse is a quiet one , and the Princess drives splendidly . ' 
'No , stay as you are , ' said Anna , who had also come up , ' and we two will go in the calèche , ' and giving Dolly her arm she led her away .
Dolly was dazzled by the elegant equipage of a kind she had never seen , by the beautiful horses and the elegant , brilliant persons about her .
But what struck her most was the change that had taken place in Anna , whom she knew and loved .
Another woman less observant , who had not known Anna before , especially one who had not thought the thoughts that were in Dolly 's mind on the way , would not have noticed anything peculiar in Anna .
But now Dolly was struck by that temporary beauty which only comes to women in moments of love , and which she now found in Anna 's face .
When the two women took their seats in the calèche , both were seized with shyness .
Philip the coachman and the clerk shared that feeling .
The clerk , to hide his embarrassment , bustled about , helping the ladies in , but Philip became morose and made up his mind not to be imposed upon by this eternal superiority .
He smiled ironically as he glanced at the raven trotter of the char @-@ a @-@ banc , deciding that that horse was good for nothing but a promenade , and could not do its forty versts on a hot day at one go .
The peasants beside the cart all got up and looked with merry curiosity at the visitor , making their own comments .
'There now , Uncle Gerasim ! That raven gelding would cart the sheaves in no time . ' 
Is that a woman in breeches ? ' cried one , pointing to Vasenka Veslovsky , who was getting into the side @-@ saddle .
'No , it 's a man .
See how easily he jumped up ! '
'I say , lads ! It seems we are not to have a sleep ! '
'What chance of a sleep to @-@ day ? ' said the old man blinking at the sun . ' It 's too late !
'You are looking at me , ' she said , ' and wondering whether I can be happy , placed as I am ?
I am ashamed to confess it , but I ... I am unforgivably happy !
Something magical has happened to me : like a dream when one feels frightened and creepy , and suddenly wakes up to the knowledge that no such terrors exist .
I have lived through sufferings and terrors , but for a long time past - especially since we came here - I have been happy ! ... ' she said , looking at Dolly timidly and with a questioning smile .
'I am so glad ! ' answered Dolly , smiling , but in a colder tone than she intended . ' I am very glad for your sake .
Why did you not write to me ? '
'Why ? ...
Because I did not dare ... you forget my position . ' 
If only you knew how I ...
I consider ... '
Dolly wanted to tell Anna what she had been thinking that morning , but for some reason it now seemed out of place .
What are all those buildings ? Quite a town ! ' she asked , to change the subject , pointing to the red and green roofs visible above a living green wall of acacias and lilacs .
'It goes all right , Anna Arkadyevna ! ' he shouted .
Anna did not even glance at him ; but it still seemed to Dolly out of place to begin to discuss this big subject in the calèche , so she briefly replied :
'I don 't take any view . I always loved you , and if one loves , one loves the whole person as he or she is , and not as one might wish them to be . ' 
Anna , turning her eyes away from her friend and screwing them up ( this was a new habit of hers and unfamiliar to Dolly ) , grew thoughtful , trying thoroughly to grasp the meaning of the remark .
'If you had any sins , ' she said , ' they would all be forgiven you for coming here and for those words ! '
And Dolly noticed that tears had started to her eyes .
'But what are those buildings ?
'They are the employees ' houses , the stud farm , and the stables , ' answered Anna . ' And here the park begins .
Everything had been neglected , but Alexis has had it all renovated .
He is very fond of this estate , and - a thing I never expected of him - he is quite enthusiastic in managing the place .
But of course his is such a talented nature !
Whatever he takes up , he does splendidly !
He is not only not bored , but passionately engrossed in his occupations .
He has grown into a first @-@ rate , prudent landlord , as I recognize ; in farming matters he is even stingy , but only in farming .
It is the new hospital .
I think it will cost more than a hundred thousand roubles .
That is his hobby just now .
And do you know why he started it ?
The peasants asked him to let them some meadows at a reduced rent , I think , and he refused , and I reproached him with being stingy .
Of course it was not that alone , but one thing with another caused him to start that hospital , to show , you know , that he is not stingy .
C 'est une petitesse [ It is a pettiness . ] if you like , but I love him the better for it !
'How fine ! ' said Dolly , looking with involuntary surprise at a handsome house with a row of columns standing out among the variously tinted foliage of the old trees in the garden .
And from upstairs the view is wonderful . ' 
They drove into a gravelled courtyard surrounded by flowers , where two men were making a border of rough porous stones round a well @-@ forked flower @-@ bed and stopped beneath a roofed portico .
'Ah , they 've already arrived , ' said Anna , looking at the horses that were being led away from the front door . ' Don 't you think that one is a beautiful horse ?
Bring it here , and get me some sugar .
Where is the Count ? ' she asked the two elegant footmen who had rushed out . ' Ah , there he is ! ' she went on , seeing Vronsky and Veslovsky coming out to meet her .
'Oh no ! That 's too far off !
Well , let 's go in , ' said Anna , who had given her favourite horse the sugar the footman had brought .
Anna turned to Dolly . ' How long can you stay ?
Only a day !
'No , Dolly darling ! ...
Come ! Come along ! ' and Anna led the way to Dolly 's room .
It was not the grand room that Vronsky had suggested , but one for which Anna apologized to Dolly .
And this room needing an apology was full of luxuries , such as Dolly had never lived among , which reminded her of the best hotels abroad .
'Well , dearest ! How happy I am ! ' said Anna , who in her riding @-@ habit had sat down for a moment beside Dolly .
Grown a big girl , I suppose ? '
'Yes , quite big , ' answered Dolly shortly , and was herself surprised that she could talk so coldly about her children . ' We are very comfortable at the Levins ' , ' she added .
'There now ! Had I only known that you don 't despise me ... ' said Anna , ' you should all have come to us .
You know Steve and Alexis are old and great friends , ' she added and suddenly blushed .
'Yes , but we are so comfortable ... ' answered Dolly with embarrassment .
'However , my joy makes me talk nonsense !
But really , dear , I am so glad to see you , ' said Anna , kissing her again . ' You have not yet told me how and what you think about me , and I want to know everything .
But I am glad that you will see me just as I am .
Above all , I don 't want you to think that I wish to prove anything .
I don 't want to prove anything : simply I wish to live , not hurting anyone but myself .
However , that needs a long talk , and we will talk it all well over later .
Everything was new , from the new French wall @-@ papers to the carpet which covered the whole floor .
The bed had a spring and an overlay mattress , with a specially shaped bolster and small pillows with silk slips .
The marble washstand , the dressing @-@ table , the couch , the tables , the bronze clock on the mantelpiece , the curtains and door @-@ hangings were all costly and new .
The smart lady 's maid with hair stylishly done , and wearing a dress more fashionable than Dolly 's , who came to offer her services , was as new and expensive as everything else in the room .
She was ashamed of the very patches and darns on which she at home prided herself .
At home it was clear that six jackets required twenty @-@ four arshins of nainsook at sixty @-@ five kopeks , which comes to more than fifteen roubles , besides the trimmings and the work ; and she had saved all that .
But before the maid she felt not exactly ashamed but uncomfortable .
The smart maid had to go to her mistress , and Annushka remained with Dolly .
Annushka was evidently very pleased that the lady had come , and chattered incessantly .
'I grew up with Anna Arkadyevna ; she is dearer to me than anything .
Is it for us to judge ?
And how he seems to love ... '
'Well then , have this washed if possible , ' interrupted Dolly .
'Yes , ma 'am !
What a husband ... '
Dolly was glad when Anna came in and thereby put an end to Annushka 's chatter .
Anna had changed into a very simple lawn dress .
Dolly looked carefully at this simple dress .
Anna was now no longer embarrassed .
She was free and at her ease .
Greatly improved .
Would you like to see her ?
Come , I 'll show her to you ...
I 've had such trouble with the nurses , ' she began .
'We had an Italian wet nurse for her .
Good , but so stupid !
We wanted to send her back , but the child is so used to her that we are still keeping her . ' 
You wished to ask about her name ?
It troubles Alexis .
She has no name .
That is , her name is Karenina , ' said Anna , screwing up her eyes till only the meeting lashes could be seen . ' However , we will talk about all that later , ' said she , suddenly brightening .
'Come ! I will show her to you .
In the nursery the luxury noticeable in the rest of the house struck Dolly still mare strongly .
Here were perambulators ordered from England , an apparatus to teach a baby to walk , a specially constructed piece of furniture like a billiard @-@ table for the baby to crawl on , swings , and baths of a new special kind .
All these were English , strongly made , of good quality , and evidently very expensive .
The room was large , very lofty and light .
When they entered the little girl was sitting in her chemise in a little arm @-@ chair at a table , having her dinner of broth which she was spilling all over her little chest .
A Russian nursemaid was feeding the child and evidently herself eating also .
Neither the wet nurse nor the head nurse were to be seen : they were in the next room , where one could hear them talking in a peculiar French , the only tongue in which they could converse .
To each word of Anna 's the Englishwoman quickly repeated , ' Yes , my lady ! ' several times .
The way the little girl crawled also greatly pleased Dolly .
Not one of her children had crawled like that .
The baby looked wonderfully sweet when she was put down on the carpet , with her little frock tucked up behind .
But Dolly did not at all like the general atmosphere of that nursery , especially the English nurse .
Anna wished to get the baby her toy and could not find it .
But the most astonishing thing was that when asked how many teeth the baby had , Anna made a mistake and knew nothing of the two latest teeth .
'I feel it hard sometimes that I am as it were superfluous here , ' said Anna on leaving the nursery , lifting her train to avoid the toys that lay beside the door . ' It was quite different with the first one . ' 
You know I have seen him , Serezha , ' said Anna , screwing up her eyes as if peering at something far off . ' However , we will talk about that afterwards .
Would you believe it , I am just like a starving woman to whom a full meal has been served , and who does not know what to begin on first ?
The full meal is you and the talks I am going to have with you , and which I could not have with anyone else , and I don 't know on what to begin first !
I must speak out about everything . Yes , I must give you a sketch of the people you will meet here , ' she began .
You know her , and I know your and Steve 's opinion of her .
Steve says the one aim of her life is to prove her superiority to Aunt Catherine Pavlovna . That is quite true ; but she is kind , and I am very grateful to her .
There was a moment in Petersburg when I needed a chaperon .
Just then she turned up .
I see you do not realize all the difficulty of my position ... there in Petersburg , ' she added . ' Here I am quite tranquil and happy ; but about that later on .
Then there 's Sviyazhsky : he is a Marshal of Nobility and a very decent fellow , but he wants something from Alexis .
You see , with his means , now that we have settled in the country , Alexis can have great influence .
Then there is Tushkevich : you have met him , he was always with Betsy .
Now he has been deposed and has come to us .
As Alexis says he is one of those men who are very agreeable if one takes them for what they wish to appear , et puis , il est comme il faut , [ And then , he is good form . ] as the Princess Barbara says .
Then there 's Veslovsky ... you know him .
He is a nice boy , ' she said , and a roguish smile puckered her lips . ' What outrageous affair was that with Levin ?
Veslovsky told Alexis , and we simply can 't believe it .
Il est très gentil et naïf , ' [ He is very nice and naive . ] she added with the same smile . ' Men need distraction , and Alexis needs an audience ; so I value all this company .
Things must be lively and amusing here , so that Alexis shall not wish for anything new !
Alexis thinks highly of him .
Then there 's the doctor , a young man , not exactly a Nihilist , but - you know , eats with his knife ... but a very good doctor .
'Her husband will give her a divorce , and then I shall go back to my solitude ; but at present I can be of use and I fulfil my duty , however hard it may be , not like others ...
And how kind you are , and how well you have done to come !
They live like the best of married couples . It is for God to judge them , not for us .
Think of Biryuzovsky and Avenyeva ...
And even Nikandrov ! And how about Vasilev with Mamanova , and Lisa Neptunova ... ?
No one said anything against them ?
And in the end they were all received again ...
Dinner is at seven . Steve did very well to send you .
He must keep in with them .
You know , through his mother and brother he can do anything .
And then they do much good .
Their conversation was interrupted by Anna , who had found the men in the billiard @-@ room and brought them back with her to the verandah .
As there was still plenty of time before dinner , and the weather was beautiful , several different ways of passing the next two hours were proposed .
There were a great many ways of spending time at Vozdvizhensk , all differing from those at Pokrovsk .
'Une partie de [ A game of . ] lawn tennis , ' suggested Veslovsky with his pleasing smile . ' We will be partners again , Anna Arkadyevna ! '
'No , it 's too hot : better let 's walk through the garden and go for a row , to let Darya Alexandrovna see the banks , ' suggested Vronsky .
'I will agree to anything , ' said Sviyazhsky .
'I think Dolly will find a walk the pleasantest , won 't you ?
And then we can go in the boat , ' said Anna .
All agreed to this .
Two couples - Anna with Sviyazhsky and Dolly with Vronsky walked down a garden path .
Dolly was somewhat embarrassed and troubled by the quite novel circle she found herself in .
In the abstract , theoretically , she not only excused but even approved of Anna 's action .
As is frequently the case with irreproachably moral women who become tired of the monotony of a moral life , she from a distance not only excused a guilty love but even envied it .
Besides , she loved Anna from her heart .
But actually seeing her among these people so alien to herself , with their fashionable tone which was quite new to her , Dolly felt ill at ease .
In particular it was disagreeable to her to see the Princess Barbara , who forgave them everything for the sake of the comforts she enjoyed there .
In general , in the abstract Dolly approved the step Anna had taken , but it was unpleasant to her to see the man for whose sake the step had been taken .
Besides , she had never liked Vronsky .
She considered him very proud , and saw nothing in him to justify that pride ; except his wealth .
But involuntarily he , here in his own house , imposed on her more than ever , and she could not feel at ease with him .
She experienced the same kind of shyness in his presence that she had felt when the lady 's maid saw her jacket .
As with the maid she felt not exactly ashamed but uncomfortable about the patches , so with him she felt not exactly ashamed but ill @-@ at @-@ ease about herself .
'Yes , it is a very handsome building and in a good old style , ' he said .
'I like the courtyard in front of the portico very much .
'Oh no ! ' he replied , and his face lit up with pleasure . ' If you had only seen that courtyard in spring ! '
And he began , at first with reserve but more and more carried away by his subject , to draw her attention to various details of the adornment of the house and garden .
One could see that , having devoted great pains to the improvement and decoration of his place , Vronsky felt compelled to boast of them to a fresh person , and was heartily pleased by Dolly 's praises .
'If you care to see the hospital and are not too tired - it is not far .
Shall we go ? ' he suggested , glancing at her face to assure himself that she really was not bored .
'Will you come , Anna ? ' he said , turning to her .
Yes , it is a monument he is erecting here , ' said Anna to Dolly , with the same sly knowing smile with which she had previously spoken about the hospital .
'Oh , it 's a great undertaking ! ' said Sviyazhsky .
'C 'est devenu tellement commun , les écoles , ' [ Schools have become so common . ] answered Vronsky . ' Of course that 's not the reason , but I ...
The ladies opened their sunshades and entered the sidewalk .
After several turnings they passed through a gate , and Dolly saw on the high ground before her a large , red , nearly completed building of a fanciful shape .
The still unpainted iron roof shone dazzlingly in the sunshine .
Beside the finished building another as yet surrounded by scaffolding was being built . Workmen wearing aprons stood on the scaffolding laying bricks , pouring water from wooden pails , or smoothing the mortar .
'How quickly your work gets on ! ' said Sviyazhsky . ' When I was last here there was no roof . ' 
'And what is this new building ? '
'That will be the doctor 's quarters and the dispensary , ' replied Vronsky ; and seeing the architect in his short jacket coming toward them , he apologized to the ladies and went to meet him .
Avoiding the pit from which the men were taking mortar , he stopped and began heatedly discussing something with the architect .
'The pediment is still too low , ' he answered Anna 's question as to what it was all about .
'I said the foundations ought to be raised , ' said Anna .
'Yes , of course that would have been better , Anna Arkadyevna , ' replied the architect , ' but it 's done now . ' 
Having finished talking with the architect Vronsky rejoined the ladies and led them to the hospital .
Although they were still working at the cornices outside and painting inside on the ground floor , the upper story was nearly finished .
Ascending the broad cast @-@ iron staircase to the landing , they entered the first large room .
'This is the waiting @-@ room , ' said Vronsky . ' There will be a desk , a table and a cupboard here : nothing more . ' 
'This way ! We will pass here .
Don 't go near the window ! ' said Anna , feeling whether the paint was dry . ' Alexis , the paint is dry already , ' she added .
Then he showed the marble baths and the beds with peculiar spring mattresses .
Sviyazhsky appreciated everything like one who is acquainted with all the newest improvements .
Dolly was simply surprised at what she had never before seen , and wishing to understand it all , asked for information about every detail , which evidently gratified Vronsky .
'Yes , I think this will be the only quite correctly planned hospital in Russia , ' said Sviyazhsky .
'And will you have a maternity ward ? ' inquired Dolly . ' That is so much wanted in the country .
I often ... '
Despite his courtesy , Vronsky interrupted her .
Everything interested Dolly and everything pleased her , especially Vronsky himself with his natural and naive enthusiasm .
'Yes , he is a very nice , good fellow , ' she thought again and again , not listening to him but looking at him , understanding his expression , and mentally putting herself in Anna 's place .
In this animated state she liked him so much that she understood Anna 's being able to fall in love with him .
'I don 't understand anything about horses , and shall be very pleased to , ' answered Dolly , taken rather by surprise .
She saw by Vronsky 's face that he wanted something of her .
She was not mistaken .
As soon as they had passed through the gate back into the garden , he glanced in the direction Anna had taken , and having assured himself that she could not hear or see them , he began .
Dolly did not reply and only looked at him with alarm .
Alone with him she suddenly felt frightened : his laughing eyes and stern expression scared her .
Or maybe it 's about Vasenka Veslovsky and his relations with Anna ?
Or possibly about Kitty , and that he feels guilty toward her ? '
Everything she surmised was unpleasant , but she did not hit on what he actually wished to speak about .
Have I understood you rightly ? ' he asked , turning toward her .
'Oh , yes ! ' answered Dolly , closing her sunshade , ' but ... '
I am the cause of that position and therefore I feel it . ' 
'In Society it is hell ! ' he said quickly with a dark frown . ' It is impossible to imagine greater moral torments than those she endured for two weeks in Petersburg ... I beg you to believe me ! '
'Yes , but here , so long as neither Anna nor you ... feel that you need Society ... '
'Society ! ' he exclaimed with contempt . ' What need can I have of Society ? '
'Till then , and that may be always , you are happy and tranquil .
I see that Anna is happy , quite happy , she has already told me so , ' said Dolly smiling ; and involuntarily while saying it she doubted whether Anna was really happy .
But Vronsky , it seemed , did not doubt it .
I am afraid of what is before us ... I beg your pardon !
He stood before her .
'I see she is happy , ' he repeated , and the doubt as to whether Anna was really happy struck Dolly yet more strongly . ' But can it continue ?
Whether we acted rightly or wrongly is another question ; the die is cast , ' he said , changing from Russian into French , ' and we are bound together for life .
We have a child , we may have other children .
Yet the law and the circumstances of our position are such that thousands of complications appear which at present , while resting after all her sufferings and trials , she neither sees nor wishes to see .
That is natural .
I hate this falsehood ! ' he said with an energetic gesture of denial , and looked at Dolly with a gloomily questioning expression .
Imagine the hardship and horror of this situation !
I have tried to speak to Anna about it , but it irritates her .
She does not understand and I cannot speak out about it to her .
Now look at the other side of it .
I am happy , happy in her love , but I need an occupation .
I have found one . I am proud of it , and consider it more honourable than the occupations of my former comrades at Court or in the Service .
I certainly would not exchange my work for theirs .
I am working here , remaining on the spot , and I am happy and contented , and we need nothing more for our happiness .
I like my activities .
Imagine the situation of a man who knows in advance that children born of him and of the woman he loves will not be his , but some one else 's - some one who will hate them and will have nothing to do with them !
He paused , evidently greatly excited .
'Yes , of course , I quite understand .
But what can Anna do ? ' asked Dolly .
'Well , this brings me to the point of my talk , ' he went on , calming himself with an effort . ' Anna can do it ; . it depends on her ...
Even to be able to petition the Emperor for permission to adopt the child , a divorce will be necessary , and that depends on Anna .
It is only necessary to write to him .
He knows what torture every recollection of him causes her , and knowing her he still demands a letter from her .
I understand that it is painful for her , but the reasons are so important that one must passer pardessus toutes ces finesses de sentiment .
Help me to persuade her to write to him and demand a divorce ! '
'Yes , certainly , ' said Dolly thoughtfully , vividly remembering her last conversation with Karenin . ' Yes certainly , ' she repeated resolutely , remembering Anna .
'Use your influence with her , get her to write , I don 't wish and am almost unable to speak to her about it . ' 
'Very well , I will speak to her .
But how is it she herself does not think of it ? ' asked Dolly , suddenly remembering that strange new habit Anna had of screwing up her eyes .
And she remembered that it was just when the intimate side of life was in question that Anna screwed up her eyes .
'As if she were blinking at her life so as not to see it all , ' thought Dolly . ' Certainly I will speak to her , for my own sake and for hers , ' she said in reply to his expression of gratitude .
FINDING DOLLY ALREADY RETURNED , Anna looked attentively into her eyes as if asking about the talk she had had with Vronsky , but she did not ask in words .
'I think it 's nearly dinner @-@ time , ' she said . ' We have not yet seen anything of one another ...
I am counting on this evening .
Now I must go and dress , and you too , I suppose .
Dolly went to her room , feeling amused .
'This is all I was able to do , ' she smilingly said to Anna , who came to her in a third dress , again extremely simple .
'Yes , we are very formal here , ' Anna remarked , as if excusing her own smartness . ' Alexis is seldom so pleased about anything as he is at your having come .
He is decidedly in love with you , ' she added . ' But aren 't you tired ? '
There was no time to discuss anything before dinner .
When they entered the drawing room the Princess Barbara and the men were already there .
Vronsky introduced the doctor and the steward to his visitor ; the architect had already been presented at the hospital .
The fat butler - his round , clean @-@ shaven face and starched white tie shining - announced dinner .
The ladies rose ; Vronsky asked Sviyazhsky to take in Anna , and himself went up to Dolly .
It was evident that it depended no more on Anna than on Veslovsky .
Anna , Sviyazhsky , the Princess , and Veslovsky were all equally guests , gaily making use of what was provided for them .
Anna was the hostess only in what concerned the conversation .
Reference was made to Tushkevich and Veslovsky having been for a row by themselves , and Tushkevich began to tell about the last boat races at the Petersburg Yacht Club .
But at the first pause Anna turned to the architect , to draw him into the conversation .
'American methods ! ' said Sviyazhsky with a smile .
'Yes . There they erect buildings rationally ... '
The conversation passed on to the abuses in the government of the United States , but Anna quickly turned it to another theme so as to draw the steward out of his silence .
'Have you ever seen a reaping machine ? ' she asked Dolly . ' We had been to look at them when we met you .
'How do they act ? ' asked Dolly .
'Just like scissors .
Like this ... '
Anna took a knife and a fork in her beautiful white hands , sparkling with rings , and began to demonstrate .
'Rather like penknives ! ' said Veslovsky playfully , never taking his eyes from her .
Anna smiled slightly , but did not answer him .
'Is it not true , Karl Fedorich , that it is like scissors ? she asked , turning to the steward .
I saw one at the Vienna Exhibition that bound the sheaves with wire , ' remarked Sviyazhsky . ' That kind would be more profitable , '
'I had been there , but had evaporated , ' said the doctor , with dismal jocularity .
'Then you have had some good exercise ? '
'Magnificent ! '
'What a pity ! ' said Anna , and having thus paid the tribute of politeness to the retainers , she turned to her friends .
'All the same , it would be difficult to construct a reaper from your description , Anna Arkadyevna , ' Sviyazhsky chaffed her .
'Oh , why not ? ' said Anna , with a smile which said that she knew there had been something engaging in her way of describing the reaper and that Sviyazhsky had noticed it .
'But then , Anna Arkadyevna 's knowledge of architecture is wonderful , ' remarked Tushkevich .
'Oh , yes ! Yesterday I heard Anna Arkadyevna mention damp courses and plinths , ' said Veslovsky . ' Am I saying it right ? '
'There 's nothing to be surprised at , considering how much I hear and see of it , ' said Anna . ' And you , I 'm sure , don 't even know what houses are made of ! '
Dolly noticed that Anna did not like the playful tone that had arisen between herself and Veslovsky , yet could not help falling in with it .
Vronsky behaved in this matter quite unlike Levin .
He evidently did not attach any importance to Veslovsky 's chatter , and even encouraged it .
'Come , Veslovsky ! Tell us what keeps the bricks together ! '
'Cement , of course ! '
'Bravo !
'Well ... it 's something like paste ... no , putty ! ' replied Veslovsky , rousing general laughter .
The conversation among the diners - except the doctor , the architect and the steward , who sat in gloomy silence - was incessant , now gliding smoothly , now catching on something and touching one or other of them to the quick .
Once Dolly was stung to the quick ; and so aroused that she even flushed up , and afterwards wondered whether she had said anything superfluous and disagreeable .
Sviyazhsky began talking about Levin and mentioned his peculiar view that machines only did harm in Russian agriculture .
And what opinions are possible on so plain a matter ? '
'Turkish opinions , ' said Veslovsky , turning to Anna with a smile .
'That is our Russian indifference , ' said Vronsky , pouring water from an iced decanter into a very thin glass with a stem , ' not to realize the duties our rights impose on us , and therefore to deny those duties . ' 
'I know no one who fulfils his duties more strictly , ' said Dolly , irritated by Vronsky 's superior tone .
I consider that the duty of going to the meetings , and considering a peasant 's case about a horse , is as important as anything else I can do .
I shall consider it an honour if they elect me to the Zemstvo .
It is only so that I can make a return for the advantages I enjoy as a landowner .
Unfortunately people do not understand the importance the large landowners should have in the State . ' 
To Dolly it sounded strange to hear how assured he was of being in the right , here at his own table .
She remembered how Levin , who held the opposite opinion , was equally positive in his opinions at his own table .
But she was fond of Levin , and therefore sided with him .
'Then we may expect to see you at the next Session , Count ? ' asked Sviyazhsky . ' But you must come in good time , so as to be there on the eighth .
If you would only do me the honour of stopping with me ... '
Formerly we used to have so many officials that there had to be an official for everything that was done , and now we have public workers for everything !
And I fear that with the multiplication of these positions they become a mere form .
Of how many institutions are you a member , Nicholas Ivanich ? ' she asked , addressing Sviyazhsky ; ' more than twenty , isn 't it ? '
Although Anna spoke playfully , irritation was perceptible in her tone .
Dolly , who was attentively watching her and Vronsky , noticed it at once .
She also saw that at this conversation Vronsky 's face immediately assumed a serious and obstinate expression .
Then they played lawn @-@ tennis .
The players , having chosen their partners , took their places on the carefully levelled and rolled croquet lawn , on the two sides of a net stretched between two small gilded pillars .
Dolly tried to play , but was long unable to understand the game , and by the time she did understand it she was so tired that she sat down beside the Princess Barbara to watch the others .
Her partner Tushkevich also gave it up , but the rest played for a long time .
Sviyazhsky and Vronsky both played very well and seriously .
Veslovsky played worse than the others .
He , as well as the other men , had with the ladies ' permission taken off his coat , and his large handsome figure in white shirt @-@ sleeves , his ruddy perspiring face and impetuous movements , stamped themselves on the memories of the onlookers .
As soon as Dolly that night had gone to bed and closed her eyes , she saw Vasenka Veslovsky rushing hither and thither on the croquet lawn .
While they were playing Dolly was not feeling happy .
She did not like the bantering tone between Anna and Veslovsky that continued during the game , nor the unnaturalness of grown @-@ up people when they play childish games in the absence of children .
But not to disturb the others and to while away the time , after resting she rejoined the players and pretended to like it .
All that day she felt as if she were acting in a theatre with better actors than herself , and that her bad performance was spoiling the whole affair .
But that evening during the game she resolved to leave next day .
Those painful maternal worries , which she had so hated on her journey , now after a day spent without them appeared in quite a different light and drew her back to them .
When , after evening tea and a row in the boat at night @-@ time , Dolly entered her bedroom alone , took off her dress and sat down to do up her thin hair for the night , she felt great relief .
Even the thought that Anna would come in a moment was disagreeable to her .
She wished to be alone with her thoughts .
DOLLY WAS READY TO GET INTO bed when Anna in her nightgown came into the room .
Several times during the day Anna had begun to talk about intimate matters , but after a few words she had always paused , saying : ' Later on when we are alone we will talk it all over .
I have so much to say to you ! '
Now they were alone , but Anna did not know what to speak about .
She sat by the window , looking at Dolly and mentally reviewing all those stores of intimate topics that had seemed inexhaustible , and could find nothing to say .
It seemed to her at that moment as if everything had already been said .
'Angry ?
No ! ' replied Dolly with a smile .
But you know one does not forgive those things ! '
'No , no , ' said Anna , turning away and looking out of the open window . ' But it was not my fault , and whose fault was it ?
Could things have been different ?
Could it have happened to you not to be Steve 's wife ? '
But I want you to tell me this ... '
I am very glad !
It is not enough to say he 's a fine fellow , ' she repeated .
Dolly smiled .
'But tell me about yourself .
'With Alexis ? ' said Anna . ' I know you have .
But I want to ask you frankly , what do you think of me and of my life ? '
'Oh , but all the same , tell me ! ...
You see what my life is .
But don 't forget that you see us in summer when you have come and we are not alone ...
But we came here in early spring and lived quite alone , and we shall live alone again . I don 't wish for anything better .
One day there are races and his horses are running ; he goes .
But think of me , imagine my position ... But why talk of it ! '
She smiled . ' Well then , what did he talk about to you ? '
But all the same if it is possible you should get married . ' 
'That is , get a divorce ? ' said Anna . ' Do you know , the only woman who called on me in Petersburg was Betsy Tverskaya ?
[ At bottom , she 's the most depraved woman in existence . ]
Don 't think I am making any comparison ...
But I could not help remembering ...
Perhaps you will say it is egotism , but what legitimate and noble egotism !
He wants , first of all , to legitimatize his daughter and to be your husband and have a right to you . ' 
'What wife , what slave could be such a slave as I am in my position ? ' Anna sullenly interrupted her .
'But the chief thing he wants is that you should not suffer . ' 
'And his most legitimate wish is that your children should not be nameless . ' 
'What children ? ' said Anna , screwing up her eyes and not looking at Dolly .
'He may be at ease about that : I shall not have any more children . ' 
'How do you know you won 't ? '
'I shan 't , because I don 't want them . ' 
And in spite of her agitation Anna smiled on noticing the naive expression of curiosity , surprise and terror on Dolly 's face .
'Impossible ! said Dolly , with wide @-@ open eyes .
It was the very thing she had dreamt of , but now on learning that it was possible , she was horrified .
She felt that it was too simple a solution of too complex a question .
'Why ?
Remember I have to choose between two things : either to become pregnant , that is ill , or to be the friend and comrade of my husband - for he is my husband all the same , ' said Anna , in a tone of intentional levity .
'Well , yes , of course , ' said Dolly , listening to the very arguments which she had put to herself but not finding them so convincing as before .
'For you and for others , ' said Anna , as if guessing her thoughts , ' there may still be some doubt , but for me ...
Remember , I am not a wife , he loves me as long as his love lasts !
Well , how am I to keep his love ?
With unusual rapidity , as happens at times of great agitation , thoughts and recollections crowded into Dolly 's mind .
He threw her over and took another .
Is it possible that Anna will attract and keep Count Vronsky in this way ?
If he looks for that sort of thing he will find women whose dresses and manners are still brighter and more attractive .
Dolly made no answer and only sighed .
Anna noticed the sigh , which expressed dissent , and continued .
She had other arguments in store , and such powerful ones that they could not be answered .
'You say it is not right ?
But you must consider , ' she went on . ' You forget my position .
How can I desire children ?
I am not talking of the suffering : I am not afraid of that .
But think who my children would be !
Unfortunate beings , who would have to bear a stranger 's name !
By the very fact of their birth they would have to be ashamed of their mother , their father , their birth ! '
'But that 's just why a divorce is necessary ! '
She wanted to reproduce the arguments with which she had so often convinced herself .
'What was my reason given me for , if I am not to use it to avoid bringing unfortunate beings into the world ? '
'I should always feel guilty toward those unhappy children , ' said she . ' If they don 't exist at any rate they are not unhappy , but if they are unhappy I alone shall be to blame . ' 
These were the very arguments Dolly had put to herself , but now she listened without understanding them .
'How can one be guilty toward beings who don 't exist ? ' thought she .
And suddenly the question came into her mind , whether it could be better in any case for her favourite Grisha if he had never existed ?
This appeared to her so monstrous and strange that she shook her head , to dispel the confusion of insane thoughts that whirled in her brain .
'Well , I don 't know ; but it is not right , ' she said with a look of disgust .
'Yes , but don 't forget what you are and what I am ...
The question for you is , whether you desire not to have any more children ; for me it is , whether I desire to have them .
And that is a great difference .
Don 't you see that , situated as I am , I cannot desire them ? '
She suddenly felt that she was so far away from Anna that there were questions on which they could never meet , and about which it was best not to talk .
'THEN THERE IS ALL THE MORE NEED to regularize your position if possible , ' said Dolly .
'Yes , if possible , ' Anna said , in what had suddenly become quite a different - a quiet and sad - voice .
I was told your husband had agreed ... '
'Dolly , I don 't want to speak about it ! '
'Well then , we won 't , ' Dolly hastened to say , noticing the look of pain on Anna 's face . ' But I see that you look at things too dismally . ' 
I am very cheerful and satisfied .
'Yes , to tell you the truth , I don 't like Veslovsky 's manner , ' said Dolly , wishing to change the subject .
'Oh , not at all !
It tickles Alexis , and that 's all ; he is only a boy and entirely in my hands ; you know , I manage him just as I please .
Dolly ! ' she said suddenly , changing her tone , ' you say I look at things too dismally ; you cannot understand .
It is too dreadful .
'But I think you ought to .
You must do all that is possible . ' 
Nothing !
You say I must marry Alexis , and that I don 't consider that .
I not consider that ! ' she repeated , and flushed .
She rose , drew herself up , sighed deeply , and with her light steps began pacing up and down the room , pausing occasionally . ' I not consider it ?
Not a day , not an hour passes without my thinking about it and blaming myself for what I think ... because those thoughts are enough to drive one mad !
To drive one mad ! ' she repeated . ' When I think of it I cannot fall asleep without morphia .
Let us discuss it quietly .
They speak of divorce .
For one thing , he would not agree now .
Dolly , sitting upright in her chair , with a pained expression of sympathy turned her head to follow Anna 's movements .
'One must try , ' she said gently .
'Let 's grant that .
Supposing I get his consent ... '
Anna at that instant had reached the other end of the room and stopped there , doing something to the window curtain .
'I receive his consent , and my so ... son ?
They will not give him to me .
He will grow up despising me , in the house of his father whom I have left .
Understand that I love equally , I think , and both more than myself - two beings : Serezha and Alexis . ' 
In her white dressing @-@ gown her figure appeared peculiarly tall and broad .
'I love those two beings only , and the one excludes the other !
I cannot unite them , yet that is the one thing I desire .
And if I can 't have that , nothing matters - nothing , nothing !
It will end somehow , therefore I can 't - I don 't like speaking about it .
So don 't reproach me , don 't condemn me for anything !
You in your purity cannot understand all I suffer ! '
She came and sat down beside Dolly , peering into her face with a guilty look , and took her by the hand .
'What are you thinking ?
What are you thinking of me ?
If anyone is unhappy , it is I ! ' she murmured , and , turning away , she wept .
Left alone , Dolly said her prayers and got into bed .
She had pitied Anna from the bottom of her heart while they were talking ; but now she could not make herself think about her .
Recollections of home and of her children rose in her imagination with a new and peculiar charm .
That world of her own now seemed so precious and dear that she did not wish on any account to spend another day away from it , and she decided certainly to go home on the morrow .
When she came in Vronsky regarded her attentively .
He tried to find some trace of the conversation which he knew , by her having remained so long in Dolly 's room , must have taken place .
He did not wish to ask her what they had been talking about , but hoped that she would tell him of her own accord .
However , she only said :
'I am glad you like Dolly .
But all the same I was very glad she came . ' 
He took Anna 's hand and looked inquiringly into her eyes .
She , misunderstanding that look , smiled at him .
Next morning , in spite of her hosts ' entreaties , Dolly prepared to go home .
Taking leave of the Princess Barbara and of the men was unpleasant to Dolly .
After spending a day together both she and her host felt distinctly that they did not suit one another and that it was better for them not to associate .
Only Anna felt sad .
She knew that when Dolly was gone no one would call up in her soul the feelings which had been aroused by their meeting .
To have those feelings awakened was painful , but still she knew that they were the best part of her soul , and that that part of her was rapidly being choked by the life she was leading .
When they had driven into the fields Dolly experienced a pleasant feeling of relief , and she was about to ask the men how they had liked the Vronskys ' place , when suddenly Philip the coachman himself remarked :
'They 're rich , that they are , but yet they gave us only two bushels of oats .
What 's two bushels ? Only a bite .
Nowadays oats are forty @-@ five kopeks at the inns .
'A stingy gentleman ... ' confirmed the clerk .
'Well , and did you like their horses ? ' asked Dolly .
But it did seem so dull to me , Darya Alexandrovna ! I don 't know how you found it , ' he added , turning his handsome , kindly face toward her .
Well , shall we get back by evening ? '
'We ought to . ' 
VRONSKY AND ANNA WENT ON LIVING IN THE COUNTRY in the same way , still taking no steps to obtain a divorce , all the summer and part of the autumn .
Their life seemed one that could not be improved upon : they had ample means , good health , a child , and both had occupations of their own .
In the absence of visitors Anna still continued to devote attention to her person , and read a great deal - both novels and such serious books as were in fashion .
She ordered all the books that were praised in the foreign newspapers and magazines they received , and read them with the attention one gives only to what one reads in solitude .
She studied also from books and from technical papers all the subjects with which Vronsky was occupied , so that he often came straight to her with questions about agriculture , architecture , and sometimes even horsebreeding or sport .
He was astounded at her knowledge and memory , and at first used to doubt her information and want it confirmed . She would then find what he wanted in books and show it him .
The arrangement of the hospital also interested her .
There she not only helped , but arranged and planned many things herself .
Nevertheless , her chief preoccupation was still herself - herself in so far as Vronsky held her dear and in so far as she could compensate him for all he had given up .
Vronsky appreciated this , which had become the sole aim of her life , a desire not only to please him but also to serve him ; but at the same time he was troubled by these love @-@ meshes in which she tried to entangle him .
As time went on , the oftener he felt himself caught in these meshes the more he desired , not exactly to escape from them but to try whether they really interfered with his freedom .
Had it not been for this ever @-@ increasing desire for freedom - not to have a scene each time he had to go to town to a meeting or to the races - Vronsky would have been quite content with his life .
His affairs , which occupied and absorbed him more and more , progressed excellently .
In spite of the tremendous sums the hospital , the machinery , the cows which he imported from Switzerland , and many other things were costing him , he was sure that he was not wasting his substance but increasing it .
Where it was a question of income - the sale of forest land , of corn or wool , or the leasing of land - Vronsky was as hard as flint and could hold out for his price .
In all operations on a large scale , both on this and on his other estates , he kept to the simplest and safest methods , and was extremely economical and careful in his expenditure on small details .
He listened to what the steward had to say and questioned him , but only consented when the things to be ordered or built were the latest , as yet unknown in Russia , and likely to astonish people .
Besides , he decided on a big outlay only when he had money to spare , and when spending he went into every detail and insisted on getting the very best for his money .
So that from the way he managed his business it was clear that he was not wasting but increasing his property .
In October there were the Nobility elections in the Kashin Province , in which Vronsky 's , Sviyazhsky 's , Koznyshev 's , and also a small part of Levin 's estates were situated .
Various circumstances , as well as the men who took part in them , caused these elections to attract public attention .
They were much discussed and preparations were made for them .
People living in Moscow and Petersburg as well as others from abroad , who had never come to any elections , assembled at these .
Vronsky had long ago promised Sviyazhsky to be present .
Before the elections Sviyazhsky , who often visited at Vozdvizhensk , called for Vronsky .
The day before , Vronsky and Anna had almost quarrelled about his proposed journey .
But , to his surprise , Anna took the news very quietly and only asked when he would return .
He looked at her attentively , not understanding this calm manner .
He knew her capacity for withdrawing into herself , and knew that she only did it when she had come to some resolution in her own mind without telling him of her plans .
He feared this , but he so wished to avoid a scene that he pretended to believe , and to some extent sincerely believed , in what he wished to believe , namely , in her reasonableness .
'I hope you won 't be dull ? '
No , I shan 't be dull . ' 
'She means to adopt this tone - well , so much the better ! ' thought he , ' or else it would be the usual thing again . ' 
And so , without challenging her to a frank explanation , he left for the elections .
It was the first time since their union that he had parted from her without a full explanation .
On the one hand this fact disturbed him , but on the other hand it seemed the best way .
'At first there will be , as now , something uncertain , something concealed ; but afterwards she will get used to it .
In any case I can give her everything else , but not my independence as a man , ' he reflected .
In September Levin moved to Moscow for Kitty 's confinement .
He had already been living there a whole month without occupation , when Sergius Ivanich Koznyshev , who had an estate in the Kashin Province and took a great interest in the forthcoming elections , prepared to attend them .
He asked his brother , who had a vote for the Seleznev district , to accompany him .
Levin was still wavering , but Kitty , who had noticed that he was dull in Moscow and had advised him to go , without saying anything to him ordered for him the uniform necessary for the occasion , which cost eighty roubles .
And it was these eighty roubles paid for the uniform which chiefly decided him .
So he went to Kashin .
Levin had been five days in Kashin , going daily to meetings and taking a great deal of trouble over his sister 's business , which he was still unable to arrange .
The Marshals of the Nobility were all busy with the elections , and he could not get even the simple matter in connection with the wardship settled .
The other business , that of getting the money paid , also met with obstacles .
He felt this frequently when talking to his very good @-@ natured legal adviser .
This legal adviser seemed to do all that was possible and to strain every nerve to get Levin out of his difficulties .
Everybody was kind and amiable , but still it turned out that what he wanted to circumvent started up again in another place and impeded him once more .
It was specially annoying to Levin to be quite unable to understand with whom he was contending , and whom the delay in his business could profit .
No one , not even his lawyer , seemed to know this .
He always sided with the Nobility in everything , openly opposed the spread of popular education , and gave a class character to the Zemstvo , which should have such enormous importance .
In the wealthy Province of Kashin , always ahead of all others , such forces were now assembled that , if matters were here managed as they should be , it might serve as an example to other Provinces and to the whole of Russia .
The affair was therefore of great importance .
To replace Snetkov as Marshal , Sviyazhsky was proposed , or , better still , Nevedovsky , an ex @-@ professor , a remarkably intelligent man , and a great friend of Koznyshev 's .
Levin , wishing to enter fully into everything and not to miss anything , stood there too in the crowd , and heard the Governor say : ' Please tell Mary Ivanovna that my wife is very sorry she has to go to the Orphanage . ' 
Then the noblemen gaily scrambled for their overcoats and all drove to the cathedral .
In the cathedral Levin , with the others , raised his hand , repeating the words of the priest , and swore by the most awful oaths to fulfil all the things the Governor had hoped for .
On the fourth day the audit of the Provincial Funds was undertaken , and now for the first time there was a conflict between the new and old parties .
The Commission entrusted with the task of auditing reported to the Assembly that the sums were all correct .
The nobles loudly applauded him and pressed his hand .
But at that moment one of the nobles of Koznyshev 's party said he had heard that the Commission had not audited the funds , considering that a verification would be an insult to the Marshal of the Province .
A member of the Commission imprudently confirmed this .
Thereupon the members of the Commission withdrew their report and Koznyshev began very logically to prove that they must admit either that they had audited the accounts or that they had not done so , and to elaborate this dilemma .
A speaker of the opposite party replied to Koznyshev .
Then Sviyazhsky spoke , and then the venomous gentleman once more .
Levin was surprised that they disputed about it so long , especially as , when he asked Koznyshev whether he thought that money had been misappropriated , he received the reply :
For some of the districts the election was stormy enough ; but for the Selezensk district Sviyazhsky was elected without opposition , and he gave a dinner party at his house that evening .
ON THE SIXTH DAY the Provincial elections were to be held .
The large and small halls were full of noblemen in various uniforms .
Many had come for that day only .
Men who had long not met - some from the Crimea , some from Petersburg , and some from abroad - came together in those halls .
By their external appearance the nobles were sharply divided into two sorts : the old and the young .
The old , for the most part , either wore old @-@ fashioned buttoned @-@ up uniforms of their class and carried swords and hats , or wore the naval , cavalry , or infantry uniforms to which each was individually entitled .
The uniforms of the old noblemen were cut in the old @-@ fashioned way , with puffs at the shoulders , and were clearly too small for them , being short @-@ waisted and narrow as if their wearers had grown out of them .
The young men wore long @-@ waisted loose uniforms wide across the shoulders with white waistcoats , or else were in uniforms with black collars embroidered with laurel leaves - the emblem of the Ministry of Justice .
To the young party also belonged the Court uniforms , which here and there ornamented the crowd .
But the division into young and old did not coincide with the separation into parties .
Some of the young ones , as Levin observed , belonged to the old party , and on the other hand some very aged noblemen conversed in whispers with Sviyazhsky and evidently were warm partisans of the new party .
Levin stood with his own group in the Small Hall , which was used as a refreshment and smoking room , listening to what was being said and vainly straining his mental powers to understand it all .
Koznyshev was the centre around whom the rest were grouped .
He was now listening to Sviyazhsky and Hlyustov , the Marshal of another district , who also belonged to their party .
Hlyustov was unwilling to go with the members for his district to invite Snetkov to stand again for election . Sviyazhsky was persuading him to do so and Koznyshev approved of this .
Levin did not see why his party should ask the Marshal to stand , when they wished to defeat him .
Oblonsky , who had just had something to eat and drink , came toward them in his Chamberlain 's uniform , wiping his mouth with his scented and bordered lawn handkerchief .
'We are holding the position , Sergius Ivanich ! ' said he , smoothing back his whiskers .
And after listening to the conversation he backed Sviyazhsky 's opinion .
'One district is sufficient , and Sviyazhsky evidently belongs to the Opposition , ' he said , and every one but Levin understood him .
'Well , Kostya ! You too seem to have got a taste for it ? ' he said , turning to Levin and taking him by the arm .
'O sancta simplicitas ! ' said Oblonsky , and briefly and clearly explained the matter to Levin .
'If , as in former elections , all the districts nominated the Provincial Marshal , he would be elected , receiving white balls from every one .
This we do not want .
Now eight districts are willing to invite him to stand again ; if two districts refuse to do so , Snetkov may decline to stand and then the old party might choose another of their members , and then all calculations would be upset .
But if only Sviyazhsky 's district does not invite him , Snetkov will stand .
He will even get a good number of votes , so that the Opposition will be misled , and when a candidate of ours stands they will give him some votes . ' 
LEVIN WAS STANDING SOME WAY OFF .
He could not hear distinctly because of the stertorous and hoarse breathing of one nobleman near him and the creaking of the stout shoes of another .
He could hear only the distant soft voice of the Marshal , then the shrill voice of the venomous nobleman , and then Sviyazhsky 's voice .
He waited for the venomous nobleman to conclude , and then said he considered the proper course would be to consult the wording of the Act and requested the Secretary to look it up .
The Act provided that in case of a difference of opinion the question should be balloted upon .
Koznyshev read the Act aloud , and began to explain its meaning , but a tall , thick @-@ set , round @-@ shouldered landowner with a dyed moustache , wearing a tight uniform the high collar of which squeezed up his neck at the back , interrupted him .
Advancing to the table he struck his ring against it , shouting in a loud voice :
'Vote !
Enough talking !
At this several voices were heard , and the tall landowner with the ring , growing more and more spiteful , shouted louder and louder ; but it was impossible to make out what he was saying .
Shouts arose , and for a moment there was such confusion that the Marshal had to call for order .
We shed our blood ...
Kindly ballot ! ...
Abominable ! ' was heard shouted by spiteful furious voices from every side .
They expressed implacable hatred .
Levin could not at all understand what was the matter , and was astounded at the ardour with which they discussed the question whether Flerov 's case should be put to the ballot or not .
'A single vote may decide the whole matter , and one must be serious and consistent if one wishes to be of public service , ' Koznyshev had said in conclusion .
But Levin had forgotten that , and it pained him to see these good men , whom he respected , in such an unpleasant , malevolent state of excitement .
To free himself from this feeling he went , without waiting to hear the end of the discussion , into the refreshment room , where there was no one except the waiters at the buffet .
He began pacing up and down the room , watching the waiters with pleasure .
He was particularly pleased by one old man with grey whiskers , who while evincing contempt for the young men who were making fun of him was teaching them how to fold napkins .
Levin was just preparing to start a conversation with the old waiter when the Secretary of the Court of Nobility , an old man whose speciality it was to know all the nobles of the Province by name and patronymic , diverted his attention .
'Please come , Constantine Dmitrich ! ' said he . ' Your brother is looking for you .
Levin entered the Hall , was given a white ball , and , following his brother , Sergius Ivanich , approached the table at which Sviyazhsky stood with an ironical and impressive look on his face , gathering his beard into his fist and smelling at it .
Koznyshev inserted his hand in the ballot @-@ box and placed his ball somewhere , and making way for Levin paused beside him .
Levin came up , but having entirely forgotten how the matter stood and being confused he turned to Koznyshev with the inquiry , ' Where am I to put it ? '
He spoke in a low voice at a time when people near by were talking , so he hoped his question would not be heard .
But the talk stopped and his improper question was heard .
Koznyshev frowned .
'That depends on each man 's convictions , ' he said severely .
Several persons smiled .
When he had done so he recollected that he ought to have put in his left hand also , and thrust it in , but it was too late ; and feeling still more confused he hurried away to the very back of the room .
'One hundred and twenty @-@ six for ' !
Flerov was qualified and the new party had scored .
But the old party did not consider itself defeated .
Levin heard Snetkov being asked to stand ; and he saw that a crowd of nobles surrounded the Marshal , who was speaking .
Replying to the nobles , Snetkov spoke of the confidence and affection of the Nobility , of which he was not worthy , his merit consisting only in his loyalty to the Nobility , to whom he had devoted twenty years of service .
Several times he repeated the words : ' have served to the extent of my power - faithfully and truly - I appreciate and thank ... ' Then suddenly choked by tears , he stopped , and left the room .
In the doorway the Marshal came into collision with Levin .
'Sorry ! Please excuse me ! ' he said , speaking as to a stranger ; but , recognizing Levin , he smiled timidly .
It seemed to Levin that Snetkov wished to say something but could not speak from agitation .
The expression of his face and his whole figure , in uniform with crosses and white trousers trimmed with gold lace , as he went hurriedly along , reminded Levin of a hunted animal conscious that things are going badly with him .
This expression on the Marshal 's face touched Levin , particularly because , just the day before , he had been to his house about the wardship and had there seen him in all the dignity of a kind @-@ hearted family man .
Now the old man seemed touching and pathetic to Levin and he wished to say something pleasant to him .
'So you are to be our Marshal again , ' said he .
'Hardly ! ' replied the Marshal , looking round with a frightened expression . ' I am tired and old .
And the Marshal disappeared through a side @-@ door .
The most solemn moment had arrived .
The elections were about to begin .
'I have brought one . I soused him , ' said the landowner who had been to fetch him , approaching Sviyazhsky . ' He 'll do . ' 
'He 's not very drunk - he won 't fall down ? ' asked Sviyazhsky , swaying his head .
'No , he 's fine .
I told the man at the bar on no account to let him have anything ! '
THE . NARROW ROOM IN WHICH THEY WERE EATING arid smoking was full of noblemen .
The excitement was ever increasing and anxiety was noticeable on all the faces .
Especially excited were the leaders , who knew all the details and the estimates of votes .
They were directors of the impending battle .
The others , like the rank and file before a battle , though preparing for the fight , sought distraction meanwhile .
Some of them ate , standing or hastily sitting down at the table , others smoked cigarettes , pacing up and down the long room , and talked to friends they had not seen for a long time .
Levin had noticed him at the elections the day before and had carefully avoided meeting him .
He went to the window and sat down , looking at the different groups and listening to what was being said around him .
'He is such a rascal !
I told him not to !
And casting a discontented glance at Levin , he suddenly turned away .
'Yes , it 's a dirty business , say what you will , ' remarked an undersized man with a feeble voice .
Following those two a whole crowd of landowners surrounding a stout General , hastily approached Levin .
Obviously they were seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard .
'How dare he say I gave orders to steal his trousers ?
I expect he drank them .
I snap my fingers at him and his princely title !
'What the devil do I care about the statute ?
I speak frankly .
'Come , your Excellency ! A glass of fine champagne ! '
Another group followed close on the heels of a nobleman who was shouting loudly . He was one of those who had been made drunk .
'I always advised Mary Semenovna to let her estate , because she will never make it pay , ' said a pleasant @-@ voiced landowner with a grey moustache , wearing the uniform of Colonel of the former General Staff .
It was the landowner Levin had met at Sviyazhsky 's house .
He knew him at once .
The landowner also recognized Levin and they shook hands .
'Very pleased to see you !
Of course I remember you very well .
Last year , at Sviyazhsky the Marshal 's house . ' 
'Well , how is your husbandry getting on ? ' Levin inquired .
'I must confess to you that I only imperfectly understand the meaning of these Nobility elections , ' said Levin .
The landowner looked at him .
'But what is there to understand ?
It has no meaning whatever .
The Nobility is an obsolete institution which continues to act through inertia .
Look at the uniforms ! They tell the tale : this is an assembly of Justices of the Peace , permanent officials , and so on , but not of nobles ! '
'Then why do you come ? asked Levin .
'From habit , for one thing .
It 's a sort of moral obligation .
And then , to tell the truth , I have a private reason .
But why do such gentlemen come ? ' he went on , indicating the venomous gentleman who had spoken at the Provincial table .
They are landowners ; we are country squires .
'But you say it is an obsolete institution ! '
'It is obsolete certainly ; but all the same one should treat it more respectfully .
Whether we are good or bad , we have been growing for a thousand years .
It can 't be grown in a year , ' he remarked cautiously , immediately changing the subject . ' Well , and how is your husbandry getting on ? '
You know you too are worth something !
Now , take me .
Before I took to farming I was getting three thousand roubles a year in the Service .
Now I work harder than I did in the Service , and like yourself I clear about five per cent . , and that only with luck .
'Then why do you go on with it , if it is a clear loss ? '
It 's a habit , and one knows that it 's necessary !
'Yes , yes , ' said Levin , ' that is quite so !
I always feel that I am getting no real profit out of my estate and yet I go on ...
One feels a sort of duty toward the land . ' 
'I 'll tell you something , ' continued the landowner . ' My neighbour , a merchant , called on me , and we went over the farm and garden together .
He said , " Everything is going as it should , only your garden is neglected , " though my garden is quite in order .
" If I were you , I should cut down those limes , but it must be done when the sap rises .
And the trunks could be cut up for log huts ! " '
'You are married , I hear ? ' said the landowner .
The landowner smiled under his grey moustache .
'But why don 't we do like the merchant ?
Why don 't we cut down our limes for bast ? ' said Levin , returning to the thought that had struck him .
'Why , as you have said , we guard the fire !
Our work is not done here , at the elections , but at our homes .
We have a class instinct as to what should not be done .
I see it in the peasants too sometimes : a proper peasant always tries to get hold of as much land as possible .
However bad the land , still he ploughs it .
'Just like us , ' said Levin . ' Very , very glad to have met you , ' he added , seeing Sviyazhsky approaching .
'We two have met for the first time since we were at your house , ' said the landowner , ' and have indulged in a chat . ' 
'Yes , and have you been abusing the new order ? ' asked Sviyazhsky with a smile .
SVIYAZHSKY TOOK Levin 's arm and led him back to his own group .
This time it was impossible to avoid Vronsky .
He was standing with Oblonsky and Koznyshev , and looked straight at Levin as he came up .
'Very pleased !
I think I had the pleasure of meeting you ... at the Princess Shcherbatsky 's ? ' said he , holding out his hand to Levin .
'Yes , I well remember our meeting , ' said Levin , and blushing scarlet immediately turned and spoke to his brother .
'What is delaying matters now ? ' asked Levin glancing at Sviyazhsky and Vronsky .
He must either decline or accept , ' replied Sviyazhsky .
'That 's just it : neither the one nor the other , ' answered Vronsky .
'And if he should refuse , who will stand ? ' asked Levin , looking at Vronsky .
'Whoever likes , ' replied Sviyazhsky .
'Will you ? ' asked Levin .
'Certainly not I , ' said Sviyazhsky , becoming embarrassed and casting an alarmed glance at the venomous gentleman , who was standing beside Koznyshev .
Nevedovsky ? ' said Levin , feeling that he had put his foot in it somehow .
But this was still worse .
Nevedovsky and Sviyazhsky were the two prospective candidates .
'Not I , not on any account ! ' said the venomous gentleman .
So this was Nevedovsky !
Sviyazhsky introduced him to Levin .
'Well , has it touched you to the quick too ? ' said Oblonsky , winking at Vronsky . ' It 's like the races .
'Yes , it does touch one to the quick , ' replied Vronsky , ' and having once taken the matter up , one wants to carry it through .
It 's a struggle ! ' he said frowning , and closed his powerful jaw .
'What a capable man Sviyazhsky is !
'Oh yes , ' replied Vronsky absent @-@ mindedly .
'And how is it that you , living constantly in the country ; are not a Justice of the Peace ?
'Because I consider that the Magistracy is an idiotic institution , ' morosely replied Levin , who had all the time been looking for an opportunity of speaking to Vronsky , to atone for his rudeness at their first encounter .
'I don 't think so ; on the contrary ... ' said Vronsky with calm surprise .
'It 's a game , ' Levin interrupted . ' We don 't need any Justices of the Peace .
I have not had a single case in eight years , and when I did have one it was decided wrongly .
The Justice 's Court is forty versts from my house .
To settle a matter worth two roubles I should have to send an attorney who costs me fifteen . ' 
And he related how a peasant stole some flour from a miller , and how when the miller spoke to him about it the peasant sued him for libel .
All this was untimely and foolish , and Levin himself was conscious of it even while he spoke .
'Oh , he is such a crank ! ' said Oblonsky with his smoothest and most almondy smile . ' But come ! I think the ballot has begun ... '
And they separated .
'I don 't understand , ' said Koznyshev , who had observed his brother 's awkward sally , ' I don 't understand how one can be so entirely devoid of political tact !
That is what we Russians lack .
But Count Vronsky ... I do not make a friend of him ; he invited me to dinner and I shan 't go ; but he is one of our party , so why make an enemy of him ?
Then you ask Nevedovsky whether he will stand .
'Oh , I understand nothing about it !
It is all trifling , ' said Levin , gloomily .
'There , you say it 's all trifling , but when you begin on it you make a mess of everything . ' 
Levin remained silent and they entered the Large Hall together .
The Marshal of the Province , though he felt in the air that there was a plot prepared against him , and though he had not been unanimously asked to stand , had still decided to do so .
The District Marshals carried little plates filled with ballot balls from their own tables to the Provincial table , and the election began .
But Levin had forgotten the plan which had been explained to him , and was afraid that Oblonsky was making a mistake when he said ' right . ' 
Surely Snetkov was their opponent !
While approaching the box he had the ball in his right hand , but , thinking it was a mistake , he shifted it to his left hand just as he reached the box , and evidently placed it to the left .
There was nothing for him to exercise his penetration upon this time .
Then a solitary voice proclaimed the number for and against .
The Marshal had received a considerable majority .
A clamour arose and every one rushed to the door .
Snetkov entered and the noblemen thronged around him with congratulations .
'Well , is it over now ? ' Levin asked his brother .
'It 's only beginning ! ' Sviyazhsky smilingly answered for Koznyshev . ' The other candidate may get still more votes . ' 
Levin had again forgotten about that .
He only now remembered that there was some subtlety in it , but he was too bored to recollect what it was .
He was overcome by depression and wanted to get out of that crowd .
As no one was paying any attention to him , and he apparently was not wanted by anybody , he went quietly to the small refreshment @-@ room and again felt great relief when he saw the waiters .
The old waiter offered him something to eat and Levin accepted .
Having eaten a cutlet and beans , and talked with the old man about his former masters , Levin , not wishing to return to the hall where he had felt so out of his element , went up into the gallery .
The gallery was crowded with smartly @-@ dressed women who leaned over the balustrade and tried not to miss a single word of what was being said below .
Beside the women sat or stood elegant lawyers , spectacled High School teachers , and officers .
Every one was talking about the elections and how tired out the Marshal was and how interesting the debates had been . In one group Levin heard them praising his brother .
'How glad I am to have heard Koznyshev !
It was worth while going a little hungry .
So clear and audible !
There now , no one speaks like that in your Court - except perhaps Maydel , and even he is far less eloquent ! '
Having found a vacant place at the balustrade , Levin leant over and began to look and listen .
The noblemen were sitting behind partitions , arranged according to their districts .
'As candidate for the post of Provincial Marshal , Captain Eugene Ivanich Apukhtin will now be balloted for . ' 
Then followed a dead silence , and a feeble voice was heard saying :
'Declines , ' shouted a youthful squeaky voice .
A similar announcement was made , and again followed by ' Declines . ' 
Levin , leaning over the balustrade , looked on and listened .
At first he was surprised and wanted to understand what it meant ; then , coming to the conclusion that he could not understand it , he grew bored .
Then , remembering the agitation and anger he had witnessed on all faces , he felt sad , and with the intention of leaving the place went downstairs .
On the stairs he met a couple : a lady running up swiftly in her high @-@ heeled shoes , and the Assistant Public Prosecutor .
'I said you would be in time , ' the Assistant said , as Levin stepped aside to let the lady pass .
Levin was already descending the stairs to the exit and getting out his cloakroom ticket when the Secretary caught him . ' Please come , Constantine Dmitrich ! They are voting ! '
Levin went up to the door of the hall : it was locked .
The Secretary knocked , the door opened and two landowners with flushed faces plunged out past Levin .
'I can 't stand it ! ' cried one of the red @-@ faced landowners .
His face was dreadful from its expression of exhaustion and fear .
'I told you to let no one out ! ' he shouted to the doorkeeper . ' I was letting people in , Your Excellency ! '
'Oh , Lord ! ' said the Marshal of the Province with a deep sigh ; and with his weary legs in the white trousers dragging , and hanging his head , he went down the middle of the hall to the chief table .
Nevedovsky had a majority as they had expected and he was now Marshal of the Province .
Many were cheerful , many contented and happy , many were in ecstasy and many dissatisfied and miserable .
The old Marshal was in despair and could not hide it .
THE NEWLY @-@ ELECTED MARSHAL , of the Province and many of the victorious new party dined that evening at Vronsky 's .
But he had not at all expected that the election business would interest him so much and so touch him to the quick , or that he could do it so well .
He was quite a new man in this circle of noble landowners , but he evidently was a success ; and he was not mistaken in thinking that he had already gained influence among them .
He saw clearly , and others acknowledged , that he had contributed very much to Nevedovsky 's success .
Now , at his own table , celebrating Nevedovsky 's election , Vronsky experienced a pleasant feeling of triumph .
They were now celebrating the jockey 's victory .
Vronsky sat at the head of the table ; on his right was the young Governor , a General of the Emperor 's suite .
On Vronsky 's left sat Nevedovsky with his youthful , dogged , and venomous look .
Toward him Vronsky was simple and courteous .
Sviyazhsky bore his failure cheerfully .
It was not even a failure for him ; as he himself said to Nevedovsky , champagne glass in hand , no better representative of the new course which the Nobility ought to follow could have been found .
And therefore all that was honest , as he remarked , was on the side of to @-@ day 's success and triumphed in it .
Oblonsky too was pleased that he had spent his time merrily and that every one was satisfied .
Sviyazhsky comically mimicked the old Marshal 's tearful speech and , turning to Nevedovsky , remarked that His Excellency would have to adopt a different and more complex method of auditing the funds than tears !
During the dinner they continually spoke of Nevedovsky as ' Our Provincial Marshal ' and addressed him as ' Your Excellency . ' 
This was uttered with the same pleasure with which a newly @-@ married woman is addressed as Madame and called by her husband 's name .
During the dinner several telegrams were sent to persons interested in the elections .
Oblonsky , who was feeling very jolly , sent one to Dolly which ran as follows : ' Nevedovsky elected by majority of twenty .
He dictated it aloud , saying , ' I must cheer them up ! '
But Dolly , on receiving the telegram , only sighed over the rouble it had cost , and understood that it had been sent toward the end of a dinner .
Everything , including the splendid dinner and the wines - which did not come from Russian merchants but were imported ready @-@ bottled from abroad - was very distinguished , simple , and gay .
The company of twenty men had been selected by Sviyazhsky from adherents of the new movement and from Liberals , men who were also witty and respectable .
Healths were drunk , also half in jest , to the new Provincial Marshal , to the Governor , to the Bank Director , and to ' our amiable host . ' 
Vronsky was satisfied .
'There will be a ball afterwards and you will see our Society beauty !
'Not in my line , ' answered Vronsky , who was fond of that English expression , but he smiled and promised to come .
'From Vozdvizhensk , by express messenger , ' he said with a significant glance .
'It is extraordinary how much he resembles the Public Prosecutor Sventitsky , ' remarked one of the guests in French of the valet , while Vronsky , frowning , read his letter .
The letter was from Anna .
Even before he read it he knew its contents .
Expecting the elections to end in five days , he had promised to return on the Friday .
It was now Saturday , and he knew that the letter contained reproaches for his not having returned punctually .
The letter he had sent off the evening before had probably not yet reached her .
The contents of the letter were just what he expected , but its form was unexpected and particularly unpleasant to him .
'Annie is very ill . The doctor says it may be inflammation .
I expected you the day before yesterday , and yesterday , and am now sending to find out where you are and what the matter is .
I wished to come myself , but changed my mind knowing that you would not like it .
Give me some reply that I may know what to do . ' 
Baby was ill , and she wished to come herself ?
Their child ill , and this hostile tone !
The innocent mirth of the elections and this dismal burdensome love to which he must return struck Vronsky by their contrast .
But he had to go , and he took the first train that night for his home .
But the cold , stern look on his face when he came to tell her he was going offended her , and even before he had gone her composure was upset .
Later on , meditating in solitude on that look - which expressed his right to freedom - she , as usual , came only to a consciousness of her own humiliation .
'He has the right to go when and where he pleases .
Not only to go away , but to leave me .
But , knowing this , he ought not to do it !
He has looked at me coldly and severely .
Of course it is indefinable , intangible , but it was not so formerly , and that look means much , ' she thought . ' That look shows that he is beginning to grow cold . ' 
Though she was convinced that this was the case , she could not do anything , could not in any way change her relation to him .
True , there was one means , not of holding him - for that purpose she wished for nothing except his love - but of putting herself in such a position that he could not abandon her .
That means was divorce and marriage .
She began to wish for this , and decided to agree the first time he or Steve should mention it to her .
With these thoughts in her mind she spent five days , the days she expected him to be away .
Walks , talks with the Princess Barbara , visits to the hospital , and above all reading , reading one book after another , filled her time .
But on the sixth day , when the coachman returned from the station without him , she felt that she was no longer able to stifle the thought of him and of what he was doing .
Just then her little girl fell ill .
Anna nursed her , but this did not divert her thoughts especially as the illness was not dangerous .
Next morning she received his letter and regretted her own .
She anticipated with horror a repetition of that stern look he had thrown at her when leaving , especially when he should learn that the little girl was not dangerously ill .
Anna now acknowledged to herself that he was weary of her and would regret giving up his freedom to return to her ; yet in spite of this she was glad that he would come .
Let him feel weary , but let him be here with her so that she might see him and know his every movement .
She was sitting in the drawing @-@ room , reading by lamplight a new book by Taine , listening to the wind outside , and expecting every moment the arrival of the carriage .
Several times she had thought she heard the sound of wheels but had been mistaken ; at last she heard not only the wheels but also the coachman 's voice and a dull rumbling in the portico .
Even the Princess Barbara , who was playing patience , confirmed this , and Anna , flushing , rose , but instead of going downstairs , as she had already done twice , she stood still .
She suddenly felt ashamed of having deceived him and still more afraid of how he might treat her .
The feeling of injury had already passed , and she only feared the expression of his displeasure .
She remembered that the child had been quite well since yesterday .
She was even vexed with her for having recovered as soon as the letter had been sent .
Then she recollected that he was here , all of him , his hands , his eyes .
She heard his voice , and forgetting everything else ran joyfully to meet him .
He was sitting on a chair , and the footman was pulling off his warm boots .
'And you ? ' he asked , giving himself a shake .
She took his hand in both hers and drew it to her waist , not taking her eyes off him .
'Well , I 'm very glad , ' he said , coldly surveying her coiffure and the dress which , he knew , she had put on for him .
All this pleased him , but it had already pleased him so often !
And the stern and stony look , which she so dreaded , settled on his face .
And you are well ? ' said he , wiping his wet beard with his handkerchief , and kissing her hand .
'No matter , ' she thought , ' if only he is here . When he is here he can 't and daren 't fail to love me ! '
The evening passed happily and cheerfully in the company of the Princess Barbara , who complained to him that in his absence Anna had been taking morphia .
'What am I to do ?
I could not sleep ...
He told her about the elections , and Anna knew how by questions to lead him on to just what pleased him - his success .
She told him about everything that interested him at home , and all her news was most cheerful .
But late at night , when they were alone , Anna , seeing that she had regained full mastery of him , wanted to efface the depressing impression of the look he gave her apropos of the letter , and said :
'But confess that you were vexed to get my letter , and did not believe me ? '
As soon as she had said this she knew that , however lovingly disposed he might be to her , he had not forgiven her for that letter .
'Yes , ' he answered . ' It was such a strange letter .
Annie was ill , yet you wished to come yourself ! '
'That was all true . ' 
'I don 't doubt it . ' 
I see you are displeased . ' 
'Not for a moment .
I am only displeased , really , that you seem not to wish to admit that there are duties ... '
'Don 't let us talk about it , ' he said .
'Why should we not talk about it ? ' she replied .
'I only wished to say that one may have unavoidable business .
Now , for instance , I shall have to go to Moscow about the house ...
Oh , Anna , why are you so irritable ?
Don 't you know that I can 't live without you ? '
'If that is so , ' replied Anna in a suddenly changed voice , ' it must be that you are weary of this life ...
Yes , you will come for a day and go away again , as men do ... '
'Anna , that is cruel .
'If you go to Moscow , I shall go too !
I will not stop here .
Either we must separate or live together . ' 
'You know that that is my desire !
But for that ... '
But I will go to Moscow with you . ' 
'You speak as if you were threatening me !
Why , I don 't wish for anything so much as not to be separated from you , ' said Vronsky , smilingly .
But not a cold look only but the angry look of a hunted and exasperated man flashed in his eyes as he spoke those tender words .
The look said , ' If so , this is a misfortune ! '
It was a momentary impression , but she never forgot it .
Anna wrote to her husband asking him for a divorce and at the end of November , having parted from the Princess Barbara , who had to go to Petersburg , she moved to Moscow with Vronsky .
Daily expecting Karenin 's reply , to be followed by a divorce , they now established themselves like a married couple .
PART VII
THE LEVINS HAD BEEN MORE THAN TWO MONTHS IN MOSCOW .
The doctor , the midwife , Dolly , her mother , and especially Levin ( who could not think without horror of what was coming ) , began to experience impatience and anxiety ; Kitty alone was perfectly calm and happy .
She now distinctly realized the awakening of a new sense of tenderness for the coming ( and for her to some extent already existing ) child , and she yielded with pleasure to that feeling .
It was no longer entirely part of herself , but now and then lived its own independent life .
Sometimes this occasioned her pain , but at the same time she wanted to laugh because of this strange new joy .
The only thing that marred the charm of this life was that her husband was not as she loved him best , not as he used to be in the country .
She loved his quiet , kindly and hospitable manner on his estate .
In town he always seemed restless and on his guard , as if afraid lest some one should insult him or , worse still , her .
Here in town he was always in a hurry , as if fearing to miss something , and yet he had nothing to do .
She was sorry for him .
But she understood him not from without but from within and saw that in town he was not himself ; she could not otherwise define his condition .
Sometimes in her heart she reproached him for not knowing how to live in town ; at other times she confessed that it was really hard for him to arrange his life here satisfactorily .
Indeed , what could he do ?
He did not care for cards .
She knew now what consorting with gay people of Oblonsky 's sort meant - it meant drinking and then driving somewhere ...
She could not think without horror of where men drove to in such cases .
But she knew that to do so he would have to find pleasure in being with young women and she could not wish that .
Stay at home with her and her mother and sisters ?
Then what was left for him to do ?
Continue to write his book ?
And he also complained that he had talked too much about his book here , so that all his ideas had become confused and he had lost interest in them .
The one advantage of this town @-@ life was that here they never quarrelled .
An event even occurred of great importance to them both in this respect , namely , Kitty 's meeting with Vronsky .
The old Princess , Mary Borisovna , Kitty 's godmother , who had always been very fond of her , particularly wished to see her .
Though Kitty was not going out anywhere because of her condition , yet she went with her father to see the venerable old lady , and there met Vronsky .
But this lasted only a few seconds .
She exchanged a few words with Vronsky , and even smiled at a joke he made about the elections , to which he alluded as ' our parliament . ' 
( She had to smile to show that she understood the joke . )
She was pleased with herself .
Levin blushed much more than she had done when she told him she had met Vronsky at the Princess Mary Borisovna 's .
It was very difficult for her to tell him this , and still more difficult to go on giving him details of the meeting , as he did not ask anything , but only frowned and looked at her .
'I am very sorry you were not there , ' she said ; ' I don 't mean present in the room ... I should not have behaved so naturally with you there ...
I am now blushing much more - much , much more , ' she added , blushing to tears , ' but I am sorry you could not look through a crack . ' 
Her truthful eyes told Levin that she was satisfied with herself , and in spite of her blushes he grew calm at once and began questioning her , which was just what she wanted .
'It is so painful to think that there is a man who is almost my enemy , - whom I dislike to meet , ' said Levin . ' I am very , very glad ! '
'Only going to see Katavasov , ' answered Levin .
'He promised to introduce me to Metrov .
I want to have a talk with him about my work . He is a celebrated Petersburg scholar , ' replied Levin .
'Oh yes ! It was his article you praised so ?
'Then I may call round at the Courts about my sister 's case . ' 
'Oh yes , do go ! They are giving those new pieces ...
It used to interest you so .
I should certainly go . ' 
'Well , in any case I will come back before dinner , ' he said , glancing at his watch .
'Is it absolutely necessary then ? '
'Yes , absolutely !
'Well , will you believe it ? I have got so out of the habit that it makes me feel ashamed .
A stranger arrives , sits down , remains a while doing nothing , disturbs them , upsets himself , and goes away again . ' 
'But as a bachelor you used to pay calls ? ' she said .
'I did , but I always felt ashamed , and now I am so out of the habit of it that , seriously , I would rather go without dinner for two days than pay that call !
I will vouch for that ! ' said Kitty , looking laughingly into his face .
Please call on them ! '
He was about to go after kissing her hand , when she stopped him .
'Kostya , do you know I have only fifty roubles left ? '
How much ? ' he asked , with a dissatisfied look familiar to her .
'No , wait a moment . ' She held him by the hand .
There is something we don 't do right . ' 
'Not at all , ' he said , coughing and looking at her from under his brows .
She knew that cough .
With him it was a sign of great displeasure , not with her but with himself .
He was really dissatisfied , not because they had spent so much but because he had been reminded of a matter which , well knowing that something was wrong , he wished to forget .
'I have told Sokolov to sell the wheat and draw the money for the mill in advance .
'Yes , but I 'm afraid that in general too much ... '
'Not at all , not at all ! ' he repeated . ' Well , good @-@ bye , darling ! '
'But , really , sometimes I am sorry I listened to Mama !
How nice it would have been in the country !
As it is I have worn you all out , and we are wasting money ... '
Not once since our marriage have I said to myself that things might have been better than they are ... '
'Is that true ? ' she said , looking into his eyes .
He had said it without thinking , to comfort her .
But when he looked and saw those dear , truthful eyes questioningly fixed on him , he repeated the words from the bottom of his heart .
'Decidedly I am forgetting her , ' he thought , remembering what was so soon awaiting them .
'Will it be soon ?
How do you feel ? ' he whispered , taking both her hands in his .
'I have so often thought so , that now I have given up thinking . ' 
She smiled contemptuously .
'Not an atom ! ' she answered .
We will call at Dolly 's .
I 'll expect you before dinner ...
Do you know , Dolly 's situation is becoming quite impossible !
It is quite impossible .
We can 't speak to Papa about it ...
But if you and he ... '
'But what can we do ? ' said Levin .
'Well , anyhow , you will see Arseny . Have a talk with him , and he will tell you what we decided . ' 
'I 'm ready to agree with Arseny beforehand .
At the porch Kuzma , an old servant of his bachelor days , who was now managing the household in town , stopped Levin .
'Krasavchik ' ( one of the pair of carriage horses brought from the country ) ' has been re @-@ shod but still goes lame , ' said he . ' What are your orders ? '
He wanted to arrange the matter as well and as cheaply as possible ; but it turned out that their own horses cost them more than hired ones would have done , and they hired horses as well .
'Send for the vet , maybe it 's a bruise . ' 
'Yes , and what will Catherine Alexandrovna do ? ' asked Kuzma .
Now all this seemed quite natural .
And , thanks to the conditions of town life , having thus simply and easily solved a difficulty which in the country would have required much exertion and personal attention , Levin went out , called an izvoshchik , and drove to the Nikitskaya .
On his way he thought no more about money , but considered how he could make the acquaintance of the Petersburg scholar , who was studying sociology , and how he would talk to him about his book .
Only during the very first days in Moscow had the unproductive but inevitable expenditure , so strange to country folk , yet demanded on all sides , startled Levin .
Now he was used to it .
The notes he now changed no longer evoked such calculations , but flew away like wee birds .
Whether the pleasure afforded by what it purchased corresponded to the labour expended in acquiring the money was a consideration long since lost sight of .
His farming calculations that there is a price below which certain grain must not be sold were forgotten too .
The rye - after he had so long held out for a certain price - was sold fifty kopeks a chetvert cheaper than had been offered him a month ago .
Even the calculation that it would be impossible to live for a year at that rate of expenditure without running into debt - even that calculation had lost its meaning .
The one thing needful was to have money in the bank , without asking whence it came , so as to be always sure of the wherewithal to get to @-@ morrow 's beef .
Till now he had always observed that rule ; he had always had money in the bank .
But now he had no money remaining there , and did not quite know where to get any .
It was this that had upset him for a moment when Kitty reminded him about money ; however , he had no time to think about it .
While driving he thought of Katavasov and of making Metrov 's acquaintance .
DURING HIS STAY IN Moscow Levin had renewed his intimacy with his fellow @-@ student of university days , now Professor Katavasov , whom he had not seen since his marriage .
He liked Katavasov because of his clear and simple outlook on life .
Levin had read some parts of his book to Katavasov , who liked it .
'Decidedly you are improving - quite a pleasure to see it , ' said Katavasov as he welcomed Levin in the little drawing @-@ room . ' I heard the bell and thought " It 's impossible he can have come punctually .... "
They are born warriors ! '
Katavasov in a few words told him the latest news , and , taking him into the study , introduced Levin to a tall , sturdy , and very agreeable @-@ looking man .
It was Metrov .
The conversation rested for a time on politics and on how the highest circles in Petersburg regarded the latest events .
Metrov quoted words an the subject attributed to the Emperor and one of the Ministers , which he had from a reliable source .
Katavasov , however , had heard with equal definiteness that the Emperor said something quite different .
Levin tried to imagine a situation in which both utterances might have been made , and the subject was dropped .
'That is very interesting , ' said Metrov .
'But in what do you perceive the peculiar quality of the Russian worker ? ' asked Metrov . ' In his zoological qualities , so to say , or in the conditions in which he is placed ? '
To illustrate this theory he hastened to add that , in his opinion , the Russian people view results from their consciousness of a vocation to populate the vast unoccupied tracts in the East .
'It is easy to be led astray when drawing conclusions as to the general vocation of a people , ' said Metrov , interrupting Levin . ' The condition of the labourer will always depend on his relation to land and capital . ' 
And without letting Levin finish explaining his idea , Metrov began expounding to him the peculiarity of his own teaching .
He wanted to interrupt Metrov and to state his own idea , which he considered would render a further statement of Metrov 's view superfluous .
But afterwards , having convinced himself that they looked at the question so differently that they would never understand one another , he ceased making objections and merely listened .
Though what Metrov was saying now no longer interested him at all , he felt some pleasure all the same in hearing him .
'I 'm afraid we shall be late , ' said Katavasov , glancing at the clock as soon as Metrov had finished his disquisition .
I have promised to read a paper on his work on Zoology .
I should very much like to hear your work . ' 
They began a conversation about a controversy in the university , which was one of the most important events in Moscow that winter .
This resolution was , in the opinion of some people , a dreadful one , while according to others it was very simple and just . The professors were divided into two camps .
The side to which Katavasov belonged accused their opponents of mean treachery and deception ; while the others imputed youthfulness and disrespect for authority .
The meeting had already begun .
At the table covered with a cloth at which Katavasov and Metrov took their seats six men were sitting , and one of them , with his head bent close over a manuscript , was reading something .
Levin took one of the vacant chairs which were standing round the table , and in a whisper asked a student who was sitting there what was being read .
With a displeased look at Levin the student replied :
'The biography ! '
Though the biography of the scientist did not interest Levin , he listened involuntarily and learned a few interesting facts about the celebrated man 's life .
When the reader had finished , the chairman thanked him and read aloud some verses for the jubilee sent by the poet Ment , adding a few words of thanks to the poet .
When Katavasov had finished , Levin looked at his watch , saw that it was getting on for two , and thought that there would be no time to read his manuscript to Metrov before the concert , and besides , he no longer felt inclined to do so .
During the readings he had also been thinking about the talk they had had .
Making up his mind to decline Metrov 's invitation , therefore , Levin approached him as soon as the meeting ended .
Metrov introduced him to the chairman , with whom he was discussing the political news .
After that they began talking about the university question .
As Levin had already heard all that , he hastened to tell Metrov that he regretted he was unable to accept his invitation , shook hands , and drove off to the Lvovs ' .
LVOV , WHO WAS MARRIED to Kitty 's sister Nataly , had passed all his life in the capitals and abroad , where he had been educated and where he had been in the diplomatic service .
Despite very acute differences in their habits and opinions , and the fact that Lvov was older than Levin , they became very intimate and attached to one another that winter .
Levin found Lvov at home , and entered unannounced .
His handsome , refined , and still young @-@ looking face , to which the curly , glossy , silver hair gave a still more well @-@ bred appearance , lit up with a smile when he saw Levin .
He rose and pushed forward a rocking @-@ chair . ' Have you read the last circular in the Journal de St Petersbourg ?
I think it splendid , ' said he with a slightly French accent .
Levin told him what he had heard from Katavasov of what was said in Petersburg , and , after some talk on politics , Levin recounted how he had made Metrov 's acquaintance and had gone to the meeting .
This interested Lvov very much .
'Oh , yes !
Even for the children 's lessons I often have to refresh my memory , or even simply to learn things .
For it is not enough to have masters , one must have a supervisor as well , just as you have both labourers and an overseer on your estate .
I was just reading , ' and he showed Levin Buslaev 's Grammar which lay on the lectern . ' They expect Misha to know this , and it is so difficult ...
He says here ... '
Levin tried to explain that it is impossible to understand it and that it must just be learnt by heart ; but Lvov did not agree with him .
'Yes ! You laugh at it ! '
'On the contrary ! You have no idea how , when I see you , I am always learning what awaits me - the education of my children . ' 
'Oh , come ! You 've nothing to learn from me ! ' said Lvov .
'All I know is that I never saw better brought up children than yours , ' said Levin , ' and do not wish for better children . ' 
Lvov evidently tried to restrain the expression of his delight , but a radiant smile lit up his face .
'If only they turn out better than I !
That is all I desire .
You do not yet know all the difficulties one has with boys who , like mine , have been neglected through our life abroad , ' said he .
They are such gifted children !
That is what I learn by watching your children . ' 
'You talk of moral training !
You can 't imagine how difficult that is !
You have hardly mastered one fault when another crops up and there is a fresh struggle .
One must have the support of religion - you remember our talk about that ? ... No father relying on his own strength , without that support , could educate a child . ' 
I am dining with you to @-@ day .
Look here , Arseny , ' she said , turning to her husband , ' you will take the carriage ... '
Levin , as one of the family , had to take part in the deliberations .
'He spoils me , you know , ' said Lvov to his wife , indicating Levin . ' He assures me that our children are splendid , though I see so much that is bad in them . ' 
'Arseny goes to extremes , as I always tell him , ' said his wife . ' If you look for perfection , you will never be satisfied .
Nowadays parents are hardly allowed to live , and everything is for the children . ' 
'Why not , if that is pleasanter ? ' said Lvov with his handsome smile , touching her hand . ' Those who don 't know you would think you were not a mother but a stepmother ! '
'No , extremes are not right in any case , ' said Nataly quietly , putting his paper @-@ knife in its right place on the table .
'Ah ! Come here , you perfect children ! ' said Lvov to two little boys , who , after bowing to Levin , approached their father , evidently wishing to ask him something .
Levin had forgotten the commission he had been charged with and only remembered it when on his way to the ante @-@ room .
'Oh , Kitty wished me to have a talk with you about Oblonsky , ' he said , when Lvov paused on the stairs as he was seeing his wife and Levin down .
'Yes , yes . Maman wishes us , les beaux frères , [ The brothers @-@ in @-@ law . ] to come down on him , ' said Lvov , blushing . But why should I ?
'Well then , I will be down on him ! ' said his wife smiling , as she stood in her white fur @-@ lined cloak waiting for them to finish their talk . ' Come , let us go ! '
AT THE MATINÉE CONCERT there were two very interesting items .
One was King Lear on the Heath , a fantasia , and the other was a quartet dedicated to the memory of Bach .
Both pieces were new and in the new style , and Levin was led to form an opinion on them .
He carefully avoided the musical experts and great talkers , and stood with lowered eyes gazing straight before him , listening .
But the longer he listened to the King Lear fantasia , the further he felt from the possibility of forming any definite opinion .
Even these fragments of musical expression , though some of them were good , were unpleasing because they were quite unexpected and unprepared for .
Mirth , sadness , despair , tenderness , triumph came forth without any cause , like the thoughts of a madman .
And , as in the mind of a madman , these emotions vanished just as unexpectedly .
Throughout the performance Levin felt like a deaf person watching a dance .
He was quite perplexed when the music stopped and felt very tired as a result of strained attention quite unrewarded .
From all sides came loud applause .
Wishing to clear up his own perplexity by hearing other people 's impressions , Levin went to look for the experts , and was pleased to find a celebrated one chatting with his own acquaintance , Pestsov .
'Wonderful ! ' Pestsov was saying in his deep bass .
'Why , what has Cordelia to do with it ? ' Levin asked timidly , having quite forgotten that the fantasia presented King Lear on the heath .
'Cordelia appears ... here ! ' said Pestsov , tapping with his fingers the glossy programme he was holding , and handing it to Levin .
'You can 't follow without it , ' said Pestsov turning to Levin , as the man he had been talking to had gone away and he had no one else to talk to .
During the interval Levin and Pestsov began a discussion on the merits and defects of the Wagnerian tendency in music .
'The sculptor 's shadows so little resembled shadows that they even clung to a ladder , ' said Levin .
He liked this phrase , but could not remember whether he had not used it before , and to Pestsov himself , and after saying it he grew embarrassed .
Pestsov argued that art was all one , and that it can only reach its highest manifestations by uniting all the different kinds of art .
On going out Levin met several other acquaintances with whom he talked about politics , music , and mutual friends ; among others he met Count Bol . He had quite forgotten his intended visit to him .
'Well then , go at once , ' said the Princess Lvova , to whom he mentioned the matter . ' Perhaps they won 't receive you , and then call for me at the meeting .
'PERHAPS THEY DON 'T RECEIVE TO @-@ DAY ? ' said Levin as he entered the hall of Countess Bol 's house .
'They do ; please walk in , ' said the hall @-@ porter , determinedly helping him off with his overcoat .
'What a nuisance ! ' thought Levin with a sigh , as he pulled off one glove and smoothed his hat . ' What is the good of my going in ? And what on earth am I to say to them ? '
As he entered the first drawing @-@ room he met in the doorway the Countess Bol , who with an anxious and stern expression was giving orders to a servant .
When she saw Levin she smiled and asked him into the next room , a smaller drawing @-@ room , whence came the sound of voices .
'How is your wife ?
Have you been to the concert ?
We could not go .
Mama had to attend the funeral . ' 
How sudden it was ! ' said Levin .
'But she always was delicate . ' 
'Were you at the opera last night ? '
'Yes , splendid , ' he replied , and as he was quite indifferent to what they might think of him , he repeated what they had heard hundreds of times about the peculiarities of that singer 's talent .
The Countess Bol pretended to be listening .
When he had said enough and paused , the Colonel , who till then had kept silent , began also to talk about the opera and about the lighting of the opera @-@ house .
Levin rose too , but saw by the Countess 's face that it was not yet time for him to leave .
They say it will be very interesting , ' began the Countess .
'No , but I promised my sister @-@ in @-@ law to call for her there , ' said Levin .
There was a pause , and the mother exchanged glances with her daughter .
'Well , I expect it 's time now , ' thought Levin , and rose .
The hall @-@ porter as he helped him on with his overcoat asked where he was staying , and at once entered his address in a large well @-@ bound book .
Levin was in time to hear a summary which everybody said was very interesting .
LEVIN ARRIVED AT THE CLUB IN GOOD TIME .
Members and visitors were driving up as he got there .
He had long not been there - not since the days when after leaving the university he had lived in Moscow and gone out into Society .
He remembered the club and the external details of its rooms , but had quite forgotten the impression it then made upon him .
This hall @-@ porter not only knew Levin but knew all his connections and relatives as well , and at once mentioned some of his intimate friends .
He passed among the tables , which were nearly all occupied , surveying the guests .
Here and there he came across all sorts of people he knew : old and young , some whom he only just knew and some with whom he was intimate .
There was not one angry or anxious face among them .
Sviyazhsky and Shcherbatsky , Nevedovsky and the old Prince , Vronsky and Koznyshev , all were there .
'Why are you so late ? ' asked the old Prince with a smile , holding out his hand over his shoulder . ' How is Kitty ? ' he added , smoothing the table @-@ napkin , which he had tucked in behind a button of his waistcoat .
'She 's all right : they are all three dining together . ' 
Go to that table , and be quick and secure a seat , ' said the old Prince , and turning away he carefully took a plate of fish soup that was handed to him .
'Levin ! Here ! ' shouted some one a little farther off , in a kindly voice .
He sat beside a young military man , and two chairs were tilted against their table .
Levin joined them with pleasure .
He always liked that good @-@ natured spendthrift Turovtsin ; with him was associated the memory of his proposal to Kitty ; but to @-@ day , after all those strained intellectual conversations , Turovtsin 's good @-@ natured face was particularly welcome .
'These are for you and Oblonsky .
Turovtsin introduced him .
'Oblonsky is always late . ' 
'Have you just come ? ' asked Oblonsky , hastening toward them . ' How do you do ?
Well then , come ! '
It might have been thought that from a score of different hors d 'oeuvres it would be possible to select one to any taste , but Oblonsky ordered something special , and one of the liveried footmen brought it at once .
They drank a glass of vodka each and returned to their table .
While they were still at their soup Gagin ordered a bottle of champagne and had four glasses filled .
Levin did not refuse the proffered wine , and ordered another bottle .
He was hungry , and ate and drank with great pleasure , and with still greater pleasure took part in the simple merry talk of his companions .
Gagin , lowering his voice , related a new Petersburg anecdote which , though it was indecent and stupid , was so funny that Levin burst into loud laughter and people turned to look at him .
'That 's in the style of the story , " That 's just what I can 't bear " ; do you know it ? ' asked Oblonsky . ' Oh , it 's delightful !
'With Peter Ilyich Vinovsky 's compliments , ' interrupted an old waiter , bringing two delicate glasses of still sparkling champagne on a tray , and addressing Oblonsky and Levin .
Oblonsky took a glass , and exchanging a look with a bald , red @-@ haired man with a moustache who sat at the other end of their table , smilingly nodded to him .
'Who is that ? ' inquired Levin .
'You once met him at my house , do you remember ?
Levin followed Oblonsky 's example and took the glass .
Oblonsky 's anecdote was very amusing too .
Then Levin told one , which also was appreciated .
Then they talked about horses , about that day 's races , and how gallantly Vronsky 's Atlasny had won the first prize .
'Ah , here they are ! ' said Oblonsky , just as they were finishing , leaning back in his chair and stretching out his hand to Vronsky , who was approaching with a tall Colonel of the Guards .
Gaily leaning his arm on Oblonsky 's shoulder , he whispered something to him , and with the same merry smile held out a hand to Levin .
'Very glad to meet you , ' he said . ' I looked for you that day at the elections , but was told you had already left . ' 
'Yes , I left that same day .
We were just speaking about your horse .
I congratulate you ! ' said Levin . ' That was quick running ! '
'No ; my father did , and I remember them and know something about them . ' 
'Where did you dine ? ' asked Oblonsky .
'At the second table , behind the pillars . ' 
'He has been congratulated ! ' remarked the Colonel . ' It 's the second time he 's won the Imperial prize . If only I had the luck at cards that he has with horses ! ...
But why waste the golden moments ?
I 'm off to the " infernal regions , " added he , and walked away .
'That 's Yashvin , ' said Vronsky in reply to Turovtsin 's question , as he took a vacant chair beside them .
Whether influenced by the club or by the wine he had drunk , Levin chatted with Vronsky about the best breeds of cattle , and was very pleased to find that he had not the least animosity toward the man .
He even told Vronsky among other things that he had heard from his wife that she had met him at the Princess Mary Borisovna 's .
'Oh , the Princess Mary Borisovna ! Isn 't she charming ? ' cried Oblonsky , and related an anecdote about her which made them all laugh .
Vronsky especially burst into such good @-@ natured laughter that Levin felt quite reconciled to him .
'Well , have you finished ? ' asked Oblonsky , rising and smiling . ' Let 's go ! '
ON LEAVING THE TABLE Levin , feeling that as he went his arms swung with unusual regularity and ease , passed with Gagin through the lofty apartments to the billiard @-@ room .
'Well , and how do you like our Temple of Idleness ? ' said the Prince , giving him his arm . ' Come , let 's walk about a little . ' 
'Yes , it interests you , but my interest is different to yours .
'You see , you don 't even know the word !
It is a club term .
And so it is with ourselves : we keep coming and coming to the club until we turn into shlyupiks . There !
What , the well @-@ known Prince Chechensky ?
He is always playing billiards , you know .
Three years ago he was not yet among the shlyupiks and he showed a bold front , calling others shlyupiks .
Well , one day he arrives , and our hall @-@ porter ...
Well , Prince Chechensky asks him : " I say , Vasily , who is here ?
Any of the shlyupiks ? "
There three gentlemen were arguing about the latest political news .
'Will you come , Prince ? Everything is ready , ' said one of his habitual partners , finding him there , and the Prince went away .
Levin sat down for a while and listened , but remembering all the conversations he had that day heard , he suddenly felt terribly bored .
He rose hastily and went to look for Oblonsky and Turovtsin , with whom he had felt merry .
Turovtsin , with a tankard of something to drink , was sitting on the high sofa in the billiard @-@ room , and Oblonsky was talking to Vronsky by the door in the far corner .
'She is not exactly dull , but that indefinite , unsettled position ... ' Levin overheard , and was hastening away when Oblonsky called him .
'Levin ! ' said he ; and Levin noticed that though in Oblonsky 's eyes there were not actually tears , they were moist , as they always were when he had been drinking or when he felt touched .
To @-@ day it was both . ' Levin , don 't go , ' he said , holding him tightly by the elbow , evidently not wishing to let him go on any account .
'Well , then there 's nothing for it but to kiss and be friends ! ' said Vronsky , good @-@ naturedly jesting and holding out his hand .
He quickly grasped Levin 's outstretched hand and pressed it .
'And I am glad too , ' said Vronsky .
But in spite of Oblonsky 's wish and theirs they had nothing to say to one another , and both knew it .
'You know , he is not acquainted with Anna , ' said Oblonsky to Vronsky . ' And I particularly wish to take him to see her .
'Really ? ' said Vronsky . ' She will be very glad .
I would go home at once , but I am anxious about Yashvin and want to stay here till he has finished . ' 
'He keeps on losing and I alone can restrain him . ' 
Levin , will you play ?
Oh , capital , ' said Oblonsky . ' Place the balls for pyramids , ' he added , turning to the billiard @-@ marker .
After the game Vronsky and Levin joined Gagin at his table , and at Oblonsky 's invitation Levin began betting on aces .
He was glad the hostility between Vronsky and himself was ended , and the impression of tranquillity , decorum , and pleasure did not leave him .
When they had finished their play Oblonsky took Levin 's arm .
'Well then , let us go to Anna 's .
I promised her long ago to bring you .
'Capital ! Let 's go ! ...
Find out whether my carriage has come , ' said Oblonsky to a footman .
'THE OBLONSKY CARRIAGE ! ' shouted the hall @-@ porter in a stern bass .
But Oblonsky would not let him reflect , and as if guessing his doubts tried to dispel them .
'How glad I am that you will make her acquaintance , ' said he .
'Do you know , Dolly has long wished it : and Lvov called on her and goes to see her .
Though she is my sister , ' Oblonsky continued , ' I may safely say that she is a remarkable woman .
Well , you 'll see !
'Why especially just now ? '
'We are negotiating with her husband about a divorce .
He agrees ; but there are difficulties about their son , and the affair , which should have been ended long ago , has already been dragging on for three months .
As soon as she gets the divorce she will marry Vronsky .
'What is the difficulty ? ' asked Levin .
'Oh , that is a long and tiresome story !
Everything is so indefinite in this country .
To the left , in the side street opposite the church ! ' shouted Oblonsky , leaning out of the carriage window .
'I think you see in every woman only a female , une couveuse ! [ A broody hen . ] necessarily occupied with children if at all ! ' said Oblonsky .
'No ! I believe Anna is bringing her up splendidly , but one does not hear about her .
Her occupations are , firstly , writing .
I can see you smiling sarcastically , but you are wrong !
She is writing a children 's book and does not speak of it to anyone , but she read it to me and I showed the manuscript to Vorkuyev ... You know , the publisher ... he writes himself , I think .
He is an expert , and says it is a remarkable work .
But you think she is a woman author ?
She is first of all a woman with a heart , you 'll see !
She now has a little English girl , and a whole family she is interested in . ' 
'Why , is it a philanthropic undertaking ? '
'There you are ! At once looking out for something bad !
They had - I mean , Vronsky had - an English trainer , a master in his own line , but a drunkard .
He took completely to drink , got delirium tremens , and has deserted his family .
But you 'll see her . ' 
Without asking the porter who opened the door whether Anna was in , Oblonsky entered the hall .
Levin followed , more and more in doubt as to whether he was acting well or badly .
Glancing in the mirror , Levin saw that he was red in the face , but he was sure he was not tipsy , and he followed Oblonsky up the carpeted stairs .
On the top landing a footman bowed to Oblonsky as to some one he knew well , and Oblonsky , asking who was with Anna Arkadyevna , received the answer that it was Mr. Vorkuyev .
Passing through a small dining @-@ room , panelled in dark wood , Oblonsky and Levin entered the study across the soft carpet . It was lit by a lamp with a large dark shade .
Another reflector @-@ lamp fixed to the wall illuminated a large full @-@ length portrait of a woman which attracted Levin 's involuntary attention .
It was Anna 's portrait painted in Italy by Mikhaylov .
He forgot where he was , and without listening to what was being said gazed fixedly at the wonderful portrait .
The only thing that showed she was not alive was that she was more beautiful than a living woman could be .
'I am so glad , ' he heard a voice saying near by , evidently addressing him , the voice of the very woman whom he had admired in the portrait .
In reality she was less brilliant , but there was something about her new and attractive which was not in the portrait .
SHE HAD RISEN TO GREET HIM , not concealing her pleasure at seeing him .
'How are you to @-@ day ? ' asked her brother .
Nerves as usual ! '
'Isn 't it wonderfully good ? ' said Oblonsky , noticing that Levin kept looking at the portrait .
'And it 's a wonderful likeness , isn 't it ? ' asked Vorkuyev .
A special brightness lit up Anna 's face when she felt his eyes on her .
Levin flushed , and to hide his confusion was about to ask her if it was long since she had seen Dolly , but at that instant Anna herself began to speak .
'We were just talking with Ivan Petrovich [ Vorkuyev . ] about Vashchenko 's last pictures .
Have you seen them ? '
'But excuse me , I interrupted you ? You were going to say ... '
'She was here yesterday . She is very angry with the High School because of Grisha .
The Latin master , it seems , has been unjust to him . ' 
Levin did not now speak at all in the matter @-@ of @-@ fact way in which he had talked that morning .
Every word of his conversation with her assumed a special importance .
It was pleasant to speak to her and yet more pleasant to listen to her ,
Anna not only talked naturally and cleverly , but cleverly and carelessly , not attributing any value to her own ideas , but attributing great value to those of her interlocutor .
Levin said the French had carried conventionality in art further than anyone else , and therefore attributed special merit to a return to realism .
In the fact that they had left off lying they perceived poetry .
Never had any clever thought uttered by Levin given him so much satisfaction as this .
Anna 's face brightened all over when she suddenly appreciated the remark .
'I am laughing as one laughs on seeing a very striking likeness !
What you have said quite characterizes present @-@ day French art , painting and even literature : Zola , Daudet .
'Yes ; that 's it exactly , ' said Vorkuyev .
'So you have been to the club ? ' she said , addressing her brother .
'What a woman ! ' thought Levin , and , quite forgetting himself , he gazed fixedly at her beautiful mobile face , which had now suddenly quite changed .
Levin did not hear what she was speaking about while she leaned toward her brother but was struck by the change in her expression .
After being so lovely in its tranquillity , her face suddenly expressed a strange curiosity , anger , and pride .
But this lasted only a moment .
She screwed up her eyes , as if she were remembering something .
'However , that won 't interest anyone , ' she said ; and turning to the little English girl , she added in English , ' Please order tea in the drawing @-@ room . ' 
The child rose and went out .
'Well , has she passed her examination ? ' inquired Oblonsky .
'You 'll finish by being fonder of her than of your own . ' 
There is no more or less in love .
I went several times .
They are very nice children , but I could not attach myself to the work .
You mention energy ...
And her smile and glance told him that she was speaking for him alone , valuing his opinion and knowing in advance that they would understand one another .
'Yes , I quite understand , ' Levin replied . ' It is impossible to put one 's heart into a school or an institution of that kind , and I think that is just why philanthropic establishments always give such poor results . ' 
After a pause she smiled and said , ' Yes , yes , I never could do it .
'How did you defend me ? '
'That varied with the attacks .
'Let me have it , Anna Arkadyevna , ' said Vorkuyev , pointing to the book . ' It is well worth it . ' 
'Oh no , it is so unfinished ! '
'I have told him about it , ' remarked Oblonsky to his sister , indicating Levin .
My writings are something like those little baskets and carvings made in prisons , which Lisa Merkalova used to sell to me .
And Levin perceived yet another feature in this woman whom he already liked so much .
In addition to her intelligence , grace , and beauty , she also possessed sincerity .
She did not wish to hide from him the hardships of her position .
When she had finished speaking she sighed , and all at once her face assumed a stern expression and became rigid .
Levin again looked at the portrait and at her figure as , arm @-@ in @-@ arm with her brother , she passed through the lofty doorway , and he felt a tenderness and pity for her which surprised him .
She asked Levin and Vorkuyev to pass on into the drawing @-@ room , and herself remained behind to speak to her brother . ' About the divorce ?
About me ? ' Levin wondered ; and he was so excited about what she might be saying to Oblonsky that he hardly listened to what Vorkuyev was telling him about the merits of Anna 's story for children .
Over their tea they continued the same kind of pleasant and interesting talk .
It seemed to Levin that all that was said , not only by her , but also by Vorkuyev and Oblonsky , assumed a special importance owing to her attention and remarks .
While following this interesting conversation Levin all the time continued to admire her : her beauty , her cleverness ; her good education , together with her simplicity and sincerity .
He listened and talked , and all the time thought of her , of her inner life , trying to guess her feelings .
And he , who had formerly judged her so severely , now by some strange process of reasoning justified her and at the same time pitied her and feared that Vronsky did not fully understand her .
Toward eleven , when Oblonsky rose to leave ( Vorkuyev had already gone ) , Levin felt as if he had only just arrived .
He got up regretfully .
'Good @-@ bye ! ' she said , retaining his hand and gazing at him with a look that drew him to her . ' I am very pleased que la glace est rompue . ' [ That the ice is broken . ]
'Tell your wife that I am just as fond of her as ever and that if she cannot forgive me my situation , I wish her never to forgive me .
To forgive , she would have to live through what I have lived through , and may God preserve her from that ! '
'Certainly , yes , I will tell her ... ' said Levin , blushing .
'WHAT A WONDERFUL , SWEET , PATHETIC WOMAN ! ' he thought as he and Oblonsky went out into the frosty air .
Didn 't I tell you ? ' said Oblonsky , who saw that Levin had been entirely vanquished .
'Yes , ' responded Levin pensively , ' an extraordinary woman !
Not on account of her intellect , but her wonderful sincerity ...
'God willing , everything will now soon be settled !
Well , another time , don 't judge in advance , ' said Oblonsky , opening the door of his carriage . ' Good @-@ bye !
At home he heard from Kuzma that Kitty was well and that her sisters had not long been gone , and he was given two letters .
These he read in the ante @-@ room , so as not to let them divert his attention later on .
The other letter was from his sister , who reproached him for not having settled her business yet .
'Well , we 'll sell it at five @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half , if they won 't give more . ' Levin promptly settled the first matter with great ease , though it had previously appeared to him so difficult .
'It 's surprising how all one 's time gets taken up here , ' he thought with reference to the second letter .
He felt himself to blame because he had not yet done what his sister asked of him .
'To @-@ day again I did not go to the Court , but to @-@ day I really had no time . ' 
And resolving that he would attend to it next day without fail , he went to his wife .
On his way he ran over in his mind the whole of the past day .
All the events had consisted of conversations : conversations to which he had listened or in which he had taken part .
All these conversations were about matters he would never have occupied himself with had he been in the country , but here they were very interesting .
All of them had been good , and only two things were not quite pleasant .
One was what he had said about the pike , and the other was that there was something not quite right about his tender pity for Anna .
Levin found his wife sad and depressed .
The three sisters ' dinner @-@ party would have gone off very well , except that he did not come in as they expected and they all became dull . Then the sisters left , and she remained alone .
'Well , and what have you been doing ? ' she asked , looking him in the eyes , which had a suspicious glitter in them .
But , not to hinder his relating everything , she masked her observation and listened with an appreciative smile while he told her how he had spent the evening .
'I was very pleased to meet Vronsky .
I felt quite at ease and quite natural with him .
But Kitty was not interested in the question of how the people drink ; she had seen his blush and wanted to know the reason .
'Well , and where did you go then ? '
On saying this Levin blushed still more , and his doubts as to whether he had done right or wrong in going to see Anna were finally solved .
He now knew that he should not have gone there .
Kitty 's eyes opened in a peculiar manner and flashed at the mention of Anna 's name , but making an effort she hid her agitation and so deceived him .
'Ah ! ' was all she said ..
'I am sure you won 't be angry with me for going .
'Oh no ! ' she said , but he saw by her eyes the effort she made to control herself , and it boded him no good .
'She is very charming , very , very much to be pitied , and a good woman , ' he said , telling her about Anna and her occupations and the message she had sent .
'Yes , of course she is much to be pitied , ' said Kitty when he had finished . ' From whom were your letters ? '
He told her , and misled by her quiet manner went to undress .
When he drew near she looked at him and burst into sobs .
'You have fallen in love with that horrid woman ! She has bewitched you !
I saw it in your eyes .
What can come of it ?
You were at the club drinking and drinking , and gambling , and then you went ... to whom ?
It was long before Levin could pacify his wife .
One thing that he sincerely confessed was that , living so long in Moscow with nothing but talk and food and drink , he was going silly .
They talked till three in the morning , and only then were they sufficiently reconciled to fall asleep .
WHEN HER VISITORS HAD TAKEN THEIR LEAVE Anna did not sit down , but began pacing up and down the room .
One thought , and one only , pursued her remorselessly in different forms .
Why has he been away all the evening ?
He sent word by Steve that he could not leave Yashvin , but must keep an eye on his play .
Is Yashvin such a child ?
He is glad of a chance to show me that he has other obligations .
I know he has , I agree to that .
But why prove it to me ?
He wishes to give me proofs that his love of me must not interfere with his freedom .
He ought to understand the hardship of my life here in Moscow .
I do not live , but only wait for a solution which is deferred and still deferred .
And Steve says he can 't go to see Alexis Alexandrovich ; and I can 't write again .
He ought to pity me , ' said she , feeling tears of self @-@ compassion rising to her eyes .
She heard Vronsky 's vehement ring at the front door and quickly dried her eyes . She even sat down near the lamp and opened a book , pretending to be tranquil .
She must let him see that she was displeased that he had not returned when he had promised - displeased , that should be all ; she would on no account show him her grief , and still less her self @-@ compassion .
She might pity herself , but he must not pity her .
She did not want strife and blamed him for wanting to fight , but yet she involuntarily took up a fighting attitude .
'Well , you 've not been dull ? ' he asked cheerfully and with animation , coming up to her . ' What a terrible passion gambling is ! '
'No , I have not been dull , I have long ago learnt not to feel dull .
'Yes , I knew they were coming to see you .
And how did you like Levin ? ' he asked , taking a seat beside her .
'Very much .
'He was lucky and won seventeen thousand .
I called him away and very nearly got him to come .
'Then what was the good of your staying with him ? ' she said , suddenly raising her eyes to his face .
Her look was cold and hostile . ' You told Steve you were staying to bring Yashvin away , but you have left him . ' 
A similar cold expression of readiness for strife appeared on his face .
She was pleased by this appeal to tenderness .
But some strange evil power prevented her from yielding to her impulse , as if the conditions of the struggle did not allow her to submit .
'Of course you wished to stay , and stayed .
You always do what you wish .
But why tell me ?
Why ? ' she said , becoming more and more agitated . ' Does anyone dispute your right ?
His hand closed , he leaned back , and his face assumed a still more stubborn look .
'But what is it all about ? ' he said , horrified at her expression of despair , and again leaning toward her he took her hand and kissed it . ' What have I done ?
'Well then , tell me what I should do to make you easy ?
'Nothing , nothing ! ' she replied . ' I don 't know myself whether it is this lonely life , or nerves ...
But don 't let 's talk about it !
What about the races ? You haven 't told me about them , ' and she tried to hide her triumph at her victory , for the victory was hers after all .
She felt that side by side with the love that united them there had grown up some evil spirit of strife , which she could not cast out of his heart and still less out of her own .
THERE ARE NO CONDITIONS OF LIFE to which a man cannot accustom himself , especially if he sees that every one around him lives in the same way .
But under the influence of weariness , a sleepless night , and the wine he had drunk , he slept soundly and peacefully .
He jumped up and looked round .
But on the other side of the partition a light was moving , and he heard her step .
'Nothing , ' said she , coming candle in hand from beyond the partition . ' I only felt a little unwell , ' she added with a peculiarly sweet and significant smile .
'What ? Has it begun ? Has it ? ' he asked in a frightened voice . ' We must send ... ' And he began to dress hurriedly .
'No , no , ' she said smiling , holding him back with her hand .
'I 'm sure it 's nothing .
She came back to her bed , put out the candle , lay down , and remained quiet .
At seven o 'clock he was awakened by her touch on his shoulder and a soft whisper .
She seemed to hesitate between regret at waking him and a desire to speak to him .
'Kostya , don 't be frightened .
We must send for Mary Vlasevna . ' 
The candle was burning again .
She was sitting on the bed holding in her hands some knitting she had lately been doing .
'Please don 't be frightened ! It 's nothing .
I 'm not a bit afraid , ' she said on seeing his alarmed face , and she pressed his hand to her breast and then to her lips .
It was necessary for him to go , but he could not tear himself away from the sight of her : He had loved that face and known all its expressions and looks , but he had never seen her as she was now .
How vile and despicable he appeared to himself before her as she now was , when he recollected the grief he had caused her yesterday !
Her flushed face surrounded with soft hair that had escaped from beneath her night @-@ cap shone with joy and resolution .
And in this simplicity , this nakedness of soul , she whom he loved was more apparent than ever .
She looked at him smilingly , but suddenly her eyebrows twitched , she raised her head , and coming quickly to him she took hold of his hand and clinging close she enveloped him in her hot breath .
She was suffering and seemed to be complaining to him of her pain .
And for a moment from force of habit he felt as if he were in fault .
But her look expressed a tenderness which told him that she not only did not blame him , but loved him because of those sufferings .
'If I am not to blame for it , who is ? ' he thought , involuntarily seeking a culprit to punish for these sufferings ; but there was no culprit .
She suffered , complained , triumphed in her sufferings , rejoiced in them and loved them .
He saw that something beautiful was taking place in her soul but what it was he could not understand .
It was above his comprehension .
'I have sent for Mama .
And you , go quickly and fetch Mary Vlasevna ...
'Well , go now . Pasha is coming .
And Levin saw with amazement that she again took up the knitting which she had fetched in the night , and recommenced work .
As Levin went out at one door he heard the maid enter at the other .
He stopped at the door and heard Kitty give detailed instructions to the maid , and with her help herself move the bed .
He dressed , and while the horse was being harnessed - for it was early , and no izvoshchiks were about yet - he ran back to the bedroom not on tiptoe but , as it seemed to him , on wings .
Two maids were busy moving something in the bedroom .
'I am going straight to the doctor 's .
They have already gone for Mary Vlasevna , but I will call there too .
'Yes , yes ! Go , ' she said rapidly , frowning and motioning him away with her hand .
He stopped and for a moment could not understand it .
'Yes , it was she , ' he said and , clasping his head with his hands , he ran downstairs .
'Lord have mercy ! Pardon and help us ! ' he repeated the words. that suddenly and unexpectedly sprang to his lips .
And he , an unbeliever , repeated those words not with his lips only .
At that instant he knew that neither his doubts nor the impossibility of believing with his reason - of which he was conscious - all prevented his appealing to God .
To whom should he appeal , if not to Him in whose hands he felt himself , his soul , and his love , to be ?
In the little sledge sat Mary Vlasevna in a velvet cloak with a shawl over her head .
'Thank God ! ' he muttered , recognizing with delight her little blonde face , which now wore a particularly serious and even severe expression .
Without stopping the izvoshchik he ran back beside her .
'So it began about two hours ago , not more ? ' she asked . ' You will find the doctor , but don 't hurry him .
'So you think it may go all right ?
God have mercy and help us ! ' said Levin as he saw his horse coming out of the gateway .
Jumping into the sledge beside Kuzma , he ordered him to drive to the doctor 's .
The man was cleaning lamp @-@ glasses and seemed quite absorbed in his task .
'Do not hurry and do not omit anything , ' he said to himself , conscious of an increasing uplift of his physical powers and of his attention to all that lay before him .
This was more than Levin could stand ; he resolutely snatched the bottle out of the man 's hands and rushed out at the big glass door .
The doctor was not up yet , and the footman , now busy putting down a carpet , refused to wake him .
Levin could hear the doctor at the other side of the door coughing , walking about , washing , and speaking .
Some three minutes elapsed ; to Levin they seemed more than an hour .
He could not wait any longer .
'Peter Dmitrich ! Peter Dmitrich ! ' he called out in a tone of entreaty through the open door .
'For heaven 's sake forgive me ! ...
'Immediately ! Immediately ! ' answered a voice , and Levin was astounded to detect that the doctor was smiling as he said it .
'Immediately ! '
Two minutes more passed while the doctor put on his boots and two more while he put on his clothes and brushed his hair .
'Peter Dmitrich ! ' Levin again began in a piteous voice , but at that instant the doctor came out , dressed and with his hair brushed .
'These people have no conscience , ' thought Levin . ' Brushing their hair while we are perishing . ' 
'Good morning ! ' said the doctor , holding out his hand and , as it seemed to Levin , teasing him by his calm manner . ' Don 't hurry !
Trying to be as exact as possible , Levin began recounting every unnecessary detail of his wife 's position , continually interrupting himself to beg the doctor to accompany him at once .
'Don 't be in such a hurry .
You see you are inexperienced , I am sure I shall not be needed , but I promised , and if you like I will come .
Please sit down . Won 't you have a cup of coffee ? '
Levin gave the doctor a look which asked whether he was not laughing at him .
But the doctor had no idea of laughing .
'I know , I know , ' he said with a smile . ' I am a family man myself .
'But what is your opinion , Peter Dmitrich ?
Do you think it may go all right ? '
'All the symptoms are favourable . ' 
'Then you will come at once ? ' said Levin , looking angrily at the servant who brought in the coffee .
'Well , the Turks are being seriously beaten !
Did you read yesterday 's telegram ? ' asked the doctor , chewing a piece of roll .
'No , I can 't stand it ! ' said Levin , jumping up . ' So you will come in a quarter of an hour ? '
'On your honour ? '
Levin got home just as the Princess arrived , and they met at the bedroom door .
There were tears in the Princess 's eyes and her hands shook .
'Well , Mary Vlasevna , darling ? ' she asked , seizing the hand of the midwife who came toward them with a beaming but preoccupied expression .
And only one hour had passed !
But the minutes went by , and the hours , and other hours , and his suffering and terror and strain grew tenser .
The ordinary conditions of life , without which nothing can be imagined , no longer existed for Levin .
He was surprised when Mary Vlasevna asked him to light a candle behind the partition , and he learnt that it was already five o 'clock in the evening .
Had he been told it was ten in the morning he would not have been more astonished .
He had just as little idea of where he was at that time as he had of when it all took place .
He saw her burning face , now bewildered and full of suffering , and now smiling and soothing him .
But he did not know how they came and went , nor where they were .
He did it with zeal , believing that it was necessary for her sake , and only later discovered that he had been preparing a sleeping @-@ place for himself .
Then he was sent to the study to ask the doctor about something .
But where , when , and why all this was done he did not know .
He only knew and felt that what was happening was similar to what had happened the year before in the hotel of the provincial town on the deathbed of his brother Nicholas .
Only that was sorrow and this was joy .
But that sorrow and this joy were equally beyond the usual conditions of life : they were like openings in that usual life through which something higher became visible .
During the whole of that time he was alternately in two different moods .
But when , looking at her , he again saw that to help was impossible ; he was seized with horror and said , ' Lord , pardon and help us ! '
He would jump up , wishing to run away somewhere , but ran to her instead .
Sometimes when she had called him again and again , he was half @-@ inclined to blame her .
But seeing her meek smiling face and hearing her say , ' I have worn you out , ' he blamed God ; but the thought of God made him at once pray for forgiveness and mercy .
Dolly had just entered the study and suggested that the doctor should lie down .
It was an interval of rest and oblivion .
He had quite forgotten what was going on .
The scream was so terrible that Levin did not even jump up , but looked breathlessly with a frightened and inquiring glance at the doctor , who bent his head on one side to listen and smiled approvingly .
Everything was so out of the ordinary that nothing any longer surprised Levin .
'Probably it had to be so , ' thought he and remained sitting still .
'But who was it screaming ? '
He jumped up and rushed into the bedroom on tiptoe , past Mary Vlasevna and the Princess , and stopped at his place at the head of the bed .
Kitty 's burning face , worn with suffering , with a lock of hair clinging to her clammy forehead , was turned toward him trying to catch his eye .
Her raised hands asked for his .
Seizing his cold hands in her perspiring ones she pressed them to her face .
I am not afraid , I am not afraid ! ' she said rapidly . ' Mama !
You are not afraid ?
She spoke very rapidly and tried to smile , but all at once her face became distorted and she pushed him away .
'No , this is awful !
Go ! Go ! ' she cried , and again he heard that scream unlike any other cry .
'It 's all right , it 's all right ! All goes well ! ' Dolly called after him .
But say what they might , he knew that now all was lost .
Leaning his head against the door @-@ post he stood in the next room , and heard some one shrieking and moaning in a way he had never heard till then , and he knew that these sounds were produced by what once was Kitty .
He had long ceased wishing for a child , and now he hated that child .
He did not now even wish her to live , but only longed that these terrible sufferings should end .
'Doctor , what is it ?
What is it ?
'It 's coming to an end , ' said the doctor , with a face so serious that Levin thought that end meant death .
Quite beside himself , he rushed into her room .
The first thing he saw was Mary Vlasevna 's face .
It was still more frowning and stern .
Kitty 's face did not exist .
In its place was something terrible , both because of its strained expression and because of the sounds which proceeded from it .
He let his head drop upon the wood of the bedstead , feeling that his heart was breaking .
The terrible screaming did not cease , but grew yet more awful until , as if it had reached the utmost limit of horror , it suddenly ceased .
With her arms helplessly outstretched upon the quilt , unusually beautiful and calm she lay , gazing silently at him , trying unsuccessfully to smile .
The taut strings snapped , and sobs and tears of joy that he had not in the least anticipated arose within him , with such force that they shook his whole body and long prevented his speaking .
Falling on his knees by her bedside he held his wife 's hand to his lips , kissing it , and that hand , by a feeble movement of the fingers , replied to the kisses .
And a boy !
Don 't be anxious , ' Levin heard Mary Vlasevna say , as she slapped the baby 's back with a shaking hand .
The Princess could only sob in reply .
And amid the silence , as a positive answer to the mother 's question , a voice quite unlike all the restrained voices that had been speaking in the room made itself heard .
Kitty was alive , her sufferings were over ; and he was full of unspeakable bliss .
This he comprehended , and it rendered him entirely happy .
But the child ?
Who was he ? ... He could not at all accustom himself to the idea .
It seemed something superfluous , something overflowing , and for a long time he was unable to get used to it .
TOWARD TEN O 'CLOCK the old Prince , Koznyshev , and Oblonsky were with Levin , and having talked about the young mother they had begun discussing other matters .
Levin listened to them and at the same time involuntarily thought of the past and of what had been going on before that morning , remembering himself as he had been yesterday before this event .
A hundred years seemed to have elapsed since then .
He felt as if he were on some unattainable height , from which he painstakingly descended in order not to hurt the feelings of those with whom he was conversing .
He talked but never ceased thinking of his wife , of the details of her present condition , and of his son - to the idea of whose existence he painstakingly tried to accustom himself .
That feminine world which since his marriage had received a new and unsuspected significance for him now rose so high in his estimation that his imagination could not grasp it .
He heard a conversation about yesterday 's dinner at the club and thought , ' What is happening to her now ? Is she asleep ?
How is she ?
Is our son , Dmitry , crying ? '
'Send and let me know whether I may see her , ' said the old Prince .
'All right , directly ! ' answered Levin , and , without pausing , went to her room .
She was not asleep , but was talking quietly with her mother , making plans for the christening .
Made neat , her hair brushed , a smart cap trimmed with something blue on her head , she lay on her back with her arms outside the quilt , and met his look with a look which drew him toward her .
Again an agitation , similar to that which he had felt at the moment of the birth , gripped his heart .
He could not answer and , conscious of his weakness , turned away .
'And I have been dozing , Kostya ! ' she said . ' And now I feel so comfortable . ' 
She was gazing at him , but suddenly her face changed .
'Let me have him , ' said she , hearing the baby 's cry . ' Let me have him , Mary Vlasevna , and he will see him too ! '
Levin , gazing at this tiny piteous being , vainly searched his soul for some indications of paternal feeling .
He felt nothing for it but repulsion .
Mary Vlasevna laughed .
When the baby had been swaddled and made into a firm doll , Mary Vlasevna turned it over as if proud of her work , and stepped aside that Levin might see his son in all his beauty .
Kitty turned her eyes and gazed fixedly in the same direction . ' Let me have him , let me have him ! ' she said , and was even going to raise herself .
'What are you doing , Catherine Alexandrovna ? You must not move like that !
Let 's show Papa what a fine fellow we are ! '
And Mary Vlasevna held out to Levin on one hand ( the other merely supporting the nape of the shaky head ) this strange , limp , red creature , that hid its head in its swaddling clothes .
But there was also a nose , blinking eyes , and smacking lips .
'A beautiful baby ! ' said Mary Vlasevna .
Levin sighed bitterly .
This beautiful baby only inspired him with a sense of repulsion and pity .
These were not at all the feelings he had expected .
He turned away while Mary Vlasevna laid the child to the unaccustomed breast .
'Well , that 's enough ! That 's enough ! ' said Mary Vlasevna ; but Kitty would not part with the baby .
'Now look at him , ' said Kitty , turning him so that Levin could see him .
The old @-@ looking little face wrinkled up still more and the baby sneezed .
Smiling , and hardly able to keep back tears of tenderness , Levin kissed his wife and quitted the darkened room .
What he felt toward this little creature was not at all what he had anticipated .
There was nothing merry or joyful in it ; on the contrary , there was a new and distressing sense of fear .
It was the consciousness of another vulnerable region .
OBLONSKY 'S AFFAIRS WERE IN A BAD STATE .
Two @-@ thirds of the money for the forest had already been spent , and by allowing a discount of ten per cent he had obtained from the merchant almost the whole of the last third .
The position had certainly been a very good one a few years ago , but it was so no longer .
Sventitsky , Director of a Company , got Rs.17 , ooo ; and Mitin , having founded a bank , got Rs.5o , ooo .
Like all such posts it required such immense knowledge and activity as could hardly be united in one man .
And as there was no one found who united those qualities , it was at any rate better for the post to be filled by an honest rather than a dishonest man .
Oblonsky moved in those Moscow circles where that word was used , and was there considered an honest man , so that he had a better claim to the post than other people .
The post carried a salary of from seven to ten thousand roubles a year , and Oblonsky could hold it without resigning his official position .
It depended on two Ministers , one lady , and two Jews ; and though they had already been prepared it was necessary for Oblonsky to see all these people in Petersburg .
Moreover , he had promised his sister Anna to obtain a decisive answer about the divorce from Karenin .
So , having got fifty roubles from Dolly , he went to Petersburg .
Sitting in Karenin 's study and listening to his article on ' The Causes of the Bad State of Russian Finance , ' Oblonsky only waited for him to conclude to speak about his own affairs and about Anna .
'Yes , but I bring forward another principle which embraces the principle of freedom , ' said Karenin , accentuating the word ' embraces , ' and putting his pince @-@ nez on again to re @-@ read the part where this was said .
Turning over the beautifully written , very broad @-@ margined manuscript , Karenin re @-@ read the convincing passage :
Karenin was silent , thoughtfully turning over the leaves of his manuscript .
The name of the post that was so near his heart was already familiar to Oblonsky and he pronounced it rapidly without any blunder .
Karenin inquired what was the work of this new Committee , and pondered .
He was considering whether in the activity of this Committee there was not something at variance with his own projects .
But as the work of the new institution was very complicated and his project covered a very extensive domain , he could not decide this immediately , and taking off his pince @-@ nez said :
'Certainly I could speak to him ; but , really , why do you want the post ? '
'I consider , and I have written an article on the point , that the enormous salaries paid nowadays are a symptom of the false economic position of our administration . ' 
'Yes , but what would you have ? ' said Oblonsky . ' Let 's say a bank director gets ten thousand , - he 's worth it , you know !
Or an engineer gets twenty thousand .
'I consider that a salary is payment for value received and should be subject to the law of supply and demand .
This is an abuse important in itself , which has a bad effect on the State service .
I consider ... '
'Yes , ' said he , ' but you will agree that a new and unquestionably useful institution is being started .
Anyway , it is a live business !
It is particularly desired that the work should be managed honestly , ' concluded Oblonsky , with an emphasis on the word .
But the Moscow meaning of ' honest ' was unintelligible to Karenin .
'Honesty is only a negative quality , ' said he .
'But you would greatly oblige me , all the same , if you would put in a word - when you happen to see Pomorsky , ' said Oblonsky
'But it depends chiefly on Bolgarinov , I think , ' said Karenin .
'Bolgarinov quite agrees , as far as he is concerned , ' returned Oblonsky with a blush .
He blushed at the mention of Bolgarinov , because he had that morning been to see the Jew and the visit had left an unpleasant impression on his mind .
And when Bolgarinov at length received him with extreme politeness , evidently triumphing in his humiliation , and very nearly refused his request , Oblonsky hastened to forget it as quickly as he could ; and only now on recollecting it blushed .
'NOW THERE 'S ANOTHER MATTER ; you know what it is ... about Anna , ' said Oblonsky after a short pause , when he had shaken off the unpleasant recollection .
Directly Oblonsky mentioned Anna 's name Karenin 's face entirely changed . Instead of its former animation it expressed weariness and lifelessness ..
'What is it you wish of me ? ' Karenin said , turning round in his chair and folding his pince @-@ nez .
'A decision , some decision , Alexis Alexandrovich !
You should have pity on her . ' 
'What do you mean exactly ? ' asked Karenin in a low tone .
'Why , pity her !
If you had seen her as I have who have spent the whole winter with her , you would pity her .
'It seems to me , ' returned Karenin in a more high @-@ pitched , almost squeaky voice , ' that Anna Arkadyevna has everything she herself desired . ' 
'Oh , Alexis Alexandrovich ! For God 's sake don 't let us have any recriminations !
What is past is past ! You know what she wants and is waiting for : the divorce . ' 
'But I understood that Anna Arkadyevna declined a divorce if I insisted on keeping my son .
I answered in that sense and thought the matter was closed .
I consider it closed , ' shrieked Karenin .
'For heaven 's sake don 't excite yourself , ' said Oblonsky , touching his brother @-@ in @-@ law 's knee . ' The matter is not closed .
If you will let me recapitulate , this is how matters stood : When you parted , you were great , as magnanimous as a man can possibly be ; you consented to everything : her freedom and even a divorce .
She appreciated it to such a degree that , at the moment , feeling herself to blame toward you , she did not consider and could not consider everything .
She renounced everything .
But facts and time have shown that her situation is tormenting and impossible . ' 
'Anna Arkadyevna 's life cannot interest me , ' interposed Karenin , lifting his brows .
'Allow me not to believe that , ' Oblonsky rejoined gently . ' Her situation is tormenting to her and does not benefit anyone .
But I , and all her relatives , who all love her , beg and implore you !
Who gains by it ? '
'Excuse me ! You seem to be placing me in the position of defendant , ' Karenin remonstrated .
I would arrange everything for you so that you would not be bothered .
'The promise was given before , and I thought the question about my son had settled the matter ...
Besides , I hoped that Anna Arkadyevna would have generosity enough ... ' uttered Karenin with difficulty , his lips trembling and his face turning pale .
'She leaves everything to your generosity !
She asks , she pleads for one thing only : help her out of the intolerable position she is in !
She no longer asks for her son ...
Alexis Alexandrovich ! You are a good man .
If you had not promised before , she would have grown reconciled to her position and have gone on living in the country .
And now in Moscow where every time she meets anyone it is like a knife in her heart , she has been living for six months every day expecting your decision .
Why , it 's like keeping a man condemned to death with the halter round his neck for months , promising him either death or a reprieve !
Have pity on her , and I undertake to arrange ...
'I am not speaking of that ... of that ... ' Karenin interrupted him in a disgusted tone . ' But perhaps I promised something I had no right to promise . ' 
'Then you refuse what you promised ? '
'I have never refused to do what is possible , but I want time to consider in how far what was promised is possible . ' 
'No , Alexis Alexandrovich ! ' said Oblonsky , jumping to his feet . ' I will not believe that !
She is as wretched as a woman can be , and you cannot refuse such a ... '
Vous professez d 'être un libre penseur , [ You profess to be a freethinker . ] but I , as a believer , in so important a matter cannot act contrary to the Christian law . ' 
'But in Christian communities , and in ours too as far as I know , divorce is permitted , ' said Oblonsky . ' Divorce is also permitted by our Church .
And we see ... '
'It is permitted , but not in that sense . ' 
'Alexis Alexandrovich , I don 't recognize you ! ' said Oblonsky after a pause . ' Was it not you ( and did we not appreciate it ? ) who forgave everything , and , moved just by Christian feeling , were ready to sacrifice everything ?
You yourself said " Give your coat when they would take your cloak ... " ! And now ... '
'I beg , ' began Karenin in a shrill voice , suddenly rising to his feet , pale and with trembling jaw , ' I beg you to stop ... stop ... this conversation ! '
Well then , forgive me ! forgive me if I have pained you , ' said Oblonsky with an embarrassed smile , holding out his hand . ' I only delivered my message as an envoy . ' 
Karenin gave him his hand , reflected , and then said :
'I must think it over and seek for guidance .
The day after to @-@ morrow I will give you a final answer , ' he added , after consideration .
OBLONSKY WAS JUST LEAVING when Korney entered and announced :
'Who is Sergey Alexeyich ? ' Oblonsky was about to ask , but immediately recollected .
He recalled the timid pathetic look with which Anna at parting from him had said : ' Anyhow , you will see him .
Find out everything : where he is , who is with him .
And , Steve ... if it is possible ...
He had understood what ' If it is possible ' meant . It meant , if it is possible to arrange the divorce so that she should have her son ...
But now Oblonsky saw that it was useless even to think of that ; he was , however , glad to see his nephew .
Karenin reminded his brother @-@ in @-@ law that they never mentioned his mother to the boy , and asked him not to say a word about her .
'He was very ill after that unexpected interview with his mother , ' remarked Karenin . ' We even feared for his life .
But sensible treatment and sea @-@ bathing in the summer have restored his health , and now , on the doctor 's advice , I send him to school .
The influence of his schoolfellows has really had a good effect on him , and he is quite well and learns well . ' 
'Hullo ! What a fine fellow !
True enough , it 's not little Serezha now , but a complete Sergey Alexeyich ! ' said Oblonsky , smiling as he looked at a handsome boy in a blue jacket and long trousers who entered the room boldly and confidently .
The lad looked healthy and bright .
He bowed to his uncle as to a stranger , but recognizing him he blushed and turned away from him quickly as if offended and angry about something .
The boy came up to his father and handed him his school report .
'Well , that 's pretty good , ' said his father . ' You may go now . ' 
'He has grown thin and tall , and is no longer a child but a regular boy , ' said Oblonsky . ' I like it . Do you remember me ? '
The boy glanced swiftly at his father .
'I do , mon oncle , ' he answered , looking at his uncle and then again lowering his eyes .
'Well , how are things ? ' said he , wishing to start a conversation , but not knowing what to say .
The boy , blushing and not answering , gently withdrew his hand from his uncle 's grasp .
As soon as Oblonsky released it , after a questioning glance at his father , he hastily left the room like a bird let out of its cage .
A year had passed since Serezha last saw his mother .
Since then he had not heard any more of her .
During this year he had been sent to school , and had learned to know his schoolmates and to like them .
The dreams and memories of his mother which , after their interview , had made him ill , no longer occupied him .
When they rose in his memory he took pains to drive them away , considering them shameful and fit only for girls , but not for a boy and a chum .
He knew that his father and mother had had a quarrel which separated them ; knew that it was his fate to remain with his father , and he tried to accustom himself to that thought .
He felt uncomfortable at meeting his uncle , who resembled his mother , because it awakened those very memories which he considered shameful .
'We play at railways now , ' he said , answering the question . ' You see , it 's this way : two sit down on a form ; they are passengers .
The doors are opened beforehand ...
It 's not easy to be the guard ! '
'That 's the one who stands up ? ' asked Oblonsky with a smile .
'Yes . It needs courage and quickness , especially if they stop suddenly , or if somebody falls down . ' 
'Yes , that 's no joke , ' said Oblonsky , looking sadly into those animated eyes so like the mother 's - an infant 's eyes no longer , and no longer altogether innocent .
And , in spite of his promise to Karenin , he could not refrain from speaking of Anna .
'Do you remember your mother ? ' he suddenly asked .
'No , I don 't ! ' hurriedly replied Serezha , and blushing scarlet he hung down his head .
His uncle could get nothing more out of him .
'I expect you hurt yourself when you fell down ? ' said the tutor . ' I told you it was a dangerous game .
'If I had hurt myself no one would have known it , that is quite certain ! '
'Leave me alone !
Why should I remember ?
Leave me alone ! ' he said , now addressing not his tutor but the world in general .
AS WAS HIS WONT , Oblonsky did not spend his time idly while in Petersburg .
Besides business - his sister 's divorce and his post - it was as usual necessary for him , as he said , to refresh himself in Petersburg after the mustiness of Moscow .
Moscow , despite its cafés chantants and its omnibuses , was still a stagnant pool .
Oblonsky always felt this .
After living in Moscow , especially in the bosom of his family , Oblonsky always felt his spirits flag .
Only that day he had been talking to Prince Chechensky .
He had a wife and family with grown @-@ up sons who were pages at Court ; and another family , an illegitimate one , in which there were other children .
Though the first family was all right , Prince Chechensky felt happier with the second family .
He took his eldest son to visit the second family , and told Oblonsky that he considered it developed his son and was good for him .
What would they say to that in Moscow ?
In Petersburg children did not hinder their fathers living .
Children were brought up in educational establishments , and there were none of those barbaric views that were becoming so prevalent in Moscow - Lvov 's was a case in point - that the children should have every luxury and the parents nothing but work and worry .
Here people understood that a man must live his own life like a civilized being .
Service too was not here that strained , hopeless drudgery that it was in Moscow ; here there was an interest in the Service .
But it was the Petersburg outlook on money matters that had a particularly soothing effect on Oblonsky .
Bartnyansky , who spent at least fifty thousand roubles a year at the rate he was living , had the day before made a notable remark to him on the point .
As they were having a chat before dinner , Oblonsky had said to Bartnyansky :
'You are , I think , intimate with Mordvinsky ? You could do me a good turn if you would put in a word for me .
There is a post I should like to get ...
'Never mind the name , I shouldn 't remember it ! ... But why do you want to mix in those railway concerns , with Jews ? ...
Look at it how you like , it 's horrid ! '
Oblonsky did not tell him that it was a ' live ' business . Bartnyansky would not have understood that .
Is it much ? ' asked Bartnyansky sympathetically .
'Very much : about twenty thousand roubles . ' 
Bartnyansky burst into merry laughter .
'Oh , you lucky fellow ! ' he cried . ' My debts amount to a million and a half , and I have nothing ! But , as you see , I still find it possible to live ! '
Oblonsky knew this to be true , not only from hearsay but from actual fact .
Zhivakhov , whose debts amounted to three hundred thousand roubles , didn 't possess a penny and yet he lived , and how he lived !
Petrovsky had run through five millions , continued living in just the same style , and even directed the Finance Department and received a salary of twenty thousand .
But , apart from that , Petersburg acted pleasantly on Oblonsky physically .
In Moscow he sometimes noticed some grey hairs ; fell asleep after dinner ; stretched himself ; walked slowly upstairs , breathing heavily ; felt dull among young women , and did not dance at balls .
In Petersburg he always felt that he had shaken off ten years .
In Petersburg he felt what the sixty @-@ year @-@ old Prince Peter Oblonsky , who had just returned from abroad , had described to him only the day before .
I see a young woman , and my fancy ...
Stephen experienced just the same difference as Peter Oblonsky .
Between the Princess Betsy Tverskaya and Oblonsky there existed long @-@ established and very peculiar relations .
Oblonsky in fun always paid court to her , and told her the most indecent things also in fun , knowing that she liked that more than anything .
This tone had sprung up between them because he was very attractive to her .
'Ah , so you are here ! ' she said on seeing him . ' Well , how is your poor sister ?
Don 't look at me like that , ' she added . ' Since every one has been attacking her - all those who are a hundred thousand times worse than she - I have thought she has acted splendidly .
I can 't forgive Vronsky for not letting me know when she was in Petersburg .
I would have gone to her and with her everywhere .
Please give her my love ...
'Yes , her situation is a hard one ... ' Oblonsky began , in the simplicity of his heart taking the Princess Myagkaya 's words for genuine coin when she said ' Tell me about her . ' 
But the Princess Myagkaya immediately interrupted him , as was her habit , and commenced telling her own tale .
'She has done what everybody , except myself , does secretly , and she would not deceive , and has acted splendidly .
Excuse me .
Now that he has got so chummy with Lydia Ivanovna and Landau , every one says he is half @-@ witted ; and I should be glad not to agree with everybody , but this time I can 't help it . ' 
'But do explain to me what it means ! ' said Oblonsky .
'Yesterday I called on him about my sister 's affair and asked him for a definite answer .
'Ah , that 's it , that 's it ! ' Princess Myagkaya began joyfully . ' They will ask Landau and see what he says . ' 
Landau , you see , was a commis [ Shop @-@ assistant . ] in Paris and went to see a doctor .
He fell asleep in the doctor 's waiting @-@ room , and while asleep began giving advice to all the patients , and very strange advice too .
Afterwards , Yury Meledinsky 's wife ( the invalid 's wife , you know ) heard of that Landau , and took him to see her husband .
No good has been done in my opinion , for he is still just as weak , but they believe in him and take him about with them .
So they brought him to Russia .
Here every one rushed at him , and he began treating everybody .
'Adopted ! How ? '
'Simply adopted him !
He is now no longer Landau , but Count Bezzubov .
AFTER AN EXCELLENT DINNER and a large quantity of brandy at Bartnyansky 's , Oblonsky , only a little after the appointed time , entered the Countess Lydia Ivanovna 's house .
'Who is with the Countess ?
'Alexis Alexandrovich Karenin and Count Bezzubov , ' the hall @-@ porter replied severely .
It was still quite light out of doors , but in the Countess Lydia Ivanovna 's small drawing @-@ room the blinds were down and the lamp alight .
At the round table beneath a lamp sat the Countess and Karenin , conversing in low tones .
After greeting the hostess and Karenin , Oblonsky involuntarily glanced at the stranger once more .
'Monsieur Landau ! ' The Countess addressed him with a softness and caution that struck Oblonsky .
Landau hurriedly looked round , approached smilingly , laid upon Oblonsky 's outstretched hand his own moist and motionless one , went back , and continued looking at the portraits .
The Countess and Karenin glanced at each other significantly .
'I am very pleased to see you , especially to @-@ day , ' said the Countess Lydia Ivanovna , pointing to a seat beside Karenin .
'I introduced him to you as Landau , ' she said softly , glancing at the Frenchman and then back at Oblonsky , ' but really he is Count Bezzubov , as you probably know .
But he does not like that title . ' 
'Yes , I have heard , ' replied Oblonsky . ' They say he has completely cured the Countess Bezzubov . ' 
'She called on me to @-@ day , and was so pathetic , ' said the Countess , turning to Karenin . ' This separation is dreadful for her .
It is such a blow to her ! '
'Is he going definitely ? ' inquired Karenin .
He heard a voice yesterday , ' said the Countess , with a look at Oblonsky .
'Ah , a voice ! ' Oblonsky remarked , feeling that he must be as careful as possible in this company , where something peculiar occurred , or was supposed to occur , to which he as yet lacked a clue .
After a momentary pause the Countess Lydia Ivanovna , as if coming to the important point , turned with a subtle smile to Oblonsky .
'I have known you a long time , and am very pleased to know you more intimately .
[ The friends of our friends are our friends . ] But to be a friend , one must enter into the state of the friend 's soul , and I fear you will not do so in relation to Alexis Alexandrovich .
You understand what I am speaking about ? ' she said , lifting her beautiful dreamy eyes .
'To some extent , Countess ! I understand that Alexis Alexandrovich 's position ... ' said Oblonsky , not quite grasping what it was all about , and therefore wishing to keep to generalities .
'Well , broadly speaking , I can picture to myself the change .
'The change that has taken place in him cannot weaken his love for his neighbour ; on the contrary , that change must strengthen his love .
Won 't you have some tea ? ' she said , indicating with her eyes the footman who was handing tea round on a tray .
Of course his misfortune ... '
'Yes , a misfortune which has turned into a great blessing , because his heart became new and is filled with Him , ' she said , glancing at Oblonsky with lovesick eyes .
'I think I might ask her to mention me to both , ' thought he .
'Oh , certainly , Countess ! ' he said . ' But I think such changes are so very intimate that nobody , not even the closest friend , cares to speak about them . ' 
We must speak , and so help one another . ' 
'Yes , of course , but there are such differences of conviction , and besides ... ' said Oblonsky with a gentle smile .
'There cannot be any differences in what concerns the holy Truth ! '
'Oh no , of course not ! But ... ' and , becoming embarrassed , Oblonsky stopped short .
'It seems to me he will fall asleep directly , ' said Karenin in a significant whisper , approaching Lydia Ivanovna .
Oblonsky turned .
Noticing the looks directed toward him , he smiled a childishly naive smile .
'Take no notice of him , ' said Lydia Ivanovna , and with an agile movement she pushed forward a chair for Karenin . ' I have noticed ... ' she began , when a footman entered with a note .
Lydia Ivanovna rapidly read the note and , excusing herself , with extreme rapidity wrote and despatched the answer and returned to the table . ' I have noticed , ' she continued her interrupted sentence , ' that Muscovites , men especially , are most indifferent to religion . ' 
'Oh no , Countess ! I think Muscovites have the reputation of being the most steadfast believers , ' replied Oblonsky .
'But , as far as I know , you unfortunately are one of the indifferent ? ' Karenin remarked to him , with a weary smile .
'How can one be indifferent ? ' said Lydia Ivanovna .
'I am in this respect not precisely indifferent , but rather expectant , ' said Oblonsky with his most mollifying smile . ' I do not think that for me the time for those questions has yet come . ' 
Karenin and Lydia Ivanovna exchanged looks .
'No , not yet , I think , ' said Lydia Ivanovna , who was watching the Frenchman 's movements .
Landau rose and came up to them .
'You will allow me to listen ? ' he asked .
'Oh yes ! I did not wish to disturb you , ' said Lydia , looking tenderly at him . ' Sit down beside us . ' 
'Only one must not shut one 's eyes , so as to deprive oneself of light , ' Karenin continued .
'Oh , if you only knew the happiness we experience , feeling His continual presence in our souls ! ' cried the Countess Lydia Ivanovna with a beatific smile .
'You mean to say , he is prevented by sin ? ' said Lydia Ivanovna . ' But that is a false view .
Excuse me ! ' she added , glancing at the footman who entered with another note .
'Yes , but faith without works is dead , ' said Oblonsky , recalling that sentence from the catechism , and only by a smile maintaining his independence .
'How much harm has been done by a false interpretation of that passage !
Nothing turns so many from the faith as that interpretation , " I have no works , and therefore cannot have faith . "
'To labour for God with works ; to save one 's soul by fasting , ' said the Countess Lydia Ivanovna with fastidious disdain , ' those are the barbarous opinions of our monks ...
It is much simpler and easier , ' she added , looking at Oblonsky with the same encouraging smile with which at Court she encouraged young Maids of Honour who were confused by their new surroundings .
'We are saved by Christ , who suffered for us .
We are saved by faith , ' Karenin chimed in , showing his approval of her remark by a look .
And having found the book and sat down again , she opened it . ' It is quite short .
It describes the way to acquire faith and the joy , higher than anything else on earth , with which it fills the soul .
A believer cannot be unhappy because he is not alone .
But you will see ... ' she was about to begin reading when the footman came in again . ' Borozdina ?
You know Mary Sanina ?
She lost her only child .
Well , and what happened ? She found this Friend , and now she thanks God for her child 's death .
That is the happiness faith gives ! '
'Oh yes , it is very ... ' began Oblonsky , glad that she was going to read and give him time to get his ideas together .
'No , evidently it will be better not to ask for anything to @-@ night , ' he reflected ; ' only let me get away from here without making a mess of things ! '
'It will be dull for you , ' said the Countess Lydia Ivanovna , turning to Landau , ' as you don 't understand English ; but it is quite short . ' 
'Oh , I shall understand , ' replied Landau with the same smile , and closed his eyes .
Karenin and Lydia Ivanovna exchanged significant looks , and the reading began .
OBLONSKY FELT COMPLETELY PUZZLED by the strange and novel language he was listening to .
Listening to the Countess Lydia Ivanovna and feeling the fine eyes , naive or roguish - he did not know which - of Landau fixed upon him , Oblonsky began to be conscious of a peculiar sort of heaviness in his head .
The most varied ideas were mixed up in his mind .
'Mary Sanina is glad that her child is dead ...
To be saved one need only have faith ; the monks don 't know how to do it , but the Countess Lydia Ivanovna knows ...
And what is so heavy in my head ?
Is it the brandy , or is it because all this is so very strange ?
All the same , I think I have not done anything to shock them up till now .
But still , it won 't do to ask her help now .
I have heard that they make one pray .
That would be too stupid !
Why is he Bezzubov ? '
Suddenly Oblonsky felt his nether jaw dropping irresistibly for a yawn .
He smoothed his whiskers to hide the yawn , and gave himself a shake .
But then he felt himself falling asleep , and nearly snored .
He roused himself , just when the Countess Lydia Ivanovna uttered the words : ' He is asleep . ' 
Oblonsky awoke in a fright , feeling guilty and detected .
But he was immediately comforted by noticing that the words ' He is asleep ' did not apply to him but to Landau .
But whereas Oblonsky 's sleep would , he imagined , have offended them - he did not really even think this , for everything seemed so strange - Landau 's sleep delighted them extremely , especially Lydia Ivanovna .
The Frenchman slept or pretended to sleep , leaning his head against the back of the chair , and his moist hand lying on his knee moved feebly , as if catching something .
Karenin rose , and though he tried to be cautious he caught against the table . He went up to the Frenchman and placed his hand in his .
Oblonsky also rose and , opening his eyes wide to wake himself up in case he was asleep , looked first at one and then at the other .
It was all quite real , and Oblonsky felt his head getting worse and worse .
'Qu 'elle sorte ! ' repeated the Frenchman impatiently .
When he returned to Peter Oblonsky 's house , where he was staying , he found a note from Betsy .
She wrote that she greatly wished to finish the conversation they had begun , and asked him to call next day .
Scarcely had he finished reading the note and made a wry face over it , when he heard downstairs the heavy steps of men carrying something heavy .
It was Peter Oblonsky , grown young again .
Oblonsky was in low spirits , a thing that rarely happened to him , and could not fall asleep for a long time .
Everything he recalled was nauseous , but most repulsive of all , like something shameful , was the memory of the evening at Lydia Ivanovna 's .
Next day he received from Karenin a definite refusal to divorce Anna , and understood that this decision was based on what the Frenchman had said the evening before , in his real or pretended sleep .
BEFORE ANY DEFINITE STEP CAN BE TAKEN in a household , there must be either complete division or loving accord between husband and wife .
When their relations are indefinite it is impossible for them to make any move .
Many families continue for years in their old ruts , hated by both husband and wife , merely because there is neither complete discord nor harmony .
The irritation which divided them had no tangible cause , and all attempts at an explanation not only failed to clear it away but increased it .
Neither of them spoke of the cause of their irritation , but each thought the other in the wrong , and at every opportunity tried to prove that this was so .
She was jealous , not of any one woman , but of the diminution of his love .
At the slightest hint she transferred her jealousy from one object to another .
And being jealous , Anna was indignant with him and constantly sought reasons to justify her indignation .
She blamed him for everything that was hard in her situation .
The torture of expectation , living betwixt heaven and earth , which she endured there in Moscow , Karenin 's dilatoriness and indecision , her loneliness - she attributed all to him .
If he loved her he would fully understand the difficulty of her situation , and would deliver her from it .
That they were living in Moscow , instead of in the country , was also his fault .
He could not live buried in the country as she desired .
He needed society , and so he had placed her in this terrible position , the misery of which he would not understand .
And it was likewise his fault that she was for ever parted from her son .
Even the rare moments of tenderness which occurred between them did not pacify her ; in his tenderness she now saw a tinge of calm assurance which had not been there before and irritated her .
It was growing dusk .
Passing ever backwards from the memorably offensive words of the quarrel to their cause , she at last got back to the beginning of their conversation .
For a long time she could not believe that the dispute had begun from a perfectly inoffensive conversation about a matter that did not touch the heart of either .
Yet it was so .
It had all begun by his laughing at High Schools for girls , which he considered unnecessary and she defended .
He spoke disrespectfully of the education of women in general , and said that Hannah , her little English protegée , did not at all need to know physics .
She saw in it a contemptuous allusion to her own knowledge ; and she invented and uttered a phrase in retaliation which should revenge the pain he had caused her .
'I don 't expect you to understand me and my feelings , as an affectionate man would ; but I did expect ordinary delicacy , ' she said .
And he really had flushed with vexation and had said something disagreeable .
She did not remember her reply to it , but remembered that in answer he had said with obvious intent to hurt her too :
'I can take no interest in your partiality for that little girl , because I can see that it is unnatural . ' 
'I am very sorry that only what is coarse and material is comprehensible and natural to you , ' she retorted and left the room .
When he came to her in the evening they did not refer to the quarrel , but both felt that it was only smoothed over , not settled .
'I am to blame ; I am irritable and unreasonably jealous .
I will make it up with him and we will go back to the country . There I shall be calmer . ' 
'Unnatural ! ' She suddenly remembered the word that had hurt her most , though it was not so much the word as his intention to pain her .
'I know what he wanted to say : he wanted to say that it is unnatural not to love one 's own daughter and yet to love another 's child .
What does he know of love for children , - of my love for Serezha whom I have given up for his sake ?
And that desire to hurt me !
No , he must be in love with some other woman ; it can 't be anything else . ' 
Then , realizing that in her attempt to quiet herself she had again completed the circle she had already gone round so often , and had returned to her former cause of irritation , she was horror @-@ struck at herself .
Is it possible that I can 't take it on myself ? ' she wondered , and began again from the beginning . ' He is truthful , he is honest .
He loves me . I love him .
Yes , now , as soon as he comes back , I will tell him I was to blame , though in fact I was not , and we will go away ! '
And not to continue thinking , and not to yield to irritation , she rang and ordered her trunks to be brought , to pack their things for the country .
'WELL , HAVE YOU HAD A GOOD TIME ? ' she asked , coming out to meet him with a meek and repentant look on her face .
'Just as usual , ' he answered , perceiving at a glance that she was in one of her pleasant moods .
He was already accustomed to these transitions , and to @-@ day was specially glad , because he himself was in the best of spirits .
Ah , that 's right ! ' he said , pointing to the trunks in the ante @-@ room .
'Yes we must go away .
'It is my only wish .
Order tea . ' 
And he went to his room .
When he returned she told him , partly repeating words she had prepared , how she had spent the day and her plans for the move to the country .
'Do you know , it came to me almost like an inspiration ? ' said she . ' Why must we wait here for the divorce ?
I can 't wait any longer .
I don 't want to hope , I don 't want to hear anything about the divorce .
I have made up my mind that it shall not influence my life any more .
'Oh yes ! ' he answered , looking uneasily at her excited face .
'Well , and what have you been doing ? Who was there ? ' she asked after a pause .
Vronsky named the guests . ' The dinner was capital , the boat @-@ races and everything quite nice , but in Moscow they can 't get on without doing something ridiculous ...
Some sort of a lady turned up - the Queen of Sweden 's swimming instructress - and displayed her art . ' 
'What ? She swam ? ' asked Anna , with a frown .
'Yes , in some sort of red costume de natation [ Swimming costume . ] - a hideous old creature !
And did she swim in some particular way ? ' asked Anna , without answering his question .
'Nothing particular at all .
I said it was awfully absurd ...
Well , when do you think of going ? '
Anna shook her head , as though driving away an unpleasant thought .
'When are we going ?
Why , the sooner the better .
Wait a bit ! The day after to @-@ morrow is Sunday , and I must go and see maman , ' said Vronsky , and became confused , because as soon as he had mentioned his mother he felt an intent and suspicious gaze fixed upon him .
His embarrassment confirmed her suspicions .
She flushed and moved away from him .
It was no longer the Queen of Sweden 's instructress but the Princess Sorokina who lived in the country near Moscow with the Countess Vronskaya who presented herself to Anna 's imagination .
'You could go there to @-@ morrow ! ' she said .
'If that 's so , then we won 't go at all ! '
'Why 's that ? ' said Vronsky , as if in surprise . ' There 's no sense in that . ' 
'You see no sense in it because you don 't care at all about me .
The one person I was interested in here was Hannah - you say that is all pretence !
You said yesterday that I don 't love my daughter but pretend to love that English girl , and that it is unnatural ! I should like to know what sort of life can be natural for me here ! '
For a moment she recollected herself and was horrified at having broken her resolution .
Yet though she knew she was ruining her cause , she could not restrain herself , could not forbear pointing out to him how wrong he was , and could not submit to him .
'I never said that ; I only said that I do not sympathize with that sudden affection . ' 
'Why do you , who boast of your truthfulness , not speak the truth ? '
'I never boast and never tell untruths , ' he said softly , restraining his rising anger . ' It is a great pity if you don 't respect ... '
'Respect was invented to fill the empty place where love ought to be !
But if you no longer love me , it would be better and more honourable to say so ! '
'What do you mean by that ? ' she cried , glancing with terror at the definite expression of hatred on his whole face , and especially in the cruel , menacing eyes .
'I mean to say ... ' he began , but stopped . ' I must ask what you want of me ! '
'What can I want ?
I can only want you not to abandon me , as you are thinking of doing , ' she said , having understood all that he had left unsaid . ' But I don 't want that , that is secondary .
What I want is love , and it is lacking .
Therefore all is finished ! '
'Stop !
St @-@ o @-@ op ! ' said Vronsky , his brow still knit , but holding her back by the hand . ' What is the matter ?
I said we must put off our departure for three days , and you replied that I lie and am not an honourable man . ' 
'Yes ! And I repeat that a man who reproaches me because he has given up everything for my sake , ' said she , recalling the words of a still earlier quarrel , ' is worse than a dishonourable man ! He is a heartless man ! '
'No ! There are limits to one 's endurance , ' he exclaimed , and quickly let go her hand .
'He hates me , that is clear , ' thought she , and silently , without looking round and with faltering steps , she left the room .
'He loves another woman , that is clearer still , ' she said to herself as she entered her own room . ' I want love , and it is lacking .
So everything is finished ! ' she repeated her own words , ' and it must be finished . ' 
In her soul there was another vague idea , which alone interested her , but of which she could not get hold .
Again remembering Karenin , she also remembered her illness after her confinement , and the feeling that never left her at that time .
She remembered. her words , ' Why did I not die ? ' and her feelings then .
And suddenly she understood what was in her soul .
Yes , that was the thought which would solve everything .
Alexis Alexandrovich 's shame and disgrace , and Serezha 's , and my own terrible shame - all will be saved by my death .
If I die he too will repent , will pity me , will love me and will suffer on my account ! '
With a fixed smile of self @-@ pity on her lips she sat in the chair , taking off and putting on the rings on her left hand , and vividly picturing to herself from various points of view his feelings after she was dead .
Sounds of approaching steps , his steps , distracted her thoughts .
Pretending to be putting away her rings , she did not even turn round .
He came up to her , and taking her hand said softly :
'What is it ? ' he asked .
'You know yourself ? ' said she , and at the same moment , unable to restrain herself any longer , she burst into tears .
'Abandon me ! Abandon me ! ' she murmured between her sobs .
I don 't wish to torment you , I don 't !
I will set you free .
Vronsky implored her to be calm , and assured her that there was not an atom of foundation for her jealousy , that he never had ceased , and never would cease , to love her , that he loved her more than ever .
'Anna , why torture yourself and me like this ? ' he said , kissing her hands .
His face now wore a tender expression , and she thought she detected in his voice the sound of tears , and their moisture on her hand .
And instantly her despairing jealousy changed into desperate , passionate tenderness . She embraced him , and covered his head , his neck , and his hands with kisses .
FEELING THAT THEY WERE ENTIRELY RECONCILED , next morning Anna began actively to make preparations for their move .
She stood in her room before an open trunk , sorting clothes , when he came in earlier than usual and ready dressed .
'I will go to maman at once . She can send me the money through Egorov and I shall be ready to go to @-@ morrow , ' said he .
Good as the mood she was in might be , the reference to the move to the country pricked her .
Vronsky was eating his beefsteak when she entered the dining @-@ room .
'You would hardly believe how disgusting these rooms have become to me ! ' she said , sitting down to her coffee beside him . ' There is nothing worse than these furnished apartments !
They are expressionless and soulless .
I think of Vozdvizhensk as of a Promised Land .
Are you driving out anywhere ? '
'I wanted to go to the Wilsons , to take her a dress .
Vronsky 's valet came in to fetch a receipt for a telegram from Petersburg .
There was nothing odd in his receiving a telegram , but , as if wishing to hide something from her , he told the man that the receipt was in his study and hastily turned to her , saying :
'From whom was the telegram ? ' she asked , not listening to him .
'From Steve , ' he replied reluctantly .
'Why didn 't you show it me ?
What secret can Steve have from me ? '
'I did not wish to show it you , because Steve has a passion for telegraphing . What is the use of telegraphing when nothing has been settled ? '
'Yes , but he wires : " Could get no answer .
Promises a decisive answer soon . "
Anna took the telegram with trembling hands and saw exactly what Vronsky had said , but at the end were added the words : ' Little hope , but I 'll do everything possible and impossible . ' 
'I said yesterday that it is all the same to me when I get the divorce , or even whether I get it at all , ' she said , flushing . ' There was no need at all to conceal it from me . ' 
And she thought : ' In the same way he may hide and is hiding from me his correspondence with women . ' 
'Oh , Yashvin wanted to come this morning with Voytov , ' said Vronsky . ' It seems he has won from Pevtsov all and even more than Pevtsov can pay - about sixty thousand roubles . ' 
I said that I don 't want to think about it , and I wish that you were as little interested in it as I am . ' 
'It interests me because I like definiteness , ' he replied .
'Definiteness depends not on forms , but on love , ' she said , growing more and more irritated not at his words but at the tone of cool tranquillity with which he spoke . ' Why do you want it ? '
'Oh God ! Again about love ! ' he thought with a wry face .
'Don 't you know why ? For your own sake and for that of the children we may have ! ' said he .
'That 's a great pity , ' he said .
'You want it for the children , but you don 't think of me , ' she pursued , quite forgetting or not hearing that he said : ' for your own sake and for the children . ' 
The possibility of having children had long been a subject of dispute , and it irritated her .
She explained his desire to have children as showing that he did not value her beauty .
'Oh , I said for your sake !
Most of all for your sake , ' he repeated , his face contorted as with pain , ' because I am convinced that a great deal of your irritability is due to our indefinite position . ' 
'That is not the reason , ' she said , ' and I can 't even understand how what you call my " irritability " can be caused by that ; I am entirely in your power .
What indefiniteness of position is there ?
'I am very sorry you don 't wish to understand me , ' he interrupted , stubbornly intent on expressing his thought . ' The indefiniteness consists in your imagining that I am free . ' 
'You may be perfectly at rest on that matter ! ' she rejoined , and turning away she began to drink her coffee .
After a few sips she glanced at him , and from the expression of his face clearly realized that her hand , her movement , and the sound made by her lips were repulsive to him .
'It is perfectly indifferent to me what your mother thinks and whom she wishes to marry you to , ' she went on , putting down her cup with a trembling hand .
'But we are not talking about that . ' 
'Yes , about that very thing !
And believe me , a heartless woman , be she old or young , your mother or a stranger , does not interest me , and I don 't want to have anything to do with her . ' 
'Anna , I beg you not to speak disrespectfully of my mother . ' 
'A woman whose heart has not divined wherein her son 's happiness and honour lies has no heart ! '
'I repeat my request that you should not speak disrespectfully of my mother , whom I respect ! ' said he , raising his voice and looking sternly at her .
Looking intently at his face and hands , she remembered their reconciliation the day before and his passionate caresses in all their details .
'Just such caresses he has lavished , and wants to lavish , on other women , ' she thought .
'You don 't love your mother !
It 's all words , words , words ! ' she said , looking at him with hatred .
'Decide ... and I have decided , ' she said and was about to go away , but just then Yashvin entered . Anna said ' Good morning , ' and stopped .
'Oh , I don 't know . I don 't think I shall get it all , and on Wednesday I must go .
And you ? ' asked Yashvin , looking at Vronsky with half @-@ closed eyes and evidently divining that there had been a quarrel .
'Yes , but now it 's decided , ' said Anna , looking straight into Vronsky 's eyes with an expression that told him he must not think of the possibility of a reconciliation .
'Is it possible you are not sorry for that unfortunate Pevtsov ? ' she said , continuing her conversation with Yashvin .
You see , my whole fortune is here , ' and he pointed to a side pocket , ' and now I am a rich man ; but I shall go to the club to @-@ night and shall perhaps leave it a beggar .
So we struggle , and therein lies the pleasure ! '
'But supposing you were married ? How would your wife feel about it ? ' asked Anna .
'I expect that 's why I never married , and never meant to . ' 
'How about Helsingfors ? ' said Vronsky , joining in the conversation , and he glanced at Anna who had smiled .
Meeting his look , her face suddenly assumed a coldly severe expression , as if to say : ' It is not forgotten .
'Is it possible you were ever in love ? ' she asked Yashvin .
'Oh heavens ! How many times !
But , you see , some men find it possible to sit down to cards and yet to be able always to leave when the time comes for an assignation !
Now I can engage in love @-@ making , but always so as not to be late for cards in the evening .
'No , I am not asking about that , but about the real thing . ' She was going to say Helsingfors , but did not want to repeat the word Vronsky had used .
Before leaving the house Vronsky came to her room .
She wished to pretend to be looking for something on the table , but feeling ashamed of the pretence , looked straight into his face with a cold expression .
'Gambetta 's certificate ; I have sold him , ' he replied in a tone which said more clearly than words : ' I have no time for explanations , and they would lead to nothing . ' 
'I am not at all in the wrong toward her , ' he thought . ' If she wants to punish herself , tant pis pour elle ! '
[ So much the worse for her . ] But , as he was going out , he thought she said something , and suddenly his heart ached with pity for her .
'If it 's nothing , then tant pis ! ' he thought , again chilled . Turning away , he went out .
As he was going out he caught sight in a looking @-@ glass of her pale face and trembling lips .
He even wished to stop and say a comforting word to her , but his legs carried him out of the room before he had thought of anything to say .
All that day he spent away from home , and when he returned late at night the maid told him that Anna Arkadyevna had a headache and asked him not to go to her room .
This was the first time it had been so , and this was not even a quarrel .
It was an evident acknowledgment of complete estrangement .
How could he look at her as he had looked when he came into the room for the certificate ?
Look at her , see that her heart was torn by despair , and go out in silence with that calmly indifferent look ?
Not only had he cooled toward her , but he hated her because he loved another woman - that was clear .
And recalling all the cruel words he had uttered , Anna invented other words which he evidently had wished to say and could have said to her , and she grew more and more exasperated .
'I do not hold you , ' he might have said . ' You may go where you please .
You probably did not wish to be divorced from your husband so that you could go back to him .
If you need money , I will give you some .
How many roubles do you want ? '
All the cruellest words that a coarse man could say he , in her imagination , said to her , and she did not forgive him for them any more than if he had really said them .
'And was it not last night that he , an honourable and truthful man , swore he loved me ?
Have I not often before despaired needlessly ? ' she said to herself immediately after .
If not , it means that all is over , and then I will decide what I am to do ... !
At night she heard his carriage stop , heard him ring , heard his steps , and his voice talking to the maid . He believed what he was told , did not want to learn more and went to his room !
So all was over !
Now it was all the same whether they went to Vozdvizhensk or not , whether she got a divorce or not - it was all useless .
All she wanted was to punish him .
'How could I say those cruel words to her ? ' he would say . ' How could I leave the room without saying anything ?
But now she is no more !
'Death ! ' she thought .
And such terror came upon her that it was long before she could realize where she was and with trembling hand could find the matches to light another candle in the place of the one that had burnt down and gone out .
'No - anything , only to live !
Why , I love him !
And he loves me ; All this has been , but will pass , ' she said , feeling that tears of joy at this return to life were running down her cheeks .
And , to escape from her fears , she hastily went to him in his study .
She came up , and holding the light above him looked at him long .
Without waking him she returned to her room , and after a second dose of opium toward morning she fell into a heavy but troubled sleep , without ever ceasing to be conscious of herself .
In the morning a terrible nightmare , which had come to her several times even before her union with Vronsky , repeated itself and woke her .
And she awoke in a cold perspiration .
When she got up , the previous day appeared in her memory as in a fog .
There had been a quarrel .
It was what had happened several times before .
'I said I had a headache , and he did not come to see me .
To @-@ morrow we shall leave . I must see him and get ready for the move , ' she thought .
After some talking in the hall , some one came upstairs and she heard Vronsky 's step outside the drawing @-@ room .
He was going quickly downstairs .
There he was on the steps , without a hat , going down to the carriage .
The young girl in the lilac hat handed him a parcel .
Vronsky said something to her and smiled .
Yesterday 's feelings wrung her aching heart with fresh pain .
She could not now understand how she could have humiliated herself so as to remain a whole day with him in his house .
She went to his study to announce to him her decision .
'It was the Princess Sorokina with her daughter who came to bring me the money and documents from maman .
I could not get them yesterday .
How is your head - better ? ' he said quietly , not wishing to see or understand the gloomy and solemn look on her face .
She stood silent in the middle of the room , looking at him intently .
He glanced at her , frowned for an instant , and continued to read a letter .
She turned , and slowly moved from the room .
He could still call her back , but she reached the door and he remained silent , and only the rustle of the paper as he turned a page was heard .
'Oh , by the way - ' he said when she was already in the doorway - ' we are definitely going to @-@ morrow , aren 't we ? '
'You , but not I , ' she said , turning round toward him .
'This is becoming intolerable ! '
'You ... you will repent of this ! ' she said , and left him .
Alarmed by the despairing look with which she had said these words , he jumped up , intending to run after her , but , recollecting himself , he sat down again , tightly clenching his teeth and frowning .
'I have tried everything , ' he thought , ' the only thing left is to pay no attention , ' and he began getting ready to drive to town , and to go again to his mother 's to obtain her signature to a power of attorney .
She heard the sound of his steps in the study and dining @-@ room .
But he did not return to her ; he only gave an order that they should let Voytov have the horse in his absence .
Then she heard the carriage drive up and the door open , and he went out again .
But now he re @-@ entered the hall , and some one ran upstairs .
She went back to the window and saw him take the gloves without looking , and , having touched the coachman 's back with his hand , say something to him .
Then , without turning to look up at the window , he sat down in the carriage in his usual posture , crossing one leg over the other , and , putting on a glove , disappeared round the comer .
IS IT FINISHED ? ' said Anna to herself as she stood by the window ; and in answer to that question , the impressions left by the darkness when her candle went out and by the terrible dream , merging into one , filled her heart with icy horror .
'No , it is impossible ! ' she exclaimed and , crossing the room , she rang loudly .
She was so terrified at being alone that she did not wait for the servant but went out to meet him .
The man replied that the Count had gone to the stables .
'Very well .
Send Michael with it to the stables at once .
Come home . We must talk it over .
For God 's sake come ; I am frightened . ' 
Then , afraid to remain alone now , she followed him out of the room and went to the nursery .
'How is this ? That 's not it - this is not he !
The little girl , sitting at the table , persistently and firmly hammered on it with the stopper of a bottle , gazing blankly at her mother with her two black @-@ currants of eyes .
But the child 's loud ringing laughter and a movement of her eyebrows reminded Anna so vividly of Vronsky , that , repressing her sobs , she rose hurriedly and left the room .
No , it cannot be , ' she thought . ' He will come back .
But how will he explain to me that smile , and his animation after he had spoken to her ?
If I don 't believe him , there is only one way left for me ... and I don 't want that . ' 
Twelve minutes had passed .
'Now he has received my note and is on his way back .
No , that 's impossible !
He must not find me with red eyes .
Oh ! And did I brush my hair or not ? ' she asked herself ; but could not remember .
'Yes , my hair was done , but I don 't in the least remember when . ' 
She did not even trust her hand , and went up to the mirror to see whether her hair really was done or not .
It was , but she could not remember doing it .
'Yes that is I ! ' she suddenly realized , and looking at her whole figure she suddenly felt his kisses , shuddered , and moved her shoulders .
'What is it ? Am I going mad ? ' and she went to her bedroom , where Annushka was tidying up .
'Annushka ! ' she said , stopping before the maid and looking at her , without knowing what she would say to her .
'You wished to go to see the Princess Oblonskaya , ' said the maid , apparently understanding her .
'But how could he go away leaving me in this condition ?
Just as she was going to compare her watch with the large clock some one drove up .
But no one came upstairs and she heard voices below .
Her messenger had returned in the carriage .
'Oh , of course ! He did not receive it , ' she remembered .
'Go with this note to the Countess Vronskaya 's country house ; do you know it ?
'But what shall I do myself ? ' she thought . ' Yes I will go to Dolly 's , of course , or else I shall go out of my mind !
And I can telegraph as well ! '
'I must speak to you , come at once . ' 
Ready dressed and with her bonnet on , she again looked at Annushka 's placid and now still rounder face .
Evident compassion showed plainly in those kindly little grey eyes .
'Annushka , my dear ! What am I to do ? ' muttered Anna sobbing , as she sank helplessly into an arm @-@ chair .
'Why take it so to heart , Anna Arkadyevna ?
Such things will happen .
'Yes , I will go , ' said Anna , recovering and rousing herself ; ' and if a telegram comes during my absence , send it to Darya Alexandrovna 's ...
'Where to , ma 'am ? ' asked Peter , before getting onto the box .
THE WEATHER WAS BRIGHT .
All the morning there had been fine drizzling rain , but it had now just cleared up .
It was three o 'clock ; the busiest time in the streets .
Now the idea of death no longer seemed so terrible and clear , and death itself no longer seemed inevitable .
She reproached herself now with the humiliation to which she had descended .
'I entreated him to forgive me .
I have surrendered to him .
Can I not live without him ? '
Dental surgeon ... "
She is not fond of Vronsky .
It will be humiliating and painful , but I will tell her everything .
She is fond of me and I will follow her advice .
I won 't submit to him ; I won 't let him educate me ...
The Moscow water is so good .
And she remembered how , long , long ago , when she was only seventeen , she visited the Troitsa Monastery with her aunt .
How many things that then seemed to me excellent and unattainable have since become insignificant , and things that then existed are now for ever unattainable !
Should I then have believed that I should descend to such humiliation ?
How proud and satisfied he will be to get my note !
How nasty that paint smells !
Why are they always painting and building ?
" Dressmaking and Millinery , " - ' she read .
A man bowed to her .
It was Annushka 's husband .
'Our parasite , ' she remembered how Vronsky had said the words . ' Our ?
We cannot tear it out but we can hide the memory of it .
And I will hide it ! '
At this point she recollected her past with Karenin and how she had effaced the memory of him .
'Dolly will think I am leaving a second husband and that I am therefore certainly unjustifiable .
Do I want to be justified ?
I can 't ! ' she said to herself , and wished to cry .
But she immediately began to wonder what those two young girls could be smiling at .
The boulevard and children .
Three boys running about playing at horses .
And I shall lose everything and shan 't get him back .
Yes , I shall lose everything if he does not return .
'Is anyone here ? ' she asked in the ante @-@ room .
That same Kitty with whom Vronsky was in love , ' thought Anna . ' She whom he remembered affectionately .
And of me he thinks with hate and regrets having joined himself to me ! '
When Anna arrived the two sisters were consulting about feeding the baby .
Dolly went out alone to meet the visitor who at that moment had come to interrupt their talk .
'So you have not left yet ?
I was myself coming to see you , ' said Dolly . ' I had a letter from Steve to @-@ day . ' 
'We also had a telegram from him , ' replied Anna , looking round for Kitty .
'He writes that he cannot understand what Alexis Alexandrovich really wants , but that he won 't leave without getting an answer . ' 
'Yes , Kitty , ' answered Dolly with embarrassment . ' She is in the nursery .
'I heard about it .
'I will fetch it at once .
But he has not refused ; on the contrary , Steve is hopeful , ' added Dolly , pausing at the door .
'I have no hope , and don 't even desire it , ' said Anna .
'What does it mean ? Kitty considers it humiliating to meet me ! ' thought Anna when she was left alone .
I know that no respectable woman can receive me in my position .
I knew that from the first moment I sacrificed everything for him .
It is still worse for me ; it is harder than ever ! ' She heard the voices of the sisters conferring together in the next room .
It is no use appealing to her .
But it would be interesting to see Kitty and show her how I despise everybody and everything : how indifferent everything is to me . ' 
'I knew it all , ' she said , ' and it does not interest me in the least . ' 
I , on the contrary , am hopeful , ' said Dolly , looking at Anna with curiosity .
She had never seen her in such a strange and irritable mood . ' When are you leaving ? ' she asked .
Anna , screwing up her eyes , gazed straight before her without answering .
'Is Kitty hiding from me then ? ' she asked , looking toward the door and blushing .
'Oh , what nonsense !
She is nursing her baby and has difficulty with it , and I was advising her ...
She is very pleased .
She will come directly , ' Dolly said awkwardly , not knowing how to tell an untruth . ' Oh , here she is ! '
When she heard that Anna had come Kitty did not wish to appear ; but Dolly persuaded her .
Having mustered up her courage , Kitty came in and , blushing , went up to Anna and held out her hand .
'I am very pleased - ' she began in a trembling voice .
'I should not have been surprised if you had not wanted to see me .
I have got used to everything .
You have been ill ?
Yes , you are changed ! ' said Anna .
She attributed that animosity to the awkward position Anna , who had formerly patronized her , now felt herself to be in , and she was sorry for her .
They talked about Kitty 's illness , about the baby , and about Steve ; but evidently nothing interested Anna .
'I came to say good @-@ bye to you , ' she said , rising .
But Anna again , without replying , turned to Kitty .
'Yes , I am very glad to have seen you , ' she said with a smile . ' I have heard so much about you from everybody , and even from your husband .
He called on me and I liked him very much , ' she added , with obvious ill intent . ' Where is he ? '
'He has gone to the country , ' answered Kitty , blushing .
'Remember me to him ; be sure you do ! '
'I will be sure to , ' repeated Kitty naively , looking compassionately into her eyes .
'Well then , good @-@ bye , Dolly ! ' And kissing Dolly and pressing Kitty 's hand , Anna hurried away .
'She is still the same and as attractive as ever .
Charming ! ' said Kitty when she was once more alone with her sister . ' But there is something pathetic about her , terribly pathetic ! '
'Yes , but to @-@ day there is something peculiar about her , ' said Dolly . ' When I was seeing her out , there in the ante @-@ room , I thought she was going to cry . ' 
ANNA RESEATED HERSELF IN THE CALÈCHE in a state of mind even worse than when she left home .
To her former torments was now added a feeling of being affronted and repudiated , of which she had been clearly sensible during the meeting with Kitty .
Home ? ' asked Peter .
'Yes , home , ' she said , now not even thinking of where she was going .
'How they looked at me , as at something dreadful , incomprehensible , and strange ! ...
What can he be telling that other man so warmly ? ' she thought , glancing at two pedestrians . ' How is it possible to tell another what one feels ?
I meant to tell Dolly , but it 's a good thing I didn 't .
She would have concealed it ; but her chief feeling would have been joy that I am punished for the pleasures she has envied me .
Kitty would have been still more pleased .
She knows I was more than usually amiable to her husband .
In her eyes I am an immoral woman .
If I were immoral I could make her husband fall in love with me ... if I wanted to .
But he knows me as little as does anyone else in the world .
I know my appetites , " as the French say .
( An absurd name . ) ]
I shall tell him that when he comes back , ' she thought and smiled .
But just then she recollected that now she had no one to tell anything funny to . ' Besides , there is nothing amusing or merry .
They are ringing for vespers , and how carefully that tradesman is crossing himself , as if he were afraid of dropping something !
What are those churches , that ringing , and these lies for ?
Only to conceal the fact that we all hate each other , like those cabmen who are so angrily swearing at one another .
Yashvin says : " He wants to leave me without a shirt , and I him . "
With these thoughts , which occupied her so that she even forgot to think of her troubles , she arrived at the porch of their house .
'Is there an answer ? ' she asked .
'I will look , ' he replied , and glancing at his desk he took up and handed her the thin square envelope of a telegram .
'I cannot return before ten - Vronsky , ' she read .
'And the man has not yet returned ? '
'No , ma 'am , ' answered the hall @-@ porter .
Before quitting him for ever , I will tell him everything .
Seeing his hat on the hat @-@ rail , she shuddered with aversion .
She imagined him now calmly conversing with his mother and the Princess Sorokina , and rejoicing at her sufferings .
'Yes , I must go at once , ' she thought , not yet sure where to go to .
She wished to get away as soon as possible from the feelings she experienced in that terrible house .
The servants , the walls , the things in the house , all repelled and angered her , and oppressed her like a weight .
'Yes , I must go to the railway station , and if I don 't find him , I must go there and expose him . ' 
The train left at 8.2 p.m.
'I shall have time . ' 
She gave the order to harness another pair of horses , and busied herself packing her handbag with things necessary for a few days .
Dinner was served . She went to the table , smelt the bread and cheese and as the smell of everything eatable revolted her , she sent for the carriage and went out .
The house already threw a shadow right across the street ; the evening was bright , and the sun still warm .
Annushka , who came out with Anna 's things , and Peter , who put them into the carriage , and the coachman , who was evidently dissatisfied , were all objectionable to her and irritated her by their words and movements .
'Well , as you like , I don 't care , ' she replied with annoyance .
Again I understand it all , ' Anna said to herself as soon as the carriage started and , rocking slightly , rattled over the stones ; and again different impressions succeeded one another in her brain .
'What was the last thing I thought of that was so good ? ' She tried to remember it .
Oh yes ! What Yashvin said : the struggle for existence and hatred are the only things that unite people .
No , you are going in vain , ' she mentally addressed a company of people in a calèche with four horses , who were evidently going out of town on a spree . ' And the dog you have with you won 't help you !
Glancing in the direction in which Peter was looking she saw a workman , nearly dead @-@ drunk , with his head swaying about , who was being led off somewhere by a policeman .
'That one is more likely to , ' she thought . ' Count Vronsky and I have also been unable to find that pleasure from which we expected so much . ' 
And now for the first time Anna turned the bright light in which she saw everything upon her relations with him , about which she had always avoided thinking .
Not so much love as the satisfaction of his vanity . ' 
She remembered his words , the expression of his face , suggestive of a faithful setter 's , in the early days of their union .
Everything now confirmed her view .
'Yes , there was in him the triumph of successful vanity .
Of course there was love too ; but the greater part was pride in his success .
He boasted of me .
Now that is past .
Not to be proud but to be ashamed !
He has taken from me all he could , and now he does not need me .
He is weary of me and is trying not to act dishonourably toward me .
Yesterday he betrayed himself - he wants the divorce and a marriage in order to burn his boats .
He loves me , but how ?
'That man wants to astonish everybody and is very well satisfied with himself , ' she thought , glancing at a rosy @-@ faced shop @-@ assistant who was riding a hired horse . ' No , I have no longer the right flavour for him .
If I go away he will , at the bottom of his heart , be pleased . ' 
That was not a surmise . She saw it clearly in the piercing light which now revealed to her the meaning of life and of human relations .
'My love grows more and more passionate and egotistic , and his dwindles and dwindles , and that is why we are separating , ' she went on thinking . ' And there is no remedy .
For me everything centres in him , and I demand that he should give himself up to me more and more completely .
But he wants more and more to get away from me .
Before we were united we really drew together ; but now we are irresistibly drifting apart ; and it cannot be altered .
He tells me I am unreasonably jealous , and I have told myself that I am unreasonably jealous ; but it is not true .
I am not jealous , but dissatisfied . But ... '
And this desire awakens disgust in him , and that arouses anger in me , and it cannot be otherwise .
Don 't I know that he would not deceive me , that he has no designs on that Sorokina , that he is not in love with Kitty , and will not be unfaithful to me ?
I know all that , but that does not make it easier for me .
If , without loving me , he is kind and tender to me from a sense of duty , but what I desire is lacking - that would be a thousand times worse than anger !
It would be hell !
And that is just how it is .
And where love ceases , there hate begins ...
I don 't know these streets at all .
There is no end to them , and they all hate one another .
Well , supposing I picture to myself what I want in order to be happy ?
Well , I get divorced , and Alexis Alexandrovich gives me Serezha , and I marry Vronsky ! '
'Well , I get divorced and become Vronsky 's wife !
What then ? Will Kitty cease looking at me as she did this afternoon ?
Will Serezha stop asking and wondering about my two husbands ?
And between Vronsky and myself what new feeling can I invent ?
Is any kind - not of happiness even , but of absence of torture - possible ? No !
No ! ' she now answered herself without the least hesitation . ' It is impossible !
Life is sundering us , and I am the cause of his unhappiness and he of mine , and neither he nor I can be made different .
A beggar woman with a baby .
Are we not all flung into the world only to hate each other , and therefore to torment ourselves and others ?
Serezha ? ' she remembered . ' I thought I loved him , too , and was touched at my own tenderness for him .
Yet I lived without him and exchanged his love for another 's , and did not complain of the change as long as the other love satisfied me . ' 
And she thought with disgust of what she called ' the other love . ' 
The clearness with which she now saw her own and every one else 's life pleased her .
She had quite forgotten where and why she was going , and only understood the question by a great effort .
'Yes , ' she said , giving him her purse ; and hanging her little red handbag on her arm , she descended from the carriage .
As she moved among the crowd toward the first @-@ class waiting @-@ room she gradually recalled all the details of her position and the resolutions between which she vacillated .
And then she thought how happy life might still be , and how tormentingly she loved and hated him and how dreadfully her heart was beating .
Two noisy men became quiet as she passed them on the platform , and one of them whispered to the other something about her : something nasty , of course .
She mounted the high step of the railway carriage and seated herself in an empty compartment on the dirty - though once white - cover of the spring seat .
Peter with a stupid smile raised his gold @-@ braided hat to take leave of her ; an insolent guard slammed the door to and drew the latch .
A misshapen lady with a bustle ( Anna mentally stripped that woman and was horrified at her deformity ) and a girl , laughing affectedly , ran past outside .
'Catherine Andreevna has everything , ma tante ! ' cried the little girl .
In order not to see anyone , she rose quickly and sat down by the opposite window of the empty compartment .
A grimy , misshaped peasant in a cap from under which his tousled hair stuck out , passed that window , stooping over the carriage wheels .
'There is something familiar about that misshaped peasant , ' she thought .
And remembering her dream she went to the opposite door , trembling with fright .
The guard opened it to let in a husband and wife .
She went back to her corner and sat down .
The couple sat down opposite her , attentively but stealthily examining her dress .
Both the husband and the wife seemed to Anna disgusting .
The husband asked if she would allow him to smoke ; evidently not because he wanted to , but to enter into conversation with her .
Having received her permission , he began speaking to his wife in French , about things he wanted to speak about still less than he wanted to smoke .
They talked nonsense insincerely , only in order that she should hear them .
And it was impossible not to hate such ugly wretches .
She heard the second bell ring , and then a moving of luggage , noise , shouting and laughter .
It was so clear to Anna that no one had any cause for joy that this laughter jarred on her painfully , and she wished to stop her ears , not to hear it .
'It would be interesting to ask him what he means by it , ' thought Anna , regarding him spitefully .
Anna forgot her fellow @-@ travellers ; softly rocked by the motion of the carriage and inhaling the fresh air , she again began to think :
'Where did I leave off ?
But when you see the truth , what are you to do ? '
'Reason has been given to man to enable him to escape from his troubles , ' said the lady , in French , evidently pleased with her phrase and mincing with her tongue .
These words seemed to answer Anna 's thought .
'To escape from his troubles , ' Anna mentally repeated .
And glancing at the red @-@ cheeked husband and his thin wife , she saw that the sickly wife considered herself misunderstood , and that the husband deceived her and encouraged her in her opinion of herself .
Directing her searchlight upon them , Anna thought she saw their story and all the hidden recesses of their souls .
But there was nothing of interest there , and she continued her reflections .
'Yes , it troubles me very much , and reason was given us to enable us to escape ; therefore I must escape !
Why not put out the candle , if there is nothing more to look at ? If everything is repulsive to look at ?
Why did that guard run past holding the handrail ? Why are those young men in the next carriage shouting ?
Why are they talking and laughing ?
It 's all untrue , all lies , all deception , all evil ! ....
When the train stopped at the station , Anna got out with the crowd of passengers , and shunning them as if they were lepers , stopped on the platform trying to remember why she had come there and what she had intended to do .
Everything that had appeared possible before was now so difficult to grasp , especially in this noisy crowd of odious people who would not leave her in peace .
Recollecting that she meant to go on if there was no reply , she stopped a porter and asked him whether there was not a coachman bringing a note from Count Vronsky there .
Some one from there was here just now , to meet the Princess Sorokina and her daughter .
What is the coachman like ? '
She opened it , and her heart sank even before she read it .
'Very sorry the note did not catch me .
I shall be back at ten , ' Vronsky wrote in a careless hand .
'Yes , I expected it ! ' she said to herself with a malicious smile .
'All right , you may go home , ' she said softly to Michael .
She spoke softly , because the rapid beating of her heart impeded her breathing .
The young men did not leave her in peace .
Gazing into her face and laughing and shouting unnaturally they again passed by .
The stationmaster asked her in passing whether she was going on .
A boy selling kvas fixed his eyes on her .
'O God ! where am I to go ? ' she thought , walking further and further along the platform .
Some ladies and children , who had come to meet a spectacled gentleman and were laughing and talking noisily , became silent and gazed at her as she passed them .
She walked faster away from them to the very end of the platform .
A goods train was approaching .
The platform shook , and it seemed to her as if she were again in the tram .
Suddenly remembering the man who had been run over the day she first met Vronsky , she realized what she had to do .
Quickly and lightly descending the steps that led from the water @-@ tank to the rails , she stopped close to the passing tram .
A feeling seized her like that she had experienced when preparing to enter the water in bathing , and she crossed herself .
And at the same moment she was horror @-@ struck at what she was doing .
'Where am I ?
What am I doing ?
She wished to rise , to throw herself back , but something huge and relentless struck her on the head and dragged her down .
'God forgive me everything ! ' she said , feeling the impossibility of struggling ...
A little peasant muttering something was working at the rails .
PART VIII
It was already the middle of the hot summer , but Sergius Ivanich Koznyshev was only now preparing to leave Moscow .
In Koznyshev 's life during that time events of importance for him had taken place .
His book , the result of six years ' labour , entitled , An Attempt to Review the Foundations and Forms of Government of Europe and Russia , had been finished a year ago .
The book had been issued last year after careful revision , and had been sent out to the booksellers .
In Society , now particularly occupied with something else , absolute indifference reigned .
Koznyshev had calculated exactly the time necessary for a review to be written ; but a month passed , and another , and the silence continued .
At last , in the third month , a criticism appeared in a serious magazine .
Koznyshev knew the author of the article .
The author was a very young and sickly journalist ; very bold as a writer , but extremely uneducated , and shy in personal intercourse .
Despite his entire contempt for this man , Koznyshev began reading the review most respectfully .
The critic had evidently understood the book in an impossible way .
All this was put with so much wit that Koznyshev himself would not have been averse to wielding it ; and that was what was dreadful .
'Did not I offend him in some way ? ' he asked himself .
And remembering how when he met him he had corrected the young man 's use of a word that betrayed ignorance Koznyshev found an explanation of the article .
That review was followed by dead silence both in print and in conversation concerning the book , and Koznyshev saw that his six years ' work , carried out with so much devotion and labour , was entirely thrown away .
His position was the more painful because , having finished his book , he no longer had any literary work such as had previously occupied the greater part of his time .
He was intelligent , well @-@ educated , healthy and active , but did not know how to employ his energy .
Among the people to whom he belonged , nothing was written or talked about at that time except the Serbian war .
With much that was spoken and written on the subject Koznyshev did not agree in detail .
He admitted that the papers published much that was unnecessary and exaggerated with the sole aim of drawing attention to themselves , each outcrying the other .
He saw there was much that was frivolous and ridiculous ; but he also saw and admitted the unquestionable and ever @-@ growing enthusiasm which was uniting all classes of society , and with which one could not help sympathizing .
The massacre of our co @-@ religionists and brother Slavs evoked sympathy for the sufferers and indignation against their oppressors .
And the heroism of the Serbs and Montenegrins , fighting for a great cause , aroused in the whole nation a desire to help their brothers not only with words but by deeds .
Also there was an accompanying fact that pleased Koznyshev . It was the manifestation of public opinion .
The nation had definitely expressed its wishes .
The more he went into this question , the clearer it seemed to him that it was a matter which would attain enormous proportions and become epoch @-@ making .
He devoted himself completely to the service of that great movement and forgot to think about his book .
His whole time was now so taken up that he was unable to answer all the letters and demands addressed to him .
Katavasov , who had promised Levin to visit him , and had long been meaning to keep that promise , accompanied Koznyshev .
One of the ladies who had met the Volunteers spoke to Koznyshev at the exit from the waiting @-@ room .
'You too have come to see them off ? ' she asked in French .
And do you always come to see them off ? ' he asked with a slight smile .
'How can one help it ? ' replied the Princess . ' Is it true that eight hundred have already gone from here ?
'More than eight hundred : counting those who did not go from Moscow direct , more than a thousand , ' said Koznyshev .
I said so ! ' the lady said joyfully . ' And isn 't it true that about a million roubles have been collected ? '
'Yes , I read it , ' he answered .
They were talking of the latest telegram , confirming the report that for three consecutive days the Turks had been beaten at all points and were in flight , and that a decisive battle was expected next day .
'Oh , I say ! There is a splendid young man who wants to go .
I don 't know why they are making difficulties .
I wished to speak to you about him . I know him , please write a note for him !
Having obtained such details as the Princess could give about the young petitioner , Koznyshev went into the first @-@ class waiting @-@ room , wrote a note to the person on whom the decision depended , and gave it to the Princess .
'Do you know that the well @-@ known Count Vronsky is going by this train ? ' remarked the Princess with a triumphant and significant smile , when Koznyshev had found her again and given her the note .
'I heard he was going , but did not know when .
Going by this train ? '
He is here . Only his mother is seeing him off .
After all , it is the best thing he could do . ' 
'Oh yes , certainly . ' 
While they were speaking the crowd rushed past them toward the dining @-@ table .
Every one shouted ' Zhivio ! ' and a fresh crowd surged into the refreshment @-@ room , nearly knocking the Princess off her feet .
What do you think of that ! ' said Oblonsky , beaming with a joyous smile , as he suddenly appeared in the midst of the crowd . ' Wasn 't it finely and cordially expressed !
Bravo ! ...
'No , I am just going . ' 
'To my brother 's in the country , ' answered Koznyshev .
'Then you 'll see my wife ; I have written to her , but you 'll see her sooner . Please tell her you have seen me and it 's all right !
However , tell her , if you 'll be so kind , that I am appointed Member of the Committee of the Joint ...
Did I tell you ? '
'Yes , I have heard , ' replied Koznyshev reluctantly .
'What a pity you are going away , ' said Oblonsky . ' To @-@ morrow we are giving a dinner to two of those who are going to the war : Dmitry Bartnyansky from Petersburg and our Veslovsky - Vasenka .
Veslovsky married recently .
The Princess without replying glanced at Koznyshev .
But the fact that Koznyshev and the Princess seemed to wish to get rid of him did not abash Oblonsky in the least .
He looked smilingly now at the feather on the Princess 's bonnet and now about him , as if trying to remember something .
Noticing a lady with a collecting @-@ box he beckoned to her and put in a five @-@ rouble note .
'I can 't look calmly at those collecting @-@ boxes while I have any money , ' he remarked . ' And what a telegram that was to @-@ day !
'You don 't say so ! ' he exclaimed , when the Princess told him that Vronsky was going by that train .
'With all his faults one must do him justice , ' the Princess said to Koznyshev as soon as Oblonsky had left them . ' His is a thoroughly Russian , Slavonic nature !
Only I 'm afraid it will be painful for Vronsky to see him .
Say what you will , that man 's fate touches me .
'Yes , I might if opportunity offers . ' 
But this atones for much .
The bell rang .
Everybody thronged toward the door .
'There he is ! ' said the Princess , pointing to Vronsky who , in a long overcoat and a black broad @-@ brimmed hat , was passing with his mother on his arm .
Oblonsky walked beside him , talking with animation .
Vronsky was frowning and looking straight before him , as if not hearing what Oblonsky was saying
Probably at Oblonsky 's indication , he looked round to where Koznyshev and the Princess were standing and silently raised his hat .
On the platform ' God save the Tsar ' was struck up , followed by ' hurrah ' and ' zhivio ' !
One of the Volunteers , a tall , hollow @-@ chested , very young man , was bowing in a specially noticeable way , waving over his head a felt hat and a bouquet .
From behind him two officers and an elderly man with a large beard and a greasy cap thrust their heads out , and also bowed .
HAVING TAKEN LEAVE OF THE PRINCESS , Koznyshev with Katavasov , who had joined him , entered the very crowded carriage , and the train started .
At the Tsaritsyno station the train was met by a melodious choir of young people singing Slavsya .
[ A patriotic song . ] Again the Volunteers bowed and thrust their heads out , but Koznyshev did not pay attention to them : he had had so much to do with Volunteers that he was already familiar with their general type and it did not interest him .
Katavasov , however , whose scientific occupations had offered him no opportunities of studying the Volunteers , was much interested in them and questioned Koznyshev about them .
At the next station Katavasov followed this advice .
As soon as the train stopped he changed carriages and made acquaintance with the Volunteers .
He was evidently drunk and was speaking of something that had happened at his school .
Opposite him sat an officer , no longer young , wearing a military jacket of the Austrian Guards .
He listened smilingly to the young man and tried to stop him .
The third Volunteer , wearing an artillery uniform , sat beside them on a trunk .
Getting into conversation with the young man , Katavasov learnt that he had been a rich Moscow merchant but had run through a large fortune before he was twenty @-@ two .
Another , a retired officer , also produced an unpleasant impression on Katavasov .
He was , apparently , a man who had tried everything .
He had had a post on the railway , been a steward , and had started factories , and he talked about it all quite needlessly , using inappropriate technical terms .
He was a modest , quiet man , who evidently deferred to the knowledge of the retired Guardsman and to the heroic self @-@ sacrifice of the merchant and did not talk at all about himself .
When Katavasov asked him what prompted him to go to Serbia , he modestly replied :
One must help the Serbs .
'Yes , it 's particularly artillerymen they are short of , ' said Katavasov .
'But I have not served long in the artillery : perhaps they will put me in the infantry or cavalry . ' 
'Why into the infantry , when they need artillerymen most of all ? ' said Katavasov , concluding from the artilleryman 's age that he must have risen to a considerable rank .
'I did not serve in the artillery long . I am a retired Cadet , ' he said , and began to explain why he had not passed the examination for a commission .
All this put together produced on Katavasov a disagreeable impression , and when the Volunteers got out at a station to have a drink he wished to verify this unfavourable impression by a talk with somebody .
One of the passengers , an old man in a military overcoat , had been listening all the time to Katavasov 's conversation with the Volunteers . When they were left alone together Katavasov addressed him .
'What a variety there is in the positions of all these men who are going there ! ' Katavasov remarked vaguely , wishing to express his own opinion but at the same time to draw the old man .
The old soldier had been through two campaigns .
He knew what a military man ought to be , and by the appearance and talk of those men , and by the swagger with which they applied themselves to their flasks on the way , he considered them bad soldiers .
Besides that , he lived in a provincial town and wanted to speak of a discharged soldier of his town who had volunteered , a drunkard and thief whom no one would employ any longer .
'Well , men are wanted there , ' he said , with laughing eyes .
And so they parted without either of them having expressed his opinion .
Katavasov returning to his carriage involuntarily prevaricated ; and in telling Koznyshev his observations of the Volunteers , let it appear that they were excellent fellows .
WHEN THE TRAIN STOPPED at the Provincial capital , Koznyshev , instead of going to the refreshment @-@ room , walked up and down the platform .
The first time he passed the Vronskys ' compartment he noticed that the blind was down .
But the next time he passed he saw the old Countess at the window .
'Yes , so I heard , ' replied Koznyshev , stopping by her window and glancing inside . ' What a fine action this is of his ! ' he added , noticing that Vronsky was not there .
'Yes , but after his misfortune what could he do ? '
'What a dreadful occurrence ! ' remarked Koznyshev .
'Oh , what I have endured !
Oh , what I have endured ! ' she repeated when Koznyshev had entered and taken a seat beside her . ' You cannot imagine it !
For six weeks he spoke to no one and ate only when I implored him to .
One could not leave him a moment alone .
We took away everything that he could kill himself with . We lived on the ground floor , but one could not tell what he might do .
You know he had once before shot himself on her account ? ' she said , and the old woman 's brows knit at the recollection . ' Yes , she ended as such a woman deserved to end .
Even the death she chose was mean and low . ' 
'It is not for us to judge , Countess , ' Koznyshev remarked with a sigh , ' but I understand how distressing it was for you . ' 
I was living on my estate and he was with me .
In the evening I had only just gone to my room when my Mary told me that at the station a lady had thrown herself under a train .
I felt as if I had received a blow ! - I knew it was she !
The first thing I said was : " Don 't tell him ! "
His coachman had been there and saw it all .
When I ran to his room he was beside himself - it was terrible to see him .
I don 't know what happened there , but they brought him back like a corpse .
I should not have known him .
Then came raving madness , almost ! ... Ah , one can 't speak of it ! ' exclaimed the Countess with a gesture of her arm .
Only to prove something unusual .
She ruined herself and two splendid men - her husband and my unfortunate son . ' 
'And how about her husband ? ' inquired Koznyshev .
Alexis at first agreed to everything .
But now he is greatly distressed at having given up his daughter to a stranger .
But he can 't go back on his word .
Karenin came to the funeral ; but we tried to arrange so that he and Alexis should not meet .
For him , the husband , it is better .
But my poor son had given himself up to her entirely .
He had thrown up everything - his career , me ; and then she did not even pity him , but deliberately dealt him a deathblow .
No , say what you will , her death itself was the death of a horrid woman , without religion .
God forgive me ! I cannot help hating her memory when I see my son 's ruin ! '
'But how is he now ? '
'It is a God @-@ sent help for us , this Serbian war !
I am an old woman and understand nothing about it , but for him it is a godsend .
But it can 't be helped !
His friend , Yashvin , had lost everything at cards and was going to Serbia .
He came to see him and persuaded him to go .
Now it interests him .
Please have a talk with him . I want him to have some distraction .
Unluckily , too , his teeth have started aching .
But he will be very glad to see you .
Please have a talk with him . He is walking about on the other side . ' 
Koznyshev said he would be very pleased , and crossed over to the other platform .
IN THE SLANTING SHADOW of a pile of sacks heaped up on the platform , Vronsky , in a long overcoat , his hat pulled down low and his hands in his pockets , was walking up and down like an animal in a cage , turning sharply every twenty paces .
To Koznyshev as he approached it seemed that Vronsky saw but pretended not to see him .
He was above any personal considerations with Vronsky .
In his eyes Vronsky at that moment seemed an important worker in a great cause , and Koznyshev considered it his duty to encourage and cheer him .
He went up to him .
Vronsky paused , looked at Koznyshev , recognized him , and advancing a few steps to meet him , pressed his hand very very hard .
'Perhaps you did not wish to see me , ' said Koznyshev , ' but can I not be of some use to you ? '
'There is no one whom it would be less unpleasant for me to meet than yourself , ' returned Vronsky . ' Excuse me .
'Oh no ! ' replied Vronsky , as if it cost him an effort to understand . ' If you don 't mind , let us walk up and down .
A letter ?
No thank you . No introductions are needed to enable one to die !
Unless indeed to the Turks ! ... ' he added , smiling with his lips only .
His eyes retained their expression of angry suffering .
'Yes , but it may be easier for you to establish connections ( which will be necessary anyway ) with some one who has been prepared .
I was very glad to hear of your decision .
The Volunteers are being very much attacked and a man like yourself will raise them in public opinion . ' 
I am glad that there is something for which I can lay down the life which I not only do not want , but of which I am sick !
It will be of use to somebody , ' and he moved his jaw impatiently because of the incessant gnawing pain in his tooth , which even prevented him from speaking with the expression he desired .
'You will recover , I prophesy it , ' said Koznyshev , feeling touched . ' To free one 's brothers from oppression is an aim worth both dying and living for .
God grant you outward success and inward peace , ' he added , holding out his hand .
The acute pain in the strong tooth , filling his mouth with saliva , hindered his speaking .
Suddenly a quite different feeling , not of pain but of tormenting inward discomfort , made him for a moment forget his toothache .
He tried to recall his best moments with her but they were for ever poisoned .
He ceased to feel the pain in his tooth , and sobs distorted his face .
Having twice walked past the sacks and mastered himself , he turned calmly to Koznyshev :
'You have not seen any telegram later than yesterday 's ?
And having spoken about the proposed proclamation of Milan as King and of the immense results this might have , they returned to their respective carriages after the second bell had already sounded .
'Aren 't you ashamed of yourself for not letting us know ? ' she said , holding out her hand to him and offering her forehead for a kiss .
'We got here first @-@ rate without troubling you , ' replied Koznyshev . ' I am so dusty that I dare not touch you .
I was so busy that I did not know when I could tear myself away .
And you , as usual , ' said he ; smiling , ' are enjoying tranquil happiness outside the currents in your peaceful shadows .
'But I am not a negro ! When I have had a wash I shall look like a human being ! ' Katavasov said in his usual jesting way , holding out his hand and smiling , his teeth looking particularly bright in contrast with his black face .
'Kostya will be so pleased !
'Always busy with his husbandry !
" In the shallows " hits it exactly , ' remarked Katavasov . ' And we in town can see nothing but the Serbian war !
Surely not the same as other people ? '
'Oh , nothing in particular - the same as everybody , ' Kitty answered , rather embarrassed and glancing round at Koznyshev . ' Well , I 'll send for him .
'It 's Sergius Ivanich and Katavasov , the Professor , ' said she .
'Oh , how trying in this heat ! ' said the Prince .
'No , Papa , he is very nice , and Kostya is very fond of him , ' Kitty replied with a smile as of entreaty , having noticed a sarcastic expression on her father 's face .
'You go and entertain them , dear , ' Kitty said to her sister .
And I will run to Mitya .
He will be awake now and is certainly screaming . ' And feeling the flow of milk , she went with rapid steps to the nursery .
It was not a mere guess - the bond between herself and the baby had not yet been severed - and she knew surely by the flow of milk within herself that he was wanting food .
And so he was .
It was a fine healthy voice , only hungry and impatient .
The baby was convulsed with hungry yells .
'But one must , you know , ma 'am , ' said Agatha Mikhaylovna , who was almost always in the nursery . ' He must be properly tidied up !
Goo ! Goo ! ' she cooed to him , paying no attention to the mother .
At last , after desperate screaming and choking , matters went smoothly , and both mother and child felt calmed and were silent .
'It 's impossible !
If he knew anyone it would be me , ' Kitty replied to Agatha Mikhaylovna 's statement , and smiled .
When I do like that , he quite brightens up , the dear !
He brightens up like a sunny morning , ' said Agatha Mikhaylovna .
'Well , all right , all right ! We shall see , ' Kitty whispered . ' But now go away , he is falling asleep . ' 
If God would only , send a little rain ! ' she said .
This hand disturbed Kitty ; she wanted to kiss it , but was afraid to do so lest she should wake her baby .
At last the arm ceased waving and the eyes closed .
Only now and then the baby , continuing his business , lifted his long curved lashes and looked at his mother with moist eyes that seemed black in the dim light .
I expect he has gone to the apiary again .
Though I am sorry that he goes there so often , yet I am also glad of it .
He is more cheerful now than he was in spring .
Then he was so gloomy , and suffered so much , that I was becoming alarmed about him .
And how funny he is ! ' she whispered with a smile .
It was his want of faith .
'Why has he been reading those philosophies for a whole year ? ' she thought . ' If it 's all written in those books , he can understand it .
If what they say is untrue , why read them ?
He says himself that he would like to believe .
Then why does he not believe ?
It must be because he thinks too much .
He can 't talk to us about everything .
I think he will be glad of these visitors , especially of Katavasov .
He likes arguing with them , ' she reflected , and then turned her mind to the problem of where she had better arrange for Katavasov to sleep - in a separate room or with Koznyshev ?
And here a thought suddenly struck her which made her start with excitement and even disturb Mitya , who gave her a severe look in consequence .
'I don 't think the laundress has brought the things back and the spare sheets are all in use .
If I don 't see to it , Agatha Mikhaylovna will give Sergius Ivanich used bed @-@ linen ! ' and the very thought of this sent the blood into Kitty 's face .
'Yes , I must see about it , ' she decided , and returning to her former train of thought she remembered that there was something important , something spiritual , that she had not yet thought out and tried to recollect what it was .
'Oh yes ! Kostya is an unbeliever , ' she thought again with a smile .
'Well , he is an unbeliever !
Better let him be that than be like Madame Stahl , or like what I wanted to be when I was abroad .
No , he will never pretend . ' 
Then a recent proof of his kindness came vividly to her mind .
Two weeks before , Dolly had received a penitent letter from her husband .
He implored her to save his honour and to sell her estate to pay his debts .
Dolly was in despair ; she hated her husband , despised him , pitied him , made up her mind to divorce him and to refuse ; but ended by consenting to sell part of her estate .
And his dread of hurting anybody 's feelings , even a child 's !
Everything for others , nothing for himself !
Sergius Ivanich quite regards it as Kostya 's duty to act as his steward , and so does his sister .
And now Dolly and her children are his wards !
And then there are all those peasants who come to him every day as if it were his business to help them .
'Yes , only be like your father , only be like him ! ' she whispered , giving Mitya to the nurse , and touching his cheek with her lips .
From that moment , without thinking about it and though he continued living as he had done heretofore , Levin never ceased to feel afraid of his ignorance .
Moreover , he was vaguely conscious that what he had called his convictions were really ignorance and , more than that , were a state of mind which rendered knowledge of what he needed impossible .
For him the problem was this : ' If I don 't accept the replies offered by Christianity to the questions my life presents , what solutions do I accept ? '
And he not only failed to find in the whole arsenal of his convictions any kind of answer , but he could not even find anything resembling an answer .
He was in the position of a man seeking for food in a toyshop or at a gunsmith 's .
Involuntarily and unconsciously , in every book , in every conversation , and in every person he met , he now sought for their relation to those questions and for a solution to them .
And he studied painstakingly both the opinions of those people and the books which contained their answers .
Besides , during the time of his wife 's confinement an extraordinary thing had happened to him .
He , an unbeliever , began xo pray , and while praying believed .
But that moment had passed , and he could not allot any place in his life to the state of mind he had then experienced .
He was painfully out of harmony with himself and strained all his spiritual powers to escape from this condition .
THESE THOUGHTS OPPRESSED arid tormented him , now more and now less strongly , but never left him .
He read and thought , and the more he read and thought the further he felt from his goal .
His brother Koznyshev advised him to read Homyakov 's theological writings .
Levin read the second volume of them , and in spite of its polemical , polished , and witty style , which at first repelled him , he was struck by its teaching about the Church .
He was struck by the thought that it is not given to isolated man to attain divine truth , but that it is given to a community united by love - the Church .
All that spring he was not himself and experienced terrible moments .
'Without knowing what I am , and why I am here it is impossible to live .
Yet I cannot know that and therefore I can 't live , ' he said to himself .
'In an infinity of time , and in infinity of matter , in infinite space , a bubble , a bubble organism , separates itself , and that bubble maintains itself awhile and then bursts , and that bubble is - I ! '
This was a distressing falsehood , but it was the sole and last result of centuries and the age @-@ long labour of human thought in that direction .
But it was not only false , it was the cruel mockery of some evil power : a wicked and disgusting Power , and one to which it was impossible to submit .
It was necessary to free oneself from that Power .
An end had to be put to that dependence on an evil power ; and there was one means - death .
And though he was a happy and healthy family man , Levin was several times so near to suicide that he hid a cord he had lest he should hang himself , and he feared to carry a gun lest he should shoot himself .
But he did not hang or shoot himself and went on living .
Now , as if involuntarily , he cut ever deeper and deeper into the earth , so that he , like a ploughshare , could not get out without turning the sod .
For the family to live as their grandfathers and fathers had been accustomed to live , that is at the same educational level , and so to bring up their children , was undoubtedly necessary .
It was just as necessary as to dine when hungry ; and therefore just as it was necessary to prepare dinner , so it was necessary to arrange the husbandry at Pokrovsk in such a way as to derive an income from it .
To do this he must not lease the land , but must farm it himself , keep cattle , manure the fields , and plant woods .
All this , with game @-@ shooting , and his new hobby of beekeeping , filled up the whole of that life of his which seemed to him , when he thought about it , to have no meaning .
But besides knowing definitely what he had to do , Levin also knew how to do it all , and which affair was the more important of any two .
He knew that he must hire labourers as cheaply as possible ; but that he must not take them in bondage for less than they were worth by advancing them money , though this would be very profitable .
He might sell straw to the peasants in a time of shortage , though he felt sorry for them ; but an inn or a public @-@ house , although it brought in a revenue , must be done away with .
Felling trees must be punished as severely as possible , but if peasants let their cattle stray he must not extract fines from them ; and though it grieved the watchmen and weakened discipline , the strayed cattle must not be detained .
He must lend money to Peter to liberate him from the usurers to whom he was paying ten per cent. a month ; but he must neither reduce or postpone the payments of rent by the peasants who were in default .
The steward must not be excused when the small meadow was not mown and the grass was wasted ; but grass must not be mown on the eighty desyatinas which had been planted with young trees .
Whether he was acting well or ill he did not know and far from laying down the law about it , he now avoided talking or thinking about it .
Thinking about it led him into doubts and prevented him from seeing what he should and should not do .
THE DAY WHEN KOZNYSHEV ARRIVED at Pokrovsk was one of Levin 's most distressing days .
And this is done every year , all over Russia .
Having lived most of his life in the country and in close contact with the peasants , Levin always felt , at this busy time , that this general stimulation of the peasants communicated itself to him .
'Why is all this being done ? ' he wondered . ' Why am I standing here , obliging them to work ?
Why do they all make such efforts and try to show me their zeal ?
Yet he loosens the sheaves and gives directions , shouts at the women , and quickly puts right the strap on the fly @-@ wheel .
And , moreover , not they only but I too shall be buried and nothing will be left .
He thought this , and at the same time looked at his watch to calculate how much they could thresh in an hour .
He had to know this in order to set them their day 's task accordingly .
Theodore , black with the dust that stuck to his perspiring face , shouted something in reply , but still did not do as Levin wished .
Levin went up to the roller , motioned Theodore aside and himself began feeding the machine .
Theodore came from the farther village , the one where Levin had formerly let the land to be worked co @-@ operatively .
At present it was let to the innkeeper .
Levin got into conversation with Theodore about that land , and asked whether Plato , a well @-@ to @-@ do. and worthy peasant of that village , would not rent that land next year .
'The rent is too high , Constantine Dmitrich , ' answered Theodore , picking out the ears of rye from the front of his damp shirt .
'But how does Kirilov make it pay ? '
'Why shouldn 't Mityuka ' ( as he contemptuously called the innkeeper ) ' make it pay , Constantine Dmitrich ?
But as if Daddy Plato would ever skin a man ! He 'll lend , and sometimes let a man off , and so run short himself .
'But why should he let anyone off ? '
Oh well , you see , people differ ! One man lives only for his own needs : take Mityuka , who only stuffs his own belly , but Plato is an upright old man .
He lives for his soul and remembers God . ' 
'You know how : rightly , in a godly way .
You know , people differ !
Take you , for instance , you won 't injure anyone either ... '
'Yes , yes ! Good @-@ bye ! ' uttered Levin , gasping with excitement , and turning away , he took his stick and walked quickly away toward home .
LEVIN WENT ALONG THE HIGH @-@ ROAD with long strides , attending not so much to his thoughts - he could not yet disentangle them - as to a condition of his soul he had never before experienced .
The words the peasant had spoken produced in his soul the effect of an electric spark , suddenly transforming and welding into one a whole group of disjointed impotent separate ideas which had always interested him .
These ideas , though he had been unconscious of them , had been in his mind when he was talking about letting the land .
He felt something new in his soul and probed this something with pleasure , not yet knowing what it was .
'To live not for one 's needs but for God !
For what God ?
What could be more senseless than what he said ?
And did I not understand those senseless words of Theodore 's ?
And having understood them , did I doubt their justice ? Did I find them stupid , vague , or inexact ?
'No , I understood him just as he understands them : understood completely and more clearly than I understand anything in life ; and I have never in my life doubted it , and cannot doubt it . And not I alone but every one - the whole world - only understands that completely .
Nobody is free from doubt about other things , but nobody ever doubts this one thing , everybody always agrees with it . { ? ? }
'Theodore says that Kirilov , the innkeeper , lives for his belly .
We all , as reasoning creatures , cannot live otherwise .
And then that same Theodore says that it is wrong to live for one 's belly , and that we must live for Truth , for God , and at the first hint I understand him !
Therefore goodness is beyond the chain of cause and effect .
'It is exactly this that I know and that we all know .
{ ? ? } ' And I sought for miracles , regretted not to see a miracle that might convince me !
A physical miracle would have tempted me . But here is a miracle , the one possible , everlasting miracle , all around me , and I did not notice it !
'What greater miracle could there be than that ?
That feeling was so joyous that it seemed questionable to him .
He was breathless with excitement and , incapable of going further , he turned from the road into the wood and sat down on the uncut grass in the shade of the aspens .
Taking the hat from his perspiring head , he lay down , leaning his elbow upon the juicy , broad @-@ bladed forest grass .
And in all of us , including the aspens and the clouds and nebulae , evolution is proceeding .
Unending evolution and struggle ...
As if there could be any direction and struggle in infinity !
And I was surprised that , in spite of the greatest effort of thought on that path , the meaning of life , the meaning of my impulses and my aspirations , was not revealed to me .
'I have discovered nothing .
I have understood the Power that not only gave me life in the past but is giving me life now .
I have freed myself from deception and learnt to know my Master .
He briefly reviewed the whole course of his thoughts during the last two years , beginning with the clear and obvious thought of death at the sight of his beloved brother hopelessly ill .
But he had done neither the one nor the other , yet he continued to live , think , and feel , had even at that very time got married , experienced many joys , and been happy whenever he was not thinking of the meaning of his life .
What did that show ?
He had lived ( without being conscious of it ) by those spiritual truths which he had imbibed with his mother 's milk ; but in thought he had not only not acknowledged those truths , but had studiously evaded them .
Now it was clear to him that he was only able to live , thanks to the beliefs in which he had been brought up .
'What should I have been and how should I have lived my life , if I had not had those beliefs , and had not known that one must live for God , and not for one 's own needs ?
Nothing of that which constitutes the chief joys of my life would have existed for me . ' 
And although he made the greatest efforts of imagination , he could not picture to himself the bestial creature he would have been , had he not known what he was living for .
'I looked for an answer to my question .
But reason could not give me an answer - reason is incommensurable with the question .
Life itself has given me the answer , in my knowledge of what is good and what is bad .
And that knowledge I did not acquire in any way ; it was given to me as to everybody , given because I could not take it from anywhere .
Was it by reason that I attained to the knowledge that I must love my neighbour and not throttle him ?
They told me so when I was a child , and I gladly believed it , because they told me what was already in my soul .
But who discovered it ?
Reason has discovered the struggle for existence and the law that I must throttle all those who hinder the satisfaction of my desires .
But the law of loving others could not be discovered by reason , because it is unreasonable . ' 
'Ah yes ! Pride ! ' he said to himself , turning over face downwards and beginning to tie blades of grass into knots , trying not to break them .
'And not only mental pride but mental stupidity .
And chiefly roguery of mind , precisely roguery .
Just mind @-@ swindling , ' he repeated .
LEVIN REMEMBERED A RECENT SCENE between Dolly and her children .
Left by themselves , the children had started cooking raspberries over a candle , and pouring jets of milk into their mouths .
And Levin was struck by the quiet dull disbelief with which the children listened to these remarks from their mother .
They were only grieved that their amusing game had been ended , and they did not believe a word of what she was saying .
And they could not believe it , because they could not imagine the whole volume of all they consumed , and therefore could not conceive that what they were destroying was the very thing they lived on .
'That 's quite a different matter , ' they thought . ' And not in the least interesting or important , because those things always have been and always will be .
Now we 've thought of putting raspberries in a cup and cooking them over a candle , and of pouring milk into each other 's mouths like fountains .
That is amusing and new , and not at all worse than drinking out of cups . ' 
'Don 't we , and didn 't I , do just the same , when intellectually I sought for the meaning of the forces of nature and the purpose of human life ? ' he went on thinking .
'Supposing now that the children were left alone to procure or make cups for themselves and to milk the cows and so on .
Would they play tricks ?
No , they would die of hunger !
Suppose we , with our passions and thoughts , were left without the conception of God a Creator , and without a conception of what is good , and without an explanation of moral evil !
'Try to build up anything without these conceptions !
'We destroy because we have our fill spiritually .
'Whence comes the joyful knowledge I have in common with the peasant , and which alone gives me peace of mind ?
'Yes , what I know , I know not by my reason but because it has been given to me , revealed to me , and I know it in my heart by faith in the chief thing which the Church proclaims .
Levin repeated to himself . He turned over , and leaning on his elbows began looking at a herd of cattle in the distance approaching the river on the other side .
'But can I believe in all that the Church professes ? ' he asked himself , testing himself by everything which might destroy his present peace of mind .
He purposely thought of those teachings of the Church which always seemed most strange to him , and that tried him .
By existence !
By nothing ! - The devil and sin ? - And how do I explain evil ? ...
A Saviour ? ...
'But I know nothing , nothing ! And can know nothing but what is told to me and to everybody . ' 
And it now seemed to him that there was not one of the dogmas of the Church which could disturb the principal thing - faith in God , in goodness , as the sole vocation of man .
Lying on his back he was now gazing at the high cloudless sky .
'Don 't I know that that is infinite space , and not a rounded vault ?
Levin ceased to think , and only as it were hearkened to mystic voices that seemed to be joyously and earnestly discussing something .
That occurred to him only when the coachman drove up and called to him .
'The mistress has sent me !
Your brother and another gentleman have come ! '
Levin got into the trap and took the reins .
As if just awakened from a dream , it was long before he could collect his thoughts .
His brother , his wife , and the unknown visitor appeared in a different light to him now .
It seemed to him that his relations with every one would now be changed .
'Please leave it alone and don 't teach me ! ' said Levin , annoyed at the coachman 's interference .
When they were still a quarter of a verst from the house , Levin saw Grisha and Tanya running toward him .
Mama is coming and Grandpapa and Sergius Ivanich , and some one else ! ' they cried , clambering into the trap .
'An awfully dreadful man !
And he goes like that with his hands , ' said Tanya , standing up in the trap and mimicking Katavasov .
'Young or old ? ' asked Levin with a laugh , as Tanya 's gestures reminded him of some one .
'Oh , if only it is not some one disagreeable ! ' he thought .
Katavasov was very fond of talking about philosophy , having a conception of it which he had acquired from naturalists who had never studied it , and in Moscow Levin had latterly had many disputes with him .
One of those disputes , in which Katavasov evidently thought he had been the victor , was the first thing Levin remembered when he recognized him .
'But I will not now on any account dispute or express my opinions lightly , ' he thought .
After alighting from the trap and welcoming his brother and Katavasov , Levin asked where Kitty was .
'She has taken Mitya to Kola , ' which was a wood not far from the house .
'She wanted to let him sleep there ; it 's so hot in the house , ' said Dolly .
Levin always advised his wife not to take the child into the wood , considering it dangerous , and this news was disagreeable to him .
'She wanders about with him from place to place , ' said the old Prince with a smile . ' I advised her to try taking him to the ice @-@ cellar ! '
'She meant to come to the apiary .
She thought you were there .
'Well , and what are you doing ? ' asked Koznyshev , lagging behind with his brother .
'Oh , nothing particular .
Busy with the estate as usual , ' answered Levin . ' Have you come for a good stay ?
'For about a fortnight .
He dropped his own eyes , not knowing what to say .
'Have any reviews of your book appeared ? ' he asked .
Koznyshev smiled at the obvious intent of the question .
'No one concerns himself with it , and I least of all , ' he replied . ' Look there , Darya Alexandrovna ! It 's going to rain , ' he added , pointing with his umbrella to some white clouds that had appeared above the aspen trees .
And those words were enough to re @-@ establish between the brothers the not exactly hostile , but cold , relations which Levin so wished to avoid .
'How right you were to come ! ' he said .
'No , I have not finished him , ' replied Levin . ' However , I don 't need him now . ' 
'Well , I have finally convinced myself that I shan 't find solutions of the questions I am concerned about in him , or in people of his kind .
Now ... '
But he was suddenly struck by the calm and cheerful expression of Katavasov 's face , and felt so sorry to lose the spiritual condition which he was evidently spoiling by his conversation , that recollecting his resolution he ceased speaking .
'However , we 'll have a talk later on , ' he said . ' If we are going to the apiary , it 's this way , along this path , ' he added , addressing the whole party .
Trying to make as few brusque movements as possible and listening to the bees that flew past him more and more often , he went along the path to the hut .
At the very entrance a bee became entangled in his beard and began buzzing , but he carefully liberated it .
On the other side of the fence an old man was making a hoop and did not notice Levin , who stopped in the middle of the apiary without calling him .
He was glad of this opportunity to be alone and recover from reality , which had already so lowered his spiritual condition .
He remembered that he had already got angry with Ivan , treated his brother coldly , and spoken heedlessly to Katavasov .
'Can it possibly have been but a momentary mood that will pass without leaving a trace ? ' he wondered .
But at that instant returning into that mood , he felt with joy that something new and important had occurred within him .
Reality had temporarily veiled the spiritual tranquillity he had found , but it remained with him .
And as , in spite of the bees , his physical powers remained intact , so his newly realized spiritual powers were intact also .
'KOSTYA ! DO YOU KNOW with whom Sergius Ivanich travelled coming here ? ' said Dolly , after she had distributed cucumbers and honey among the children .
'Yes , and not alone , but is taking a squadron at his own expense ! ' said Katavasov .
'That is like him , ' said Levin . ' But are Volunteers really still going ? ' he added with a glance at Koznyshev .
Koznyshev did not reply , but with the blunt side of a knife carefully extracted from a bowl in which lay a wedge of white honeycomb a live bee that had stuck in the running honey .
You should have seen what went on at the station yesterday ! ' said Katavasov , audibly biting into a cucumber .
'Well , how is one to understand it ?
In heaven 's name , Sergius Ivanich , explain to me where all these Volunteers are going and whom they are fighting , ' said the old Prince , evidently continuing a conversation that had been started during Levin 's absence .
'The Turks ! ' answered Koznyshev , quietly smiling , having extracted the bee which , black with honey , moved its legs helplessly. as he shifted it from the knife to a firm aspen leaf .
'But who has declared war on Turkey ?
Ivan Ivanich Ragozov and the Countess Lydia Ivanovna , assisted by Madame Stahl ? '
'No one has declared war , but people sympathize with their suffering neighbours and wish to help them , ' replied Koznyshev .
'But the Prince is not talking of help , ' interposed Levin , taking his father @-@ in @-@ law 's side , ' but of war !
He says that private people cannot take part in war without the consent of the Government . ' 
'Kostya , look ! Here 's a bee !
Really , we shall get stung ! ' cried Dolly , waving away a wasp .
'But that 's not a bee , it 's a wasp , ' said Levin .
'Well , and what is your theory ? ' asked Katavasov with a smile , evidently challenging Levin to a discussion . ' Why have private individuals no right ? '
On the other hand , by law and by common sense , in the affairs of State and especially in the matter of war , citizens renounce their personal will . ' 
Koznyshev and Katavasov , ready with their rejoinders , began speaking both together .
'That 's just the point , my dear fellow , that cases may arise when the Government does not fulfil the will of its citizens and then Society announces its own will , ' said Katavasov .
But Koznyshev evidently did not approve of this reply .
Our brothers by blood and religion are being killed .
Well , say they were not even our brothers or co @-@ religionists , but simply children , women , and old people ; one 's feelings are outraged , and Russians hasten to help to stop those horrors .
'But I would not kill the man , ' replied Levin .
If I saw such a thing , I might yield to my instinctive feeling ; I can 't say beforehand .
'Perhaps you have none , but others have , ' said Koznyshev with a dissatisfied frown . ' Among the people there live traditions of Orthodox Christians suffering under the yoke of the " Infidel Mussulman . "
'Perhaps , ' said Levin evasively , ' but I don 't see it . I myself am one of the people , and I don 't feel it . ' 
I was much grieved and thought I was a monster or that the Karlsbad waters had that effect on me !
But on getting back I was relieved , for I see that there are others besides me who are only interested in Russia and not in their brother @-@ Slavs .
'Personal opinions don 't count in this matter ; ' said Koznyshev . ' It is not an affair of personal opinions , when all Russia - the people - has expressed its will . ' 
'But , forgive me , I don 't see it .
The people know nothing about it , ' said the Prince .
'But what was there in church on Sunday ?
'The people can 't help knowing . A consciousness of their destiny always exists in the people , and at moments like the present it becomes clear to them , ' said Koznyshev positively , glancing at the old beekeeper .
The handsome old man , with a black beard turning grey in places and thick silvery hair , stood motionless with a bowl of honey in his hand , gazing kindly and calmly down from his height at the gentlefolk , clearly neither understanding them nor wishing to understand .
'That 's just so , ' he said to Koznyshev , and moved his head significantly .
He neither knows nor thinks about it , ' said Levin . ' Have you heard about the war , Mikhaylich ? ' he asked , addressing the old man .
'What they read in the church ?
'Why should we think ?
Alexander Nikolayevich , the Emperor , has thought for us , and will think for us on all matters .
He can see better ...
Shall I bring some more bread and give the laddie a bit ? ' he asked Dolly , pointing to Grisha , who was finishing his crust .
What does that mean ? '
'I tell you it 's not hundreds , and not the happy @-@ go @-@ lucky people , but the best representatives of the people ! ' said Koznyshev , as irritably as if he were defending the last of his possessions . ' And the donations ?
'That word people is so indefinite , ' said Levin . ' Clerks in district offices , schoolmasters , and one out of a thousand peasants , may know what it is all about .
The rest of the eighty millions , like Mikhaylich , not only don 't express their will , but have not the least idea what it is they have to express it about !
What right have we then to say it is the will of the people ? '
KOZNYSHEV , AN EXPERIENCED DIALECTICIAN , did not rejoin but immediately turned the conversation into another region .
'Well , if you want to gauge the national spirit arithmetically , of course that is very difficult to do !
Voting has not been introduced in our country , and cannot be because it does not express the people 's will , but there are other means .
Not to mention the undercurrents that have stirred in the motionless sea of the nation and which are evident to every unprejudiced person , look at Society in the narrower sense !
The most divergent parties in the intellectual world , previously so hostile to one another , have all merged into one .
All differences are at an end , and all the social organs say one and the same thing , all have felt an elemental force that has seized them and carries them all in one direction . ' 
'Yes , all the papers say the same thing , ' said the Prince , ' that 's true .
So much the same that they are just like frogs before a storm !
They prevent our hearing anything else ! '
'Frogs or no frogs ... I don 't publish a newspaper and don 't want to defend them , but I am speaking of the unanimity of the intelligent world , ' said Koznyshev , turning to his brother . Levin was going to reply , but the old Prince interrupted him .
'Yes , he asked me to tell Darya Alexandrovna that he has got the post , ' said Koznyshev discontentedly , considering that what the Prince was saying was not to the point .
'So it is with the unanimity of the Press .
It has been explained to me : as soon as there is a war their revenue is doubled .
How can they help considering that the fate of the people and the Slavs - and all the rest of it ? '
'There are many papers I don 't like , but that is unfair , ' said Koznyshev .
'I would make only one stipulation , ' continued the Prince . ' Alphonse Karr put it very well , before the war with Prussia .
" You think war unavoidable .
He who preaches war - off with him in a special legion to the assault , to the attack , in front of everybody else ! " -'
'The editors would be fine ! ' remarked Katavasov , laughing loudly , and picturing to himself the editors of his acquaintance in that chosen legion .
'Oh , but they 'd run away , ' said Dolly , ' and only be a hindrance . ' 
'And if they run , put grapeshot behind them , or Cossacks with whips ! ' said the Prince .
'That is a joke , and excuse me , Prince , not a good joke , ' said Koznyshev .
'I don 't see that it is a joke , that ... ' began Levin , but Koznyshev interrupted him .
'Every member of Society is called upon to do his proper task , ' he said . ' And men of thought perform theirs by expressing public opinion .
The unanimous and complete expression of public opinion is a service rendered by the Press , and is also a gratifying phenomenon .
Twenty years ago we should have been silent , but now we hear the voice of the Russian people , who are ready to arise as one man and to sacrifice themselves for their oppressed brethren . That is a great step and a sign of power ! '
You know that expression is a puzzling one for a naturalist .
What is a soul ? ' Katavasov inquired with a smile .
'Oh , you know ! '
'No , I swear I have not the slightest idea ! ' said Katavasov , laughing loudly .
'That 's just so ! ' repeated the old man , who was standing near by , answering a glance that was accidentally thrown at him .
'No , my dear sir ! You are beaten ! Completely beaten ! ' shouted Katavasov merrily .
Levin flushed with annoyance , not at being beaten , but because he had not refrained from the dispute .
'No , I must not dispute with them , ' he thought . ' They are clad in impenetrable armour , and I am naked . ' 
He saw that it was not possible to convince his brother and Katavasov , and still less did he see any possibility of himself agreeing with them .
What they advocated was that same pride of intellect that had nearly ruined him .
We joyfully promise complete obedience .
All labours , all humiliations , all sacrifices we take upon ourselves ; but we will not judge or decide ! '
But the people now , according to his brother , were renouncing that exemption they had purchased at so high a price .
He wanted to ask why , if public opinion is an infallible judge , is a Revolution and a Commune " ' not as lawful as the movement in favour of the Slavs ?
But all these were thoughts that could not decide anything .
THE PRINCE AND KOZNYSHEV GOT INTO THE TRAP and drove off ; the rest of the party , hastening their steps , went home on foot .
But the cloud , now whiter now blacker , approached so rapidly that it was necessary to hurry still more to reach home before the rain came .
The fore part of the cloud , low and black like sooty smoke , rushed with unusual swiftness across the sky .
When they were still about two hundred paces from the house the wind had already risen , so that at any moment a downpour might be expected .
Dolly , struggling with difficulty with the skirts that clung to her legs , no longer walked but ran , her eyes fixed on the children .
The men , holding their hats , went on with long strides .
They were just reaching the porch when a large drop broke against the edge of the iron gutter .
'In Kolok , I expect , and Nurse is with them . ' 
Levin snatched up the plaids and rushed to the Kolok .
In that short time the centre of the cloud had already so moved over the sun that it was as dark as during an eclipse .
A white curtain of pouring rain was already descending over the distant wood and half the neighbouring field , and was advancing rapidly toward the Kolok .
The moisture of the rain , shattered into minute drops , filled the air .
'Oh God !
Oh God ! only not on them ! ' he said .
Having run to the spot where they generally went , he did not find them there .
They were at the other end of the wood , under an old lime tree , and were calling him .
Two figures in dark dresses ( they had been light @-@ coloured before ) stood bending over something .
They were Kitty and the nurse .
The rain was already passing and it was growing lighter when Levin reached them .
The bottom of the nurse 's dress was dry , but Kitty 's dress was wet through and clung close to her .
Though the rain had stopped , they were still standing in the same postures that they had adopted when the storm began : they stood leaning over a perambulator with a green hood .
Safe ?
Thank God ! ' he muttered , running up to them and splashing through the puddles with one shoe half off and full of water .
Kitty 's wet and rosy face was turned to him , timidly smiling beneath her bedraggled hat .
I don 't understand how one can be so imprudent ! ' he reproached his wife in his vexation .
I was just wishing to go when he became restless .
We had to change his things .
We had hardly ... ' Kitty began excusing herself .
Mitya was safe and dry and slept undisturbed .
I don 't know what I am saying ! '
After the rain it was too wet to go out walking , besides which the thunder @-@ clouds had not cleared from the horizon , and , now here now there , passed thundering and darkening along the borders of the sky .
No more disputes arose ; on the contrary , after dinner every one was in the best of spirits .
Koznyshev too was in good spirits and at tea , led on by his brother , expounded his views of the future of the Eastern question , and did it so simply and well that every one listened attentively .
Only Kitty could not hear him to the end , she was called away to bath Mitya .
A few minutes after she had gone , Levin too was called to her in the nursery .
Leaving his tea and regretting the interruption in the interesting conversation , yet uneasy as to why he was sent for , as this only happened on important occasions ; Levin went to the nursery .
He did not now recall , as he had done before , the whole course of his thoughts ( he did not now need to ) .
He at once returned to the feeling that directed him , which was related to those thoughts , and he found that feeling in his soul yet more powerful and definite than before .
Now it was not as it used to be with him when he. had invented ways of tranquillizing himself and had been obliged to recapitulate the whole train of reflections in order to arrive at the feeling .
Now , on the contrary , the feelings of joy and tranquillity were more vivid than before and his thoughts could not keep pace with them .
Just as he was entering the nursery he remembered what it was he had hidden from himself .
It was that if the principal proof of the existence of a Deity is His revelation of what is good , why is that revelation confined to the Christian Church alone ?
What relation to that revelation have the Buddhist and the Mahomedan faiths , which also teach and do good ?
It seemed to him that he had a reply to that question ; but he had no time to express it to himself before he entered the nursery .
Kitty was standing , with her sleeves rolled up , beside the bath in which the baby was splashing about , and hearing her husband 's step she turned her face toward him , beckoning him with a smile .
With one hand supporting the head of the plump kicking baby who floated on his back , with the other she squeezed the water from a sponge over him , regularly exerting the muscles of her arm .
'There , come and look ! Look ! ' she said when her husband came up .
The point was that Mitya had that day obviously and undoubtedly begun to recognize his own people .
Directly Levin approached the bath he was shown an experiment which succeeded perfectly .
The cook , who had been called specially for the purpose , bent over him .
Kitty bent over him , and his face lit up with a smile , he pressed his hand into the sponge and bubbled with his lips , producing such a contented and peculiar sound that not only Kitty and the nurse , but Levin too went into unexpected raptures .
You said you felt nothing for him . ' 
'No , did I say I felt nothing ?
I only said I was disillusioned . ' 
'What ! Disillusioned with him ? '
'Not so much with him as with my own feeling ; I had expected more .
I had expected that , like a surprise , a new , pleasant feeling would awaken in me .
And then instead of that , nothing but repulsion and pity ... '
She listened attentively , replacing on her slender fingers , across the baby , the rings she had taken off to bath Mitya .
'And above all , the anxiety and pity were far greater than the pleasure .
'Were you very frightened ? ' she asked . ' I was too , but to me it appears more dreadful now that it is past .
But how nice Katavasov is !
And in general the whole day has been so pleasant .
And you are so nice to your brother when you like ...
It is always hot and steamy here after the bath . ' 
WHEN ON LEAVING THE NURSERY Levin was alone , he at once remembered the thought that had not seemed quite clear .
Instead of going back to the drawing @-@ room , whence came the sound of voices , he stopped on the verandah and leaning on the balustrade gazed at the sky .
It had grown quite dark , and to the south , where he was looking , the sky was clear .
The clouds were in the opposite direction .
There lightning flashed and distant thunder rolled .
Levin listened to the rhythmical dripping of raindrops from the lime trees in the garden , and looked at a familiar triangular constellation and at the Milky Way which with its branches intersected it .
At every flash of lightning not only the Milky Way but even the bright stars vanished ; but immediately afterwards they reappeared in the same places , as if thrown there by some unerring hand .
'Well , what is perplexing me ? ' Levin asked himself , feeling in advance that the solution of his doubts , though as yet unknown to him , was already in his soul .
'And could the astronomers understand and calculate anything if they took into their calculation the whole of the complicated and varied motions of the earth ?
The question of other creeds and their relation to the Deity I have not the right or possibility of deciding . ' 
But she would not have been able to discern its expression had not a flash of lightning that effaced the stars lit it up .
By the light of that flash she saw the whole of his face and , noticing that he was calm and happy , she smiled at him .
Shall I tell her or not ?
Yes , I will ... '
Be good and go to the corner room and see how they have arranged things for Sergius Ivanich !
'Yes , certainly I will , ' said Levin , standing upright and kissing her .
'No , I had better not tell her , ' he thought when she had passed out before him . ' It is a secret , necessary and important for me alone , and inexpressible in words . ' 
'This new feeling has not changed me , has not rendered me happy , nor suddenly illuminated me as I dreamt it would , but is just like my feeling for my son .
It has not been a surprise either .
But be it faith or not - I do not know what it is - this feeling has also entered imperceptibly through suffering and is firmly rooted in my soul .
