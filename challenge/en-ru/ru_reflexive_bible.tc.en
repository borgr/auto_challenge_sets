that you might fear Yahweh your God , to keep all his statutes and his commandments , which I command you , you , and your son , and your son 's son , all the days of your life ; and that your days may be prolonged .
these words , which I command you this day , shall be on your heart ;
you shall write them on the door posts of your house , and on your gates .
neither shall you make marriages with them ; your daughter you shall not give to his son , nor shall you take his daughter for your son .
for he will turn away your son from following me , that they may serve other gods : so the anger of Yahweh would be kindled against you , and he would destroy you quickly .
it shall happen , because you listen to these ordinances , and keep and do them , that Yahweh your God will keep with you the covenant and the loving kindness which he swore to your fathers :
you shall consume all the peoples whom Yahweh your God shall deliver to you ; your eye shall not pity them : neither shall you serve their gods ; for that will be a snare to you .
he will deliver their kings into your hand , and you shall make their name to perish from under the sky : no man shall be able to stand before you , until you have destroyed them .
you shall remember all the way which Yahweh your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness , that he might humble you , to prove you , to know what was in your heart , whether you would keep his commandments , or not .
you shall consider in your heart that as a man chastens his son , so Yahweh your God chastens you .
who led you through the great and terrible wilderness , with fiery serpents and scorpions , and thirsty ground where there was no water ; who brought you forth water out of the rock of flint ;
but you shall remember Yahweh your God , for it is he who gives you power to get wealth ; that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers , as at this day .
so I turned and came down from the mountain , and the mountain was burning with fire : and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands .
at that time Yahweh said to me , " Cut two tables of stone like the first , and come up to me onto the mountain , and make an ark of wood .
for the land , where you go in to possess it , isn 't as the land of Egypt , that you came out from , where you sowed your seed , and watered it with your foot , as a garden of herbs ;
I will give grass in your fields for your livestock , and you shall eat and be full .
you shall write them on the door posts of your house , and on your gates ;
these are the statutes and the ordinances which you shall observe to do in the land which Yahweh , the God of your fathers , has given you to possess it , all the days that you live on the earth .
you shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dispossess served their gods , on the high mountains , and on the hills , and under every green tree :
but in the place which Yahweh shall choose in one of your tribes , there you shall offer your burnt offerings , and there you shall do all that I command you .
when Yahweh your God shall enlarge your border , as he has promised you , and you shall say , " I want to eat meat , " because your soul desires to eat meat ; you may eat meat , after all the desire of your soul .
observe and hear all these words which I command you , that it may go well with you , and with your children after you forever , when you do that which is good and right in the eyes of Yahweh your God .
you shall not do so to Yahweh your God : for every abomination to Yahweh , which he hates , have they done to their gods ; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods .
if you shall hear tell concerning one of your cities , which Yahweh your God gives you to dwell there , saying ,
nothing of the devoted thing shall cling to your hand ; that Yahweh may turn from the fierceness of his anger , and show you mercy , and have compassion on you , and multiply you , as he has sworn to your fathers ;
you shall surely tithe all the increase of your seed , that which comes forth from the field year by year .
the Levite who is within your gates , you shall not forsake him ; for he has no portion nor inheritance with you .
this is the way of the release : every creditor shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor ; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother ; because Yahweh 's release has been proclaimed .
for the poor will never cease out of the land : therefore I command you , saying , You shall surely open your hand to your brother , to your needy , and to your poor , in your land .
if your brother , a Hebrew man , or a Hebrew woman , is sold to you , and serves you six years ; then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you .
when you let him go free from you , you shall not let him go empty :
you shall furnish him liberally out of your flock , and out of your threshing floor , and out of your winepress ; as Yahweh your God has blessed you , you shall give to him .
it shall be , if he tells you , " I will not go out from you " ; because he loves you and your house , because he is well with you ;
you shall eat it within your gates : the unclean and the clean shall eat it alike , as the gazelle , and as the hart .
you shall keep the feast of weeks to Yahweh your God with a tribute of a freewill offering of your hand , which you shall give , according as Yahweh your God blesses you :
you shall keep the feast of tents seven days , after that you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress :
you shall make judges and officers in all your gates , which Yahweh your God gives you , according to your tribes ; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment .
if there is found in the midst of you , within any of your gates which Yahweh your God gives you , man or woman , who does that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God , in Transgressing his covenant ,
if there arises a matter too hard for you in judgment , between blood and blood , between plea and plea , and between stroke and stroke , being matters of controversy within your gates ; then you shall arise , and go up to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose ;
the man who does presumptuously , in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before Yahweh your God , or to the judge , even that man shall die : and you shall put away the evil from Israel .
you shall surely set him king over yourselves , whom Yahweh your God shall choose : one from among your brothers you shall set king over you ; you may not put a foreigner over you , who is not your brother .
and it shall be with him , and he shall read therein all the days of his life ; that he may learn to fear Yahweh his God , to keep all the words of this law and these statutes , to do them ;
then he shall minister in the name of Yahweh his God , as all his brothers the Levites do , who stand there before Yahweh .
you shall be perfect with Yahweh your God .
you shall set apart three cities for you in the midst of your land , which Yahweh your God gives you to possess it .
this is the case of the manslayer , that shall flee there and live : whoever kills his neighbor unawares , and didn 't hate him in time past ;
if Yahweh your God enlarges your border , as he has sworn to your fathers , and gives you all the land which he promised to give to your fathers ;
that innocent blood not be shed in the midst of your land , which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance , and so blood be on you .
you shall not remove your neighbor 's landmark , which they of old time have set , in your inheritance which you shall inherit , in the land that Yahweh your God gives you to possess it .
the officers shall speak to the people , saying , " What man is there who has built a new house , and has not dedicated it ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man dedicate it .
what man is there who has planted a vineyard , and has not used its fruit ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man use its fruit .
what man is there who has pledged to be married a wife , and has not taken her ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her . "
the officers shall speak further to the people , and they shall say , " What man is there who is fearful and fainthearted ? let him go and return to his house , lest his brother 's heart melt as his heart . "
and when Yahweh your God delivers it into your hand , you shall strike every male of it with the edge of the sword :
that they not teach you to do after all their abominations , which they have done to their gods ; so would you sin against Yahweh your God .
all the elders of that city , who are nearest to the slain man , shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley ;
and see among the captives a beautiful woman , and you have a desire to her , and would take her to you as wife ;
then you shall bring her home to your house ; and she shall shave her head , and pare her nails ;
if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son , who will not obey the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and , though they chasten him , will not listen to them ;
a woman shall not wear men 's clothing , neither shall a man put on women 's clothing ; for whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh your God .
when you build a new house , then you shall make a battlement for your roof , that you don 't bring blood on your house , if any man fall from there .
you shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed , lest the whole fruit be forfeited , the seed which you have sown , and the increase of the vineyard .
you shall make yourselves fringes on the four borders of your cloak , with which you cover yourself .
but to the lady you shall do nothing ; there is in the lady no sin worthy of death : for as when a man rises against his neighbor , and kills him , even so is this matter ;
then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady 's father fifty shekels of silver , and she shall be his wife , because he has humbled her ; he may not put her away all his days .
you shall not deliver to his master a servant who is escaped from his master to you :
you shall not bring the hire of a prostitute , or the wages of a dog , into the house of Yahweh your God for any vow : for even both these are an abomination to Yahweh your God .
you shall not lend on interest to your brother ; interest of money , interest of food , interest of anything that is lent on interest :
to a foreigner you may lend on interest ; but to your brother you shall not lend on interest , that Yahweh your God may bless you in all that you put your hand to , in the land where you go in to possess it .
when you shall vow a vow to Yahweh your God , you shall not be slack to pay it : for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you ; and it would be sin in you .
that which is gone out of your lips you shall observe and do ; according as you have vowed to Yahweh your God , a freewill offering , which you have promised with your mouth .
if the latter husband hate her , and write her a bill of divorce , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house ; or if the latter husband die , who took her to be his wife ;
when you do lend your neighbor any kind of loan , you shall not go into his house to get his pledge .
you shall stand outside , and the man to whom you do lend shall bring forth the pledge outside to you .
you shall surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goes down , that he may sleep in his garment , and bless you : and it shall be righteousness to you before Yahweh your God .
you shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy , whether he be of your brothers , or of your foreigners who are in your land within your gates :
when you reap your harvest in your field , and have forgot a sheaf in the field , you shall not go again to get it : it shall be for the foreigner , for the fatherless , and for the widow ; that Yahweh your God may bless you in all the work of your hands .
when you harvest your vineyard , you shall not glean it after yourselves : it shall be for the foreigner , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
you shall have a perfect and just weight . you shall have a perfect and just measure , that your days may be long in the land which Yahweh your God gives you .
therefore it shall be , when Yahweh your God has given you rest from all your enemies all around , in the land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it , that you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky ; you shall not forget .
now , behold , I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground , which you , Yahweh , have given me . " you shall set it down before Yahweh your God , and worship before Yahweh your God .
you shall rejoice in all the good which Yahweh your God has given to you , and to your house , you , and the Levite , and the foreigner who is in the midst of you .
look down from your holy habitation , from heaven , and bless your people Israel , and the ground which you have given us , as you swore to our fathers , a land flowing with milk and honey . "
this day Yahweh your God commands you to do these statutes and ordinances : you shall therefore keep and do them with all your heart , and with all your soul .
there you shall build an altar to Yahweh your God , an altar of stones : you shall lift up no iron on them .
you shall build the altar of Yahweh your God of uncut stones ; and you shall offer burnt offerings thereon to Yahweh your God :
and you shall sacrifice peace offerings , and shall eat there ; and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God .
'Cursed is he who lies with his sister , the daughter of his father , or the daughter of his mother . ' all the people shall say , ' Amen . '
'Cursed is he who strikes his neighbor in secret . ' all the people shall say , ' Amen . '
and all these blessings shall come on you , and overtake you , if you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh your God .
you shall be blessed in the fruit of your body , the fruit of your ground , the fruit of your animals , the increase of your livestock , and the young of your flock .
Yahweh will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be struck before you . they will come out against you one way , and will flee before you seven ways .
Yahweh will command the blessing on you in your barns , and in all that you put your hand to ; and he will bless you in the land which Yahweh your God gives you .
but it shall come to pass , if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh your God , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command you this day , that all these curses shall come on you , and overtake you .
Yahweh will make the pestilence cling to you , until he has consumed you from off the land , where you go in to possess it .
the fruit of your ground , and all your labors , shall a nation which you don 't know eat up ; and you shall be only oppressed and crushed always ;
Yahweh will strike you in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore boil , of which you can not be healed , from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head .
Yahweh will bring you , and your king whom you shall set over you , to a nation that you have not known , you nor your fathers ; and there you shall serve other gods , wood and stone .
you shall have olive trees throughout all your borders , but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil ; for your olives shall drop off .
you shall father sons and daughters , but they shall not be yours ; for they shall go into captivity .
all these curses shall come on you , and shall pursue you , and overtake you , until you are destroyed ; because you didn 't listen to the voice of Yahweh your God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded you :
therefore you shall serve your enemies whom Yahweh shall send against you , in hunger , and in thirst , and in nakedness , and in want of all things : and he shall put a yoke of iron on your neck , until he has destroyed you .
you shall eat the fruit of your own body , the flesh of your sons and of your daughters , whom Yahweh your God has given you , in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies shall distress you .
the man who is tender among you , and very delicate , his eye shall be evil toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bosom , and toward the remnant of his children whom he has remaining ;
so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat , because he has nothing left him , in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in all your gates .
among these nations you shall find no ease , and there shall be no rest for the sole of your foot : but Yahweh will give you there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and pining of soul ;
your little ones , your wives , and your foreigner who is in the midst of your camps , from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water ;
it shall happen , when all these things have come on you , the blessing and the curse , which I have set before you , and you shall call them to mind among all the nations , where Yahweh your God has driven you ,
and shall return to Yahweh your God , and shall obey his voice according to all that I command you this day , you and your children , with all your heart , and with all your soul ;
and Yahweh your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed , and you shall possess it ; and he will do you good , and multiply you above your fathers .
it is not in heaven , that you should say , " Who shall go up for us to heaven , and bring it to us , and make us to hear it , that we may do it ? "
but the word is very near to you , in your mouth , and in your heart , that you may do it .
assemble the people , the men and the women and the little ones , and your foreigner who is within your gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear Yahweh your God , and observe to do all the words of this law ;
I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have worked , in that they are turned to other gods .
Yahweh saw and abhorred , because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters .
" see now that I , even I , am he , There is no god with me . I kill , and I make alive . I wound , and I heal . there is no one who can deliver out of my hand .
because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh , in the wilderness of Zin ; because you didn 't sanctify me in the midst of the children of Israel .
for you shall see the land before you ; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the children of Israel . "
yes , he loves the people . all his saints are in your hand . they sat down at your feet ; each receives your words .
of Zebulun he said , " Rejoice , Zebulun , in your going out ; and Issachar , in your tents .
of Asher he said , " Asher is blessed with children . let him be acceptable to his brothers . let him dip his foot in oil .
Israel dwells in safety ; the fountain of Jacob alone , In a land of grain and new wine . yes , his heavens drop down dew .
you are happy , Israel . who is like you , a people saved by Yahweh , the shield of your help , the sword of your excellency ! your enemies shall submit themselves to you . you shall tread on their high places . "
no man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life . as I was with Moses , so I will be with you . I will not fail you nor forsake you .
whoever rebels against your commandment , and doesn 't listen to your words in all that you command him , he shall be put to death . only be strong and courageous . "
as soon as we had heard it , our hearts melted , neither did there remain any more spirit in any man , because of you : for Yahweh your God , he is God in heaven above , and on earth beneath .
at that time , Yahweh said to Joshua , " Make flint knives , and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time . "
he said , " No ; but I have come now as commander of Yahweh 's army . " Joshua fell on his face to the earth , and worshipped , and said to him , " What does my lord say to his servant ? "
Joshua tore his clothes , and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of Yahweh until the evening , he and the elders of Israel ; and they put dust on their heads .
therefore the children of Israel can 't stand before their enemies . they turn their backs before their enemies , because they have become devoted for destruction . I will not be with you any more , unless you destroy the devoted things from among you .
Yahweh said to Joshua , " Don 't be afraid , neither be dismayed . take all the people of war with you , and arise , go up to Ai . behold , I have given into your hand the king of Ai , with his people , his city , and his land .
the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand , and entered into the city , and took it . they hurried and set the city on fire .
for Joshua didn 't draw back his hand , with which he stretched out the javelin , until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai .
only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey to themselves , according to the word of Yahweh which he commanded Joshua .
they also resorted to a ruse , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old sacks on their donkeys , and wineskins , old and torn and bound up ,
Yahweh said to Joshua , " Don 't fear them , for I have delivered them into your hands . not a man of them will stand before you . "
that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace . none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel .
with him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance , which Moses gave them , beyond the Jordan eastward , even as Moses the servant of Yahweh gave them :
nevertheless , my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt ; but I wholly followed Yahweh my God .
Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph , even to Ephraim and to Manasseh , saying , " You are a great people , and have great power . you shall not have one lot only ;
appoint for yourselves three men from each tribe . I will send them , and they shall arise , walk through the land , and describe it according to their inheritance ; and they shall come to me .
they shall divide it into seven portions . Judah shall live in his borders on the south , and the house of Joseph shall live in their borders on the north .
the children of Israel gave to the Levites out of their inheritance , according to the commandment of Yahweh , these cities with their suburbs .
and said to them , " You have kept all that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you , and have listened to my voice in all that I commanded you .
you have not left your brothers these many days to this day , but have performed the duty of the commandment of Yahweh your God .
so Joshua blessed them , and sent them away ; and they went to their tents .
Joshua said to the people , " You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen Yahweh yourselves , to serve him . " they said , " We are witnesses . "
Adoni @-@ Bezek said , " Seventy kings , having their thumbs and their great toes cut off , scavenged under my table : as I have done , so God has requited me . " they brought him to Jerusalem , and he died there .
and they took their daughters to be their wives , and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods .
the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , and forgot Yahweh their God , and served the Baals and the Asheroth .
he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek ; and he went and struck Israel , and they possessed the city of palm trees .
Ehud made him a sword which had two edges , a cubit in length ; and he wore it under his clothing on his right thigh .
but he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal , and said , " I have a secret errand to you , king . " the king said , " Keep silence ! " all who stood by him went out from him .
Ehud came to him ; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room . Ehud said , " I have a message from God to you . " he arose out of his seat .
Ehud put forth his left hand , and took the sword from his right thigh , and thrust it into his body :
she lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim : and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment .
Sisera gathered together all his chariots , even nine hundred chariots of iron , and all the people who were with him , from Harosheth of the Gentiles , to the river Kishon .
'Awake , awake , Deborah ! awake , awake , utter a song ! arise , Barak , and lead away your captives , you son of Abinoam . '
Zebulun was a people that jeopardized their lives to the deaths ; Naphtali also , on the high places of the field .
for they came up with their livestock and their tents ; they came in as locusts for multitude ; both they and their camels were without number : and they came into the land to destroy it .
Yahweh looked at him , and said , " Go in this your might , and save Israel from the hand of Midian . haven 't I sent you ? "
please don 't go away , until I come to you , and bring out my present , and lay it before you . " he said , " I will wait until you come back . "
so he brought down the people to the water ; and Yahweh said to Gideon , " Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue , like a dog laps , you shall set him by himself ; likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink . "
so the people took food in their hand , and their trumpets ; and he sent all the men of Israel every man to his tent , but retained the three hundred men : and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley .
he came to the men of Succoth , and said , " See Zebah and Zalmunna , concerning whom you taunted me , saying , ' Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand , that we should give bread to your men who are weary ? ' "
so Midian was subdued before the children of Israel , and they lifted up their heads no more . the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon .
he went to his father 's house at Ophrah , and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal , being seventy persons , on one stone : but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left ; for he hid himself .
when they told it to Jotham , he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim , and lifted up his voice , and cried , and said to them , " Listen to me , you men of Shechem , that God may listen to you .
" the bramble said to the trees , ' If in truth you anoint me king over you , then come and take refuge in my shade ; and if not , let fire come out of the bramble , and devour the cedars of Lebanon . '
that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come , and that their blood might be laid on Abimelech their brother , who killed them , and on the men of Shechem , who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers .
Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers , and went over to Shechem ; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him .
he sent messengers to Abimelech craftily , saying , " Behold , Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem ; and behold , they incite the city against you .
they put away the foreign gods from among them , and served Yahweh ; and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel .
then Jephthah fled from his brothers , and lived in the land of Tob : and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah , and they went out with him .
the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah , " Yahweh shall be witness between us ; surely according to your word so will we do . "
then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead , and the people made him head and chief over them : and Jephthah spoke all his words before Yahweh in Mizpah .
but Sihon didn 't trust Israel to pass through his border ; but Sihon gathered all his people together , and encamped in Jahaz , and fought against Israel .
Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house ; and behold , his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances : and she was his only child ; besides her he had neither son nor daughter .
he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , " I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines : now therefore get her for me as wife . "
then went Samson down , and his father and his mother , to Timnah , and came to the vineyards of Timnah : and behold , a young lion roared against him .
the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him , and he tore him as he would have torn a young goat ; and he had nothing in his hand : but he didn 't tell his father or his mother what he had done .
he took it into his hands , and went on , eating as he went ; and he came to his father and mother , and gave to them , and they ate : but he didn 't tell them that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion .
he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey , and put forth his hand , and took it , and struck a thousand men therewith .
he was very thirsty , and called on Yahweh , and said , " You have given this great deliverance by the hand of your servant ; and now shall I die for thirst , and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised ? "
the man Micah had a house of gods , and he made an ephod , and teraphim , and consecrated one of his sons , who became his priest .
they came to their brothers to Zorah and Eshtaol : and their brothers said to them , " What do you say ? "
he said , " You have taken away my gods which I made , and the priest , and have gone away , and what more do I have ? how then do you say to me , ' What ails you ? ' "
the children of Dan went their way : and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him , he turned and went back to his house .
the children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image : and Jonathan , the son of Gershom , the son of Moses , he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land .
so they set them up Micah 's engraved image which he made , all the time that God 's house was in Shiloh .
behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening : now the man was of the hill country of Ephraim , and he lived in Gibeah ; but the men of the place were Benjamites .
yet there is both straw and provender for our donkeys ; and there is bread and wine also for me , and for your handmaid , and for the young man who is with your servants : there is no want of anything . "
so he brought him into his house , and gave the donkeys fodder ; and they washed their feet , and ate and drink .
all the people arose as one man , saying , " None of us will go to his tent , neither will any of us turn to his house .
the children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother , and said , " There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day .
the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wives , according to their number , of those who danced , whom they carried off . they went and returned to their inheritance , built the cities , and lived in them .
the children of Israel departed there at that time , every man to his tribe and to his family , and they went out from there every man to his inheritance .
Naomi said to her two daughters @-@ in @-@ law , " Go , return each of you to her mother 's house : Yahweh deal kindly with you , as you have dealt with the dead , and with me .
she said , " Behold , your sister @-@ in @-@ law has gone back to her people , and to her god . follow your sister @-@ in @-@ law . "
then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers , " Whose young lady is this ? "
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said to him , " Why have I found favor in your sight , that you should take knowledge of me , since I am a foreigner ? "
then she said , " Let me find favor in your sight , my lord , because you have comforted me , and because you have spoken kindly to your handmaid , though I am not as one of your handmaidens . "
she took it up , and went into the city ; and her mother @-@ in @-@ law saw what she had gleaned : and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed .
therefore wash yourself , anoint yourself , get dressed , and go down to the threshing floor , but don 't make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking .
she said , " He gave me these six measures of barley ; for he said , ' Don 't go empty to your mother @-@ in @-@ law . ' "
the near kinsman said , " I can 't redeem it for myself , lest I mar my own inheritance . take my right of redemption for yourself ; for I can 't redeem it . "
now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging , to confirm all things : a man took off his shoe , and gave it to his neighbor ; and this was the way of attestation in Israel .
so the near kinsman said to Boaz , " Buy it for yourself . " he took off his shoe .
this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Yahweh of Armies in Shiloh . the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , priests to Yahweh , were there .
Elkanah her husband said to her , " Hannah , why do you weep ? why don 't you eat ? why is your heart grieved ? am I not better to you than ten sons ? "
now Hannah spoke in her heart . only her lips moved , but her voice was not heard . therefore Eli thought she had been drunken .
Don 't count your handmaid for a wicked woman ; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation . "
she said , " Let your handmaid find favor in your sight . " so the woman went her way , and ate ; and her facial expression wasn 't sad any more .

Samuel answered Saul , and said , " I am the seer . go up before me to the high place , for you shall eat with me today . in the morning I will let you go , and will tell you all that is in your heart .
Samuel said to the cook , " Bring the portion which I gave you , of which I said to you , ' Set it aside . ' "
Saul said to his uncle , " He told us plainly that the donkeys were found . " but concerning the matter of the kingdom , of which Samuel spoke , he didn 't tell him .
they ran and fetched him there ; and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward .

there was severe war against the Philistines all the days of Saul : and when Saul saw any mighty man , or any valiant man , he took him to him .
Saul said , " They have brought them from the Amalekites ; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the cattle , to sacrifice to Yahweh your God . we have utterly destroyed the rest . "
Samuel said , " Though you were little in your own sight , weren 't you made the head of the tribes of Israel ? Yahweh anointed you king over Israel ;
then he said , " I have sinned : yet please honor me now before the elders of my people , and before Israel , and come back with me , that I may worship Yahweh your God . "

David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage , and ran to the army , and came and greeted his brothers .
David said to Saul , " Your servant was keeping his father 's sheep ; and when a lion or a bear came , and took a lamb out of the flock ,
David put his hand in his bag , took a stone , and slung it , and struck the Philistine in his forehead ; and the stone sank into his forehead , and he fell on his face to the earth .
David took the head of the Philistine , and brought it to Jerusalem ; but he put his armor in his tent .
Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him , and gave it to David , and his clothing , even to his sword , and to his bow , and to his sash .
therefore Saul removed him from him , and made him his captain over a thousand ; and he went out and came in before the people .
I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are , and I will talk with my father about you ; and if I see anything , I will tell you . "
Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father , and said to him , " Don 't let the king sin against his servant , against David ; because he has not sinned against you , and because his works have been very good toward you ;
Saul sent messengers to David 's house , to watch him , and to kill him in the morning . Michal , David 's wife , told him , saying , " If you don 't save your life tonight , tomorrow you will be killed . "
Saul said to Michal , " Why have you deceived me thus , and let my enemy go , so that he is escaped ? " Michal answered Saul , " He said to me , ' Let me go ! why should I kill you ? ' "
he also stripped off his clothes , and he also prophesied before Samuel , and lay down naked all that day and all that night . therefore they say , " Is Saul also among the prophets ? "
David fled from Naioth in Ramah , and came and said before Jonathan , " What have I done ? what is my iniquity ? what is my sin before your father , that he seeks my life ? "
then Jonathan said to David , " Whatever your soul desires , I will even do it for you . "

when the boy had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot , Jonathan cried after the boy , and said , " isn 't the arrow beyond you ? "

David said to Ahimelech , " isn 't there here under your hand spear or sword ? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me , because the king 's business required haste . "
David laid up these words in his heart , and was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath .
then Achish said to his servants , " Look , you see the man is mad . why then have you brought him to me ?
Saul said to his servants who stood about him , " Hear now , you Benjamites ! will the son of Jesse give everyone of you fields and vineyards , will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds ,
it happened , when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah , that he came down with an ephod in his hand .

swear now therefore to me by Yahweh , that you will not cut off my seed after me , and that you will not destroy my name out of my father 's house . "
David swore to Saul . Saul went home ; but David and his men went up to the stronghold .

blessed is your discretion , and blessed are you , that have kept me this day from blood guiltiness , and from avenging myself with my own hand .
Yahweh will render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness ; because Yahweh delivered you into my hand today , and I wouldn 't put forth my hand against Yahweh 's anointed .
behold , as your life was respected this day in my eyes , so let my life be respected in the eyes of Yahweh , and let him deliver me out of all oppression . "
it happened in those days , that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare , to fight with Israel . Achish said to David , " Know assuredly that you shall go out with me in the army , you and your men . "
David said to Achish , " Therefore you shall know what your servant will do . " Achish said to David , " Therefore will I make you my bodyguard for ever . "
Yahweh has done to you as he spoke by me . Yahweh has torn the kingdom out of your hand , and given it to your neighbor , even to David .
now therefore , please listen also to the voice of your handmaid , and let me set a morsel of bread before you ; and eat , that you may have strength , when you go on your way . "
now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek : and the Israelites encamped by the spring which is in Jezreel .
David said to Abiathar the priest , the son of Ahimelech , " Please bring me here the ephod . " Abiathar brought the ephod to David .
they cut off his head , and stripped off his armor , and sent into the land of the Philistines all around , to carry the news to the house of their idols , and to the people .
then David took hold on his clothes , and tore them ; and likewise all the men who were with him .

David said to Michal , " It was before Yahweh , who chose me above your father , and above all his house , to appoint me prince over the people of Yahweh , over Israel . therefore will I celebrate before Yahweh .
and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel . I will cause you to rest from all your enemies . moreover Yahweh tells you that Yahweh will make you a house .
when your days are fulfilled , and you shall sleep with your fathers , I will set up your seed after you , who shall proceed out of your bowels , and I will establish his kingdom .

the king of Syria said , " Go now , and I will send a letter to the king of Israel . " he departed , and took with him ten talents of silver , and six thousand pieces of gold , and ten changes of clothing .
it was so , when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes , that he sent to the king , saying , " Why have you torn your clothes ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel . "
Elisha sent a messenger to him , saying , " Go and wash in the Jordan seven times , and your flesh shall come again to you , and you shall be clean . "
but Naaman was angry , and went away , and said , " Behold , I thought , ' He will surely come out to me , and stand , and call on the name of Yahweh his God , and wave his hand over the place , and heal the leper . '
so Gehazi followed after Naaman . when Naaman saw one running after him , he came down from the chariot to meet him , and said , " Is all well ? "
but he went in , and stood before his master . Elisha said to him , " Where did you come from , Gehazi ? " he said , " Your servant went nowhere . "
he said , " Take it . " so he put out his hand and took it .
the heart of the king of Syria was very troubled about this . he called his servants , and said to them , " Won 't you show me which of us is for the king of Israel ? "
it happened after this , that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his army , and went up and besieged Samaria .
therefore they arose and fled in the twilight , and left their tents , and their horses , and their donkeys , even the camp as it was , and fled for their life .
they went after them to the Jordan ; and behold , all the way was full of garments and vessels , which the Syrians had cast away in their haste . the messengers returned , and told the king .
then Joram passed over to Zair , and all his chariots with him : and he rose up by night , and struck the Edomites who surrounded him , and the captains of the chariots ; and the people fled to their tents .
Joram slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David ; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place .
Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets , and said to him , " Put your belt on your waist , take this vial of oil in your hand , and go to Ramoth Gilead .
when he came , behold , the captains of the army were sitting . then he said , " I have a message for you , captain . " Jehu said , " To which of us all ? " he said , " To you , O captain . "
Jehu drew his bow with his full strength , and struck Joram between his arms ; and the arrow went out at his heart , and he sunk down in his chariot .
when Jehu had come to Jezreel , Jezebel heard of it ; and she painted her eyes , and attired her head , and looked out at the window .
he lifted up his face to the window , and said , " Who is on my side ? who ? " two or three eunuchs looked out at him .
select the best and fittest of your master 's sons , set him on his father 's throne , and fight for your master 's house . "
in the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the captains over hundreds of the Carites and of the guard , and brought them to him into the house of Yahweh ; and he made a covenant with them , and took an oath of them in the house of Yahweh , and showed them the king 's son .
the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the altar and the house , around the king .
Jehoash did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh all his days in which Jehoiada the priest instructed him .
( Yahweh gave Israel a savior , so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians ; and the children of Israel lived in their tents as before .
he said to the king of Israel , " Put your hand on the bow " ; and he put his hand on it . Elisha laid his hands on the king 's hands .
but Yahweh was gracious to them , and had compassion on them , and had respect to them , because of his covenant with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and would not destroy them , neither cast he them from his presence as yet .
it happened , as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand , that he killed his servants who had slain the king his father :
Judah was defeated by Israel ; and they fled every man to his tent .
he built Elath , and restored it to Judah , after that the king slept with his fathers .
Jeroboam slept with his fathers , even with the kings of Israel ; and Zechariah his son reigned in his place .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh : he didn 't depart all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , with which he made Israel to sin .
Pekah the son of Remaliah , his captain , conspired against him , and struck him in Samaria , in the castle of the king 's house , with Argob and Arieh ; and with him were fifty men of the Gileadites : and he killed him , and reigned in his place .
Jotham slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father : and Ahaz his son reigned in his place .
he burnt his burnt offering and his meal offering , and poured his drink offering , and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings , on the altar .
it was so , because the children of Israel had sinned against Yahweh their God , who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt , and had feared other gods ,
the children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against Yahweh their God : and they built them high places in all their cities , from the tower of the watchmen to the fortified city ;
and they set them up pillars and Asherim on every high hill , and under every green tree ;
notwithstanding , they would not listen , but hardened their neck , like the neck of their fathers , who didn 't believe in Yahweh their God .
they forsook all the commandments of Yahweh their God , and made them molten images , even two calves , and made an Asherah , and worshiped all the army of the sky , and served Baal .
they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire , and used divination and enchantments , and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh , to provoke him to anger .
therefore Yahweh was very angry with Israel , and removed them out of his sight : there was none left but the tribe of Judah only .
until Yahweh removed Israel out of his sight , as he spoke by all his servants the prophets . so Israel was carried away out of their own land to Assyria to this day .
and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak ; and the Sepharvites burnt their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech , the gods of Sepharvaim .
so they feared Yahweh , and made to them from among themselves priests of the high places , who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places .
then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , and Shebnah , and Joah , said to Rabshakeh , " Please speak to your servants in the Syrian language ; for we understand it . Don 't speak with us in the Jews ' language , in the hearing of the people who are on the wall . "
Don 't listen to Hezekiah . ' for thus says the king of Assyria , ' Make your peace with me , and come out to me ; and everyone of you eat of his vine , and everyone of his fig tree , and everyone drink the waters of his own cistern ;
who are they among all the gods of the countries , that have delivered their country out of my hand , that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand ? ' "
it happened , when king Hezekiah heard it , that he tore his clothes , and covered himself with sackcloth , and went into the house of Yahweh .
this is the word that Yahweh has spoken concerning him : " the virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and ridiculed you . the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you .
'For I will defend this city to save it , for my own sake , and for my servant David 's sake . ' "
then he turned his face to the wall , and prayed to Yahweh , saying ,
" turn back , and tell Hezekiah the prince of my people , ' Thus says Yahweh , the God of David your father , " I have heard your prayer . I have seen your tears . behold , I will heal you . on the third day , you shall go up to the house of Yahweh .
I will add to your days fifteen years . I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria . I will defend this city for my own sake , and for my servant David 's sake . " ' "
he said , " What have they seen in your house ? " Hezekiah answered , " They have seen all that is in my house . there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them . "
" because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations , and has done wickedly above all that the Amorites did , who were before him , and has made Judah also to sin with his idols ;
he defiled Topheth , which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom , that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech .
for through the anger of Yahweh , it happened in Jerusalem and Judah , until he had cast them out from his presence . Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
it happened in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came , he and all his army , against Jerusalem , and encamped against it ; and they built forts against it around it .
they trespassed against the God of their fathers , and played the prostitute after the gods of the peoples of the land , whom God destroyed before them .
they ministered with song before the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting , until Solomon had built the house of Yahweh in Jerusalem : and they waited on their office according to their order .
so all Israel were reckoned by genealogies ; and behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel : and Judah was carried away captive to Babylon for their disobedience .
now the first inhabitants who lived in their possessions in their cities were Israel , the priests , the Levites , and the Nethinim .
and their brothers , heads of their fathers ' houses , one thousand seven hundred sixty ; very able men for the work of the service of God 's house .
their brothers , in their villages , were to come in every seven days from time to time to be with them :
these are the singers , heads of fathers ' households of the Levites , who lived in the rooms and were free from other service ; for they were employed in their work day and night .
when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , they forsook their cities , and fled ; and the Philistines came and lived in them .
Abishai , the brother of Joab , he was chief of the three ; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
and let us bring again the ark of our God to us . for we didn 't seek it in the days of Saul . "
when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon , Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark ; for the oxen stumbled .
the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Uzza , and he struck him , because he put forth his hand to the ark ; and there he died before God .
so they came up to Baal Perazim , and David struck them there ; and David said , God has broken my enemies by my hand , like the breach of waters . therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim .
they left their gods there ; and David gave commandment , and they were burned with fire .
it happened , as the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came to the city of David , that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window , and saw king David dancing and playing ; and she despised him in her heart .
" Don 't touch my anointed ones ! do my prophets no harm ! "
it shall happen , when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers , that I will set up your seed after you , who shall be of your sons ; and I will establish his kingdom .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . I will not take my loving kindness away from him , as I took it from him that was before you ;
this was a small thing in your eyes , God ; but you have spoken of your servant 's house for a great while to come , and have respected me according to the estate of a man of high degree , Yahweh God .
Yahweh , for your servant 's sake , and according to your own heart , you have worked all this greatness , to make known all these great things .
Yahweh , there is none like you , neither is there any God besides you , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
David struck Hadadezer king of Zobah to Hamath , as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates .
so they hired for themselves thirty @-@ two thousand chariots , and the king of Maacah and his people , who came and encamped before Medeba . the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities , and came to battle .
so Gad came to David , and said to him , " Thus says Yahweh , ' Take your choice :
David lifted up his eyes , and saw the angel of Yahweh standing between earth and the sky , having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem . then David and the elders , clothed in sackcloth , fell on their faces .
Eleazar died , and had no sons , but daughters only : and their brothers the sons of Kish took them as wives .
of all my sons ( for Yahweh has given me many sons ) , he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of Yahweh 's kingdom over Israel .
yours , Yahweh , is the greatness , the power , the glory , the victory , and the majesty ! for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours . yours is the kingdom , Yahweh , and you are exalted as head above all .
but who am I , and what is my people , that we should be able to offer so willingly as this ? for all things come from you , and of your own have we given you .
Yahweh our God , all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your hand , and is all your own .
and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep your commandments , your testimonies , and your statutes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for which I have made provision . "
David said to all the assembly , " Now bless Yahweh your God ! " all the assembly blessed Yahweh , the God of their fathers , and bowed down their heads and prostrated themselves before Yahweh and the king .
wisdom and knowledge is granted to you . I will give you riches , wealth , and honor , such as none of the kings have had who have been before you ; neither shall there any after you have the like . "
then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing , which he sent to Solomon , " Because Yahweh loves his people , he has made you king over them . "
Huram continued , " Blessed be Yahweh , the God of Israel , that made heaven and earth , who has given to David the king a wise son , endowed with discretion and understanding , that should build a house for Yahweh , and a house for his kingdom .
" now therefore the wheat and the barley , the oil and the wine , which my lord has spoken of , let him send to his servants :
the wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits : and they stood on their feet , and their faces were toward the house .
the king turned his face , and blessed all the assembly of Israel : and all the assembly of Israel stood .
but Yahweh said to David my father , ' Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name , you did well that it was in your heart :
( for Solomon had made a bronze scaffold , five cubits long , and five cubits broad , and three cubits high , and had set it in the midst of the court ; and on it he stood , and kneeled down on his knees before all the assembly of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heaven ; )
and he said , " Yahweh , the God of Israel , there is no God like you , in heaven , or on earth ; you who keep covenant and loving kindness with your servants , who walk before you with all their heart ;
" when the sky is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sinned against you ; if they pray toward this place , and confess your name , and turn from their sin , when you afflict them :
" moreover concerning the foreigner , who is not of your people Israel , when he shall come from a far country for your great name 's sake , and your mighty hand , and your outstretched arm ; when they shall come and pray toward this house :
" if your people go out to battle against their enemies , by whatever way you shall send them , and they pray to you toward this city which you have chosen , and the house which I have built for your name ;
then hear from heaven , even from your dwelling place , their prayer and their petitions , and maintain their cause , and forgive your people who have sinned against you .
" as for you , if you will walk before me as David your father walked , and do according to all that I have commanded you , and will keep my statutes and my ordinances ;
then I will pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have made holy for my name , I will cast out of my sight , and I will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples .
she said to the king , " It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts , and of your wisdom .
happy are your men , and happy are these your servants , who stand continually before you , and hear your wisdom .
King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire , whatever she asked , besides that which she had brought to the king . so she turned , and went to her own land , she and her servants .
they brought every man his tribute , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and clothing , armor , and spices , horses , and mules , a rate year by year .
'Thus says Yahweh , " You shall not go up , nor fight against your brothers ! return every man to his house ; for this thing is of me . " ' " so they listened to the words of Yahweh , and returned from going against Jeroboam .
for the Levites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to Judah and Jerusalem : for Jeroboam and his sons cast them off , that they should not execute the priest 's office to Yahweh ;
Rehoboam loved Maacah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines : ( for he took eighteen wives , and sixty concubines , and became the father of twenty @-@ eight sons and sixty daughters . )
he did that which was evil , because he didn 't set his heart to seek Yahweh .
thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time , and the children of Judah prevailed , because they relied on Yahweh , the God of their fathers .
and commanded Judah to seek Yahweh , the God of their fathers , and to do the law and the commandment .
but when in their distress they turned to Yahweh , the God of Israel , and sought him , he was found by them .
they entered into the covenant to seek Yahweh , the God of their fathers , with all their heart and with all their soul ;
it happened , when Baasha heard of it , that he left off building Ramah , and let his work cease .
weren 't the Ethiopians and the Lubim a huge army , with chariots and horsemen exceeding many ? yet , because you relied on Yahweh , he delivered them into your hand .
but sought to the God of his father , and walked in his commandments , and not after the doings of Israel .
they taught in Judah , having the book of the law of Yahweh with them ; and they went about throughout all the cities of Judah , and taught among the people .
he said , " I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains , as sheep that have no shepherd . Yahweh said , ' These have no master . let them return every man to his house in peace . ' "
" now therefore , behold , Yahweh has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets ; and Yahweh has spoken evil concerning you . "
the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat , " I will disguise myself , and go into the battle ; but you put on your robes . " so the king of Israel disguised himself ; and they went into the battle .
Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem .
nevertheless there are good things found in you , in that you have put away the Asheroth out of the land , and have set your heart to seek God . "
however the high places were not taken away ; neither as yet had the people set their hearts to the God of their fathers .
Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David : and Jehoram his son reigned in his place .
so Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah to this day : then Libnah revolted at the same time from under his hand , because he had forsaken Yahweh , the God of his fathers .
behold , Yahweh will strike with a great plague your people , and your children , and your wives , and all your substance ;
Jehoiada made a covenant between himself , and all the people , and the king , that they should be Yahweh 's people .
they forsook the house of Yahweh , the God of their fathers , and served the Asherim and the idols : and wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem for this their guiltiness .
now it happened , when the kingdom was established to him , that he killed his servants who had killed the king his father .
therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Amaziah , and he sent to him a prophet , who said to him , " Why have you sought after the gods of the people , which have not delivered their own people out of your hand ? "
but when he was strong , his heart was lifted up , so that he did corruptly , and he trespassed against Yahweh his God ; for he went into Yahweh 's temple to burn incense on the altar of incense .
moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom , and burnt his children in the fire , according to the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel .
for Pekah the son of Remaliah killed in Judah one hundred twenty thousand in one day , all of them valiant men ; because they had forsaken Yahweh , the God of their fathers .
the children of Israel carried away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand , women , sons , and daughters , and took also away much spoil from them , and brought the spoil to Samaria .
now you purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondservants and bondmaids for yourselves . aren 't there even with you trespasses of your own against Yahweh your God ?
in the time of his distress , he trespassed yet more against Yahweh , this same king Ahaz .
in every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods , and provoked to anger Yahweh , the God of his fathers .
they stood in their place after their order , according to the law of Moses the man of God : the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites .
in every work that he began in the service of God 's house , and in the law , and in the commandments , to seek his God , he did it with all his heart , and prospered .
after these things , and this faithfulness , Sennacherib king of Assyria came , and entered into Judah , and encamped against the fortified cities , and thought to win them for himself .
he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the springs which were outside of the city ; and they helped him .
he set captains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city , and spoke comfortably to them , saying ,
Don 't you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands ? were the gods of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand ?
who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of my hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand ?
notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of Yahweh didn 't come on them in the days of Hezekiah .
Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor : and he provided him treasuries for silver , and for gold , and for precious stones , and for spices , and for shields , and for all kinds of goodly vessels ;
this same Hezekiah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gihon , and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David . Hezekiah prospered in all his works .
when he was in distress , he begged Yahweh his God , and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers .
nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places , but only to Yahweh their God .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh , and walked in the ways of David his father , and didn 't turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
for in the eighth year of his reign , while he was yet young , he began to seek after the God of David his father ; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places , and the Asherim , and the engraved images , and the molten images .
so the service was prepared , and the priests stood in their place , and the Levites by their divisions , according to the king 's commandment .
afterward they prepared for themselves , and for the priests , because the priests the sons of Aaron were busy with offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night : therefore the Levites prepared for themselves , and for the priests the sons of Aaron .
Jeremiah lamented for Josiah : and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day ; and they made them an ordinance in Israel : and behold , they are written in the lamentations .
Jehoiakim was twenty @-@ five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh his God .
he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar , who had made him swear by God : but he stiffened his neck , and hardened his heart against turning to Yahweh , the God of Israel .
all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred . Sheshbazzar brought all these up , when the captives were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem .
these were those who went up from Tel Melah , Tel Harsha , cherub , Addan , and Immer ; but they could not show their fathers ' houses , and their seed , whether they were of Israel :
so the priests , and the Levites , and some of the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinim , lived in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers : so you shall find in the book of the records , and know that this city is a rebellious city , and hurtful to kings and provinces , and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time ; for which cause was this city laid waste .
for the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together ; all of them were pure : and they killed the Passover for all the children of the captivity , and for their brothers the priests , and for themselves .
for Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of Yahweh , and to do it , and to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances .
whatever shall seem good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , do that after the will of your God .
then I proclaimed a fast there , at the river Ahava , that we might humble ourselves before our God , to seek of him a straight way for us , and for our little ones , and for all our substance .
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons , so that the holy seed have mixed themselves with the peoples of the lands . yes , the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this trespass . "
at the evening offering I arose up from my humiliation , even with my garment and my robe torn ; and I fell on my knees , and spread out my hands to Yahweh my God ;
and I said , " My God , I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to you , my God ; for our iniquities have increased over our head , and our guiltiness has grown up to the heavens .
shall we again break your commandments , and join in affinity with the peoples that do these abominations ? wouldn 't you be angry with us until you had consumed us , so that there should be no remnant , nor any to escape ?
they gave their hand that they would put away their wives ; and being guilty , they offered a ram of the flock for their guilt .
all these had taken foreign wives ; and some of them had wives by whom they had children .
that Hanani , one of my brothers , came , he and certain men out of Judah ; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped , who were left of the captivity , and concerning Jerusalem .
I said to the king , " Let the king live forever ! why shouldn 't my face be sad , when the city , the place of my fathers ' tombs , lies waste , and its gates have been consumed with fire ? "
I told them of the hand of my God which was good on me , as also of the king 's words that he had spoken to me . they said , " Let 's rise up and build . " so they strengthened their hands for the good work .
next to them , the Tekoites made repairs ; but their nobles didn 't put their necks to the work of their lord .
and the builders , everyone wore his sword at his side , and so built . he who sounded the trumpet was by me .
likewise at the same time said I to the people , " Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem , that in the night they may be a guard to us , and may labor in the day . "
some also there were that said , " We are mortgaging our fields , and our vineyards , and our houses . let us get grain , because of the famine . "
it happened , when all our enemies heard of it , that all the nations that were about us were afraid , and were much cast down in their own eyes ; for they perceived that this work was worked of our God .
for there were many in Judah sworn to him , because he was the son @-@ in @-@ law of Shecaniah the son of Arah ; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as wife .
and Ezra blessed Yahweh , the great God . all the people answered , " Amen , Amen , " with the lifting up of their hands . they bowed their heads , and worshiped Yahweh with their faces to the ground .
so the people went out , and brought them , and made themselves booths , everyone on the roof of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of God 's house , and in the broad place of the water gate , and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim .
the seed of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners , and stood and confessed their sins , and the iniquities of their fathers .
you gave also your good Spirit to instruct them , and didn 't withhold your manna from their mouth , and gave them water for their thirst .
" nevertheless they were disobedient , and rebelled against you , and cast your law behind their back , and killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you , and they committed awful blasphemies .
and that we would not give our daughters to the peoples of the land , nor take their daughters for our sons ;
also we made ordinances for ourselves , to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God ;
now these are the chiefs of the province who lived in Jerusalem ; but in the cities of Judah everyone lived in his possession in their cities : Israel , the priests , and the Levites , and the Nethinim , and the children of Solomon 's servants .
of the Levites , certain divisions in Judah settled in Benjamin 's territory .
remember me , my God , concerning this , and don 't wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God , and for its observances .
one of the sons of Joiada , the son of Eliashib the high priest , was son @-@ in @-@ law to Sanballat the Horonite : therefore I chased him from me .
that in those days , when the King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom , which was in Shushan the palace ,
in the third year of his reign , he made a feast for all his princes and his servants ; the power of Persia and Media , the nobles and princes of the provinces , being before him .
he displayed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days , even one hundred eighty days .
when these days were fulfilled , the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in Shushan the palace , both great and small , in the court of the garden of the king 's palace .
for this deed of the queen will become known to all women , causing them to show contempt for their husbands , when it is reported , ' King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him , but she didn 't come . '
when the king 's decree which he shall make is published throughout all his kingdom ( for it is great ) , all the wives will give their husbands honor , both great and small . "
now when Mordecai found out all that was done , Mordecai tore his clothes , and put on sackcloth with ashes , and went out into the midst of the city , and wailed loudly and a bitterly .
Esther 's maidens and her eunuchs came and told her this , and the queen was exceedingly grieved . she sent clothing to Mordecai , to replace his sackcloth ; but he didn 't receive it .
nevertheless Haman restrained himself , and went home . there , he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh his wife .
Haman recounted to them the glory of his riches , the multitude of his children , all the things in which the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
so Haman came in . the king said to him , " What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor ? " now Haman said in his heart , " Who would the king delight to honor more than myself ? "
Mordecai came back to the king 's gate , but Haman hurried to his house , mourning and having his head covered .
then Esther the queen answered , " If I have found favor in your sight , O king , and if it please the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request .
the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden . Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen ; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king .
the king took off his ring , which he had taken from Haman , and gave it to Mordecai . Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman .
for how can I endure to see the evil that would come to my people ? how can I endure to see the destruction of my relatives ? "
then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew , " See , I have given Esther the house of Haman , and him they have hanged on the gallows , because he laid his hand on the Jews .
a copy of the letter , that the decree should be given out in every province , was published to all the peoples , that the Jews should be ready for that day to avenge themselves on their enemies .
the Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword , and with slaughter and destruction , and did what they wanted to those who hated them .
to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month Adar yearly ,
to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times , as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had decreed , and as they had imposed upon themselves and their descendants , in the matter of the fastings and their cry .
while he was still speaking , there came also another , and said , " Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother 's house ,
then Job arose , and tore his robe , and shaved his head , and fell down on the ground , and worshiped .
he took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with , and he sat among the ashes .
when they lifted up their eyes from a distance , and didn 't recognize him , they raised their voices , and wept ; and they each tore his robe , and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the sky .
because it didn 't shut up the doors of my mother 's womb , nor did it hide trouble from my eyes .
with kings and counselors of the earth , who built up waste places for themselves ;
but now it has come to you , and you faint . it touches you , and you are troubled .
isn 't your piety your confidence ? isn 't the integrity of your ways your hope ?
behold , he puts no trust in his servants . he charges his angels with error .
so the poor has hope , and injustice shuts her mouth .
you shall know that your tent is in peace . you shall visit your fold , and shall miss nothing .
look this , we have searched it , so it is . hear it , and know it for your good . "
in the dry season , they vanish . when it is hot , they are consumed out of their place .
as a servant who earnestly desires the shadow , as a hireling who looks for his wages ,
so that my soul chooses strangling , death rather than my bones .
if I have sinned , what do I do to you , you watcher of men ? why have you set me as a mark for you , so that I am a burden to myself ?
" how long will you speak these things ? shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind ?
while it is yet in its greenness , not cut down , it withers before any other reed .
he will still fill your mouth with laughter , your lips with shouting .
he removes the mountains , and they don 't know it , when he overturns them in his anger .
though I were righteous , yet I wouldn 't answer him . I would make supplication to my judge .
though I am righteous , my own mouth shall condemn me . though I am blameless , it shall prove me perverse .
I am afraid of all my sorrows , I know that you will not hold me innocent .
there is no umpire between us , that might lay his hand on us both .
then I would speak , and not fear him , for I am not so in myself .
is it good to you that you should oppress , that you should despise the work of your hands , and smile on the counsel of the wicked ?
yet you hid these things in your heart . I know that this is with you :
if I am wicked , woe to me . if I am righteous , I still shall not lift up my head , being filled with disgrace , and conscious of my affliction .
if iniquity is in your hand , put it far away . Don 't let unrighteousness dwell in your tents .
I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor , I , who called on God , and he answered . the just , the blameless man is a joke .
the tents of robbers prosper . those who provoke God are secure , who carry their God in their hands .
" only don 't do two things to me ; then I will not hide myself from your face :
for you write bitter things against me , and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth :
seeing his days are determined , the number of his months is with you , and you have appointed his bounds that he can 't pass ;
you would call , and I would answer you . you would have a desire to the work of your hands .
but now you number my steps . Don 't you watch over my sin ?
your own mouth condemns you , and not I. Yes , your own lips testify against you .
have you heard the secret counsel of God ? do you limit wisdom to yourself ?
that you turn your spirit against God , and let such words go out of your mouth ?
behold , he puts no trust in his holy ones . yes , the heavens are not clean in his sight ;
( which wise men have told by their fathers , and have not hidden it ;
because he has stretched out his hand against God , and behaves himself proudly against the Almighty ;
he runs at him with a stiff neck , with the thick shields of his bucklers ;
because he has covered his face with his fatness , and gathered fat on his thighs .
he shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine , and shall cast off his flower as the olive tree .
I also could speak as you do . if your soul were in my soul 's place , I could join words together against you , and shake my head at you ,
they have gaped on me with their mouth . they have struck me on the cheek reproachfully . they gather themselves together against me .
that he would maintain the right of a man with God , of a son of man with his neighbor !
he who denounces his friends for a prey , Even the eyes of his children shall fail .
you who tear yourself in your anger , shall the earth be forsaken for you ? or shall the rock be removed out of its place ?
my bones stick to my skin and to my flesh . I have escaped by the skin of my teeth .
yet his food in his bowels is turned . it is cobra venom within him .
" because he knew no quietness within him , he shall not save anything of that in which he delights .
they spend their days in prosperity . in an instant they go down to Sheol .
for what does he care for his house after him , when the number of his months is cut off ?
therefore snares are around you . sudden fear troubles you ,
the Almighty will be your treasure , and precious silver to you .
you shall make your prayer to him , and he will hear you . you shall pay your vows .
you shall also decree a thing , and it shall be established to you . light shall shine on your ways .
" even today my complaint is rebellious . his hand is heavy in spite of my groaning .
in the dark they dig through houses . they shut themselves up in the daytime . they don 't know the light .
" dominion and fear are with him . he makes peace in his high places .
job again took up his parable , and said ,
he builds his house as the moth , as a booth which the watchman makes .
job again took up his parable , and said ,
the princes refrained from talking , and laid their hand on their mouth .
then I said , ' I shall die in my own house , I shall number my days as the sand .
my root is spread out to the waters . the dew lies all night on my branch .
after my words they didn 't speak again . my speech fell on them .
they abhor me , they stand aloof from me , and don 't hesitate to spit in my face .
for he has untied his cord , and afflicted me ; and they have thrown off restraint before me .
" however doesn 't one stretch out a hand in his fall ? or in his calamity therefore cry for help ?
if his heart hasn 't blessed me , if he hasn 't been warmed with my sheep 's fleece ;
I said , ' Days should speak , and multitude of years should teach wisdom . '
behold , my terror shall not make you afraid , neither shall my pressure be heavy on you .
he is chastened also with pain on his bed , with continual strife in his bones ;
his flesh shall be fresher than a child 's . he returns to the days of his youth .
" if now you have understanding , hear this . listen to the voice of my words .
shall his recompense be as you desire , that you refuse it ? for you must choose , and not I. Therefore speak what you know .
if they listen and serve him , they shall spend their days in prosperity , and their years in pleasures .
and said , ' Here you may come , but no further . here your proud waves shall be stayed ? '
she deals harshly with her young ones , as if they were not hers . though her labor is in vain , she is without fear ,
is it at your command that the eagle mounts up , and makes his nest on high ?
will you even annul my judgment ? will you condemn me , that you may be justified ?
" now deck yourself with excellency and dignity . array yourself with honor and majesty .
" can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook , or press down his tongue with a cord ?
will he make a covenant with you , that you should take him for a servant forever ?
lay your hand on him . remember the battle , and do so no more .
the flakes of his flesh are joined together . they are firm on him . they can 't be moved .
he makes a path shine after him . one would think the deep had white hair .
you said , ' Listen , now , and I will speak ; I will question you , and you will answer me . '
after this Job lived one hundred forty years , and saw his sons , and his sons ' sons , to four generations .
he will be like a tree planted by the streams of water , that brings forth its fruit in its season , whose leaf also does not wither . whatever he does shall prosper .
" let 's break their bonds apart , and cast their cords from us . "
& lt ; & lt ; A Psalm by David , when he fled from Absalom his son . & gt ; & gt ; Yahweh , how my adversaries have increased ! many are those who rise up against me .
arise , Yahweh ! save me , my God ! for you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone . you have broken the teeth of the wicked .
but know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is godly : Yahweh will hear when I call to him .
for you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness . evil can 't live with you .
the arrogant shall not stand in your sight . you hate all workers of iniquity .
lead me , Yahweh , in your righteousness because of my enemies . make your way straight before my face .
hold them guilty , God . let them fall by their own counsels ; Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions , for they have rebelled against you .
but let all those who take refuge in you rejoice , Let them always shout for joy , because you defend them . let them also who love your name be joyful in you .
for in death there is no memory of you . in Sheol , who shall give you thanks ?
my eye wastes away because of grief . it grows old because of all my adversaries .
arise , Yahweh , in your anger . lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries . awake for me . you have commanded judgment .
let the congregation of the peoples surround you . rule over them on high .
Yahweh administers judgment to the peoples . judge me , Yahweh , according to my righteousness , and to my integrity that is in me .
I will be glad and rejoice in you . I will sing praise to your name , O Most High .
when my enemies turn back , they stumble and perish in your presence .
those who know your name will put their trust in you , for you , Yahweh , have not forsaken those who seek you .
for the wicked boasts of his heart 's cravings . he blesses the greedy , and condemns Yahweh .
he lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush . he lies in wait to catch the helpless . he catches the helpless , when he draws him in his net .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . by David . & gt ; & gt ; In Yahweh , I take refuge . how can you say to my soul , " Flee as a bird to your mountain ! "
but I trust in your loving kindness . my heart rejoices in your salvation .
I will sing to Yahweh , because he has been good to me .
& lt ; & lt ; A Psalm by David . & gt ; & gt ; Yahweh , who shall dwell in your sanctuary ? who shall live on your holy hill ?
he who doesn 't slander with his tongue , nor does evil to his friend , nor casts slurs against his fellow man ;
he who doesn 't lend out his money for usury , nor take a bribe against the innocent . he who does these things shall never be shaken .
my soul , you have said to Yahweh , " You are my Lord . apart from you I have no good thing . "
Yahweh assigned my portion and my cup . you made my lot secure .
for you will not leave my soul in Sheol , neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption .
you have proved my heart . you have visited me in the night . you have tried me , and found nothing . I have resolved that my mouth shall not disobey .
show your marvelous loving kindness , you who save those who take refuge by your right hand from their enemies .
from the wicked who oppress me , my deadly enemies , who surround me .
they close up their callous hearts . with their mouth they speak proudly .
arise , Yahweh , confront him . cast him down . deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword ;
as for me , I shall see your face in righteousness . I shall be satisfied , when I awake , with seeing your form .
Yahweh is my rock , my fortress , and my deliverer ; my God , my rock , in whom I take refuge ; my shield , and the horn of my salvation , my high tower .
he made darkness his hiding place , his pavilion around him , darkness of waters , thick clouds of the skies .
then the channels of waters appeared . the foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke , Yahweh , at the blast of the breath of your nostrils .
Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness . according to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me .
for I have kept the ways of Yahweh , and have not wickedly departed from my God .
therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness , according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight .
the foreigners shall fade away , and shall come trembling out of their close places .
he rescues me from my enemies . yes , you lift me up above those who rise up against me . you deliver me from the violent man .
which is as a bridegroom coming out of his room , like a strong man rejoicing to run his course .
who can discern his errors ? forgive me from hidden errors .
remember all your offerings , and accept your burnt sacrifice . Selah .
now I know that Yahweh saves his anointed . he will answer him from his holy heaven , with the saving strength of his right hand .
they are bowed down and fallen , but we rise up , and stand upright .
he asked life of you , you gave it to him , even length of days forever and ever .
your hand will find out all of your enemies . your right hand will find out those who hate you .
you will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger . Yahweh will swallow them up in his wrath . the fire shall devour them .
for they intended evil against you . they plotted evil against you which CANNOT succeed .
for you will make them turn their back , when you aim drawn bows at their face .
they open their mouths wide against me , lions tearing prey and roaring .
they divide my garments among them . they cast lots for my clothing .
I will declare your name to my brothers . in the midst of the assembly , I will praise you .
all the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship . all those who go down to the dust shall bow before him , even he who can 't keep his soul alive .
this is the generation of those who seek Him , who seek your face--even Jacob . Selah .
yes , no one who waits for you shall be shamed . they shall be shamed who deal treacherously without cause .
Don 't remember the sins of my youth , nor my transgressions . remember me according to your loving kindness , for your goodness ' sake , Yahweh .
consider my enemies , for they are many . they hate me with cruel hatred .
for your loving kindness is before my eyes . I have walked in your truth .
Yahweh , I love the habitation of your house , the place where your glory dwells .
Don 't gather my soul with sinners , nor my life with bloodthirsty men ;
& lt ; & lt ; By David . & gt ; & gt ; Yahweh is my light and my salvation . whom shall I fear ? Yahweh is the strength of my life . of whom shall I be afraid ?
one thing I have asked of Yahweh , that I will seek after , that I may dwell in the house of Yahweh all the days of my life , to see Yahweh 's beauty , and to inquire in his temple .
for in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion . in the covert of his tabernacle he will hide me . he will lift me up on a rock .
when you said , " Seek my face , " my heart said to you , " I will seek your face , Yahweh . "
Don 't hide your face from me . Don 't put your servant away in anger . you have been my help . Don 't abandon me , neither forsake me , God of my salvation .
teach me your way , Yahweh . lead me in a straight path , because of my enemies .
hear the voice of my petitions , when I cry to you , when I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place .
I cried to you , Yahweh . to Yahweh I made supplication :
" what profit is there in my destruction , if I go down to the pit ? shall the dust praise you ? shall it declare your truth ?
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . a Psalm by David . & gt ; & gt ; In you , Yahweh , I take refuge . let me never be disappointed . deliver me in your righteousness .
I will be glad and rejoice in your loving kindness , for you have seen my affliction . you have known my soul in adversities .
because of all my adversaries I have become utterly contemptible to my neighbors , A fear to my acquaintances . those who saw me on the street fled from me .
my times are in your hand . deliver me from the hand of my enemies , and from those who persecute me .
make your face to shine on your servant . save me in your loving kindness .
Oh how great is your goodness , which you have laid up for those who fear you , which you have worked for those who take refuge in you , before the sons of men !
in the shelter of your presence you will hide them from the plotting of man . you will keep them secretly in a dwelling away from the strife of tongues .
when I kept silence , my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long .
let your loving kindness be on us , Yahweh , since we have hoped in you .
keep your tongue from evil , and your lips from speaking lies .
for without cause they have hidden their net in a pit for me . without cause they have dug a pit for my soul .
wake up ! rise up to defend me , my God ! my Lord , contend for me !
let them shout for joy and be glad , who favor my righteous cause . yes , let them say continually , " Yahweh be magnified , who has pleasure in the prosperity of his servant ! "
my tongue shall talk about your righteousness and about your praise all day long .
for with you is the spring of life . in your light shall we see light .
Oh continue your loving kindness to those who know you , your righteousness to the upright in heart .
rest in Yahweh , and wait patiently for him . Don 't fret because of him who prospers in his way , because of the man who makes wicked plots happen .
the wicked have drawn out the sword , and have bent their bow , to cast down the poor and needy , to kill those who are upright in the way .
& lt ; & lt ; A Psalm by David , for a memorial . & gt ; & gt ; Yahweh , don 't rebuke me in your wrath , neither chasten me in your hot displeasure .
there is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation , neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin .
for my waist is filled with burning . there is no soundness in my flesh .
Lord , all my desire is before you . my groaning is not hidden from you .
my lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague . my kinsmen stand far away .
my heart was hot within me . while I meditated , the fire burned : I spoke with my tongue :
now , Lord , what do I wait for ? my hope is in you .
remove your scourge away from me . I am overcome by the blow of your hand .
" hear my prayer , Yahweh , and give ear to my cry . Don 't be silent at my tears . for I am a stranger with you , a foreigner , as all my fathers were .
he has put a new song in my mouth , even praise to our God . many shall see it , and fear , and shall trust in Yahweh .
blessed is the man who makes Yahweh his trust , and doesn 't respect the proud , nor such as turn aside to lies .
I delight to do your will , my God . yes , your law is within my heart . "
I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great assembly . behold , I will not seal my lips , Yahweh , you know .
I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart . I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation . I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth from the great assembly .
for innumerable evils have surrounded me . my iniquities have overtaken me , so that I am not able to look up . they are more than the hairs of my head . my heart has failed me .
let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you . let such as love your salvation say continually , " Let Yahweh be exalted ! "
if he comes to see me , he speaks falsehood . his heart gathers iniquity to itself . when he goes abroad , he tells it .
all who hate me whisper together against me . they imagine the worst for me .
all this has come on us , yet have we not forgotten you , Neither have we been false to your covenant .
you have loved righteousness , and hated wickedness . therefore God , your God , has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows .
kings ' daughters are among your honorable women . at your right hand the queen stands in gold of Ophir .
so the king will desire your beauty , honor him , for he is your lord .
I will make your name to be remembered in all generations . therefore the peoples shall give you thanks forever and ever .
God reigns over the nations . God sits on his holy throne .
my mouth will speak words of wisdom . my heart shall utter understanding .
those who trust in their wealth , and boast in the multitude of their riches--
though while he lived he blessed his soul-- and men praise you when you do well for yourself--
I have no need for a bull from your stall , nor male goats from your pens .
but to the wicked God says , " What right do you have to declare my statutes , that you have taken my covenant on your lips ,
since you hate instruction , and throw my words behind you ?
" you give your mouth to evil . your tongue frames deceit .
you have done these things , and I kept silent . you thought that I was just like you . I will rebuke you , and accuse you in front of your eyes .
whoever offers the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies me , and prepares his way so that I will show God 's salvation to him . "
hide your face from my sins , and blot out all of my iniquities .
restore to me the joy of your salvation . uphold me with a willing spirit .
Lord , open my lips . my mouth shall declare your praise .
" behold , this is the man who didn 't make God his strength , but trusted in the abundance of his riches , and strengthened himself in his wickedness . "
for strangers have risen up against me . violent men have sought after my soul . they haven 't set God before them . Selah .
& lt ; & lt ; For the Chief Musician . on stringed instruments . a contemplation by David . & gt ; & gt ; Listen to my prayer , God . Don 't hide yourself from my supplication .
he raises his hands against his friends . he has violated his covenant .
but you , God , will bring them down into the pit of destruction . bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days , but I will trust in you .
when I am afraid , I will put my trust in you .
shall they escape by iniquity ? in anger cast down the peoples , God .
you number my wanderings . you put my tears into your bottle . aren 't they in your book ?
their poison is like the poison of a snake ; like a deaf cobra that stops its ear ,
the righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance . he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked ;
my God will go before me with his loving kindness . God will let me look at my enemies in triumph .
for the sin of their mouth , and the words of their lips , let them be caught in their pride , for the curses and lies which they utter .
to you , my strength , I will sing praises . for God is my high tower , the God of my mercy .
Gilead is mine , and Manasseh is mine . Ephraim also is the defense of my head . Judah is my scepter .
so I will sing praise to your name forever , that I may fulfill my vows daily .
with God is my salvation and my honor . the rock of my strength , and my refuge , is in God .
so I will bless you while I live . I will lift up my hands in your name .
who sharpen their tongue like a sword , and aim their arrows , deadly words ,
to shoot innocent men from ambushes . they shoot at him suddenly and fearlessly .
their own tongues shall ruin them . all who see them will shake their heads .
blessed is one whom you choose , and cause to come near , that he may live in your courts . we will be filled with the goodness of your house , your holy temple .
which my lips promised , and my mouth spoke , when I was in distress .
the earth has yielded its increase . God , even our own God , will bless us .
but God will strike through the head of his enemies , the hairy scalp of such a one as still continues in his guiltiness .
that you may crush them , dipping your foot in blood , that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from your enemies . "
because of your temple at Jerusalem , kings shall bring presents to you .
princes shall come out of Egypt . Ethiopia shall hurry to stretch out her hands to God .
God , you know my foolishness . my sins aren 't hidden from you .
Don 't let those who wait for you be shamed through me , Lord Yahweh of Armies . Don 't let those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me , God of Israel .
because for your sake , I have borne reproach . shame has covered my face .
for the zeal of your house consumes me . the reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me .
when I made sackcloth my clothing , I became a byword to them .
but as for me , my prayer is to you , Yahweh , in an acceptable time . God , in the abundance of your loving kindness , answer me in the truth of your salvation .
Don 't hide your face from your servant , for I am in distress . answer me speedily !
draw near to my soul , and redeem it . ransom me because of my enemies .
charge them with crime upon crime . Don 't let them come into your righteousness .
let them be disappointed and confounded who seek my soul . let those who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace .
let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you . let those who love your salvation continually say , " Let God be exalted ! "
for my enemies talk about me . those who watch for my soul conspire together ,
let my accusers be disappointed and consumed . let them be covered with disgrace and scorn who want to harm me .
God , you have taught me from my youth . until now , I have declared your wondrous works .
but as for me , my feet were almost gone . my steps had nearly slipped .
they have set their mouth in the heavens . their tongue walks through the earth .
if I had said , " I will speak thus " ; behold , I would have betrayed the generation of your children .
for , behold , those who are far from you shall perish . you have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you .
but it is good for me to come close to God . I have made the Lord Yahweh my refuge , that I may tell of all your works .
remember your congregation , which you purchased of old , which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance ; Mount Zion , in which you have lived .
your adversaries have roared in the midst of your assembly . they have set up their standards as signs .
they said in their heart , " We will crush them completely . " they have burned up all the places in the land where God was worshiped .
Don 't forget the voice of your adversaries . the tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually .
valiant men lie plundered , they have slept their last sleep . none of the men of war can lift their hands .
you , even you , are to be feared . who can stand in your sight when you are angry ?
you hold my eyelids open . I am so troubled that I can 't speak .
I will also meditate on all your work , and consider your doings .
the voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind . the lightnings lit up the world . the earth trembled and shook .
that they might set their hope in God , and not forget the works of God , but keep his commandments ,
and might not be as their fathers , a stubborn and rebellious generation , a generation that didn 't make their hearts loyal , whose spirit was not steadfast with God .
they tempted God in their heart by asking food according to their desire .
he caused the east wind to blow in the sky . by his power he guided the south wind .
but they flattered him with their mouth , and lied to him with their tongue .
but he , being merciful , forgave iniquity , and didn 't destroy them . yes , many times he turned his anger away , and didn 't stir up all his wrath .
for they provoked him to anger with their high places , and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images .
so he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart , and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands .
pour out your wrath on the nations that don 't know you ; on the kingdoms that don 't call on your name ;
so we , your people and sheep of your pasture , will give you thanks forever . we will praise you forever , to all generations .
so we will not turn away from you . revive us , and we will call on your name .
for they have conspired together with one mind . they form an alliance against you .
yes , the sparrow has found a home , and the swallow a nest for herself , where she may have her young , near your altars , Yahweh of Armies , my King , and my God .
for a day in your courts is better than a thousand . I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God , than to dwell in the tents of wickedness .
Yahweh of Armies , blessed is the man who trusts in you .
righteousness goes before him , And prepares the way for his steps .
preserve my soul , for I am godly . you , my God , save your servant who trusts in you .
in the day of my trouble I will call on you , for you will answer me .
God , the proud have risen up against me . a company of violent men have sought after my soul , and they don 't hold regard for you before them .
set apart among the dead , like the slain who lie in the grave , whom you remember no more . they are cut off from your hand .
you have taken my friends from me . you have made me an abomination to them . I am confined , and I can 't escape .
is your loving kindness declared in the grave ? or your faithfulness in Destruction ?
but to you , Yahweh , I have cried . in the morning , my prayer comes before you .
you have put lover and friend far from me , and my friends into darkness .
the heavens will praise your wonders , Yahweh ; your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones .
you have broken Rahab in pieces , like one of the slain . you have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm .
righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne . loving kindness and truth go before your face .
blessed are the people who learn to acclaim you . they walk in the light of your presence , Yahweh .
if his children forsake my law , and don 't walk in my ordinances ;
if they break my statutes , and don 't keep my commandments ;
but I will not completely take my loving kindness from him , nor allow my faithfulness to fail .
but you have rejected and spurned . you have been angry with your anointed .
all who pass by the way rob him . he has become a reproach to his neighbors .
what man is he who shall live and not see death , who shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol ? Selah .
because you have made Yahweh your refuge , and the Most High your dwelling place ,
for he will put his angels in charge of you , to guard you in all your ways .
you who love Yahweh , hate evil . he preserves the souls of his saints . he delivers them out of the hand of the wicked .
he who practices deceit won 't dwell within my house . he who speaks falsehood won 't be established before my eyes .
& lt ; & lt ; A Prayer of the afflicted , when he is overwhelmed and pours out his complaint before Yahweh . & gt ; & gt ; Hear my prayer , Yahweh ! let my cry come to you .
Don 't hide your face from me in the day of my distress . turn your ear to me . answer me quickly in the day when I call .
because of your indignation and your wrath , for you have taken me up , and thrown me away .
so the nations will fear the name of Yahweh ; all the kings of the earth your glory .
for Yahweh has built up Zion . he has appeared in his glory .
the children of your servants will continue . their seed will be established before you . "
he made known his ways to Moses , his deeds to the children of Israel .
man goes forth to his work , to his labor until the evening .
you give to them ; they gather . you open your hand ; they are satisfied with good .
" Don 't touch my anointed ones ! do my prophets no harm ! "
he brought forth his people with joy , his chosen with singing .
thus they exchanged their glory for an image of a bull that eats grass .
but murmured in their tents , and didn 't listen to Yahweh 's voice .
thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds . the plague broke in on them .
yes , they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons .
they shed innocent blood , even the blood of their sons and of their daughters , whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan . the land was polluted with blood .
many times he delivered them , but they were rebellious in their counsel , and were brought low in their iniquity .
he remembered for them his covenant , and repented according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses .
fools are afflicted because of their disobedience , and because of their iniquities .
let his children be wandering beggars . let them be sought from their ruins .

it is well with the man who deals graciously and lends . he will maintain his cause in judgment .
his heart is established . he will not be afraid in the end when he sees his adversaries .
not to us , Yahweh , not to us , but to your name give glory , for your loving kindness , and for your truth 's sake .

how sweet are your promises to my taste , more than honey to my mouth !
I am afflicted very much . revive me , Yahweh , according to your word .
my soul is continually in my hand , yet I won 't forget your law .

with which the reaper doesn 't fill his hand , nor he who binds sheaves , his bosom .
Lord , hear my voice . let your ears be attentive to the voice of my petitions .
I will not give sleep to my eyes , or slumber to my eyelids ;
arise , Yahweh , into your resting place ; you , and the ark of your strength .
Yahweh will fulfill that which concerns me ; your loving kindness , Yahweh , endures forever . Don 't forsake the works of your own hands .

for they speak against you wickedly . your enemies take your name in vain .
Yahweh , don 't I hate those who hate you ? am I not grieved with those who rise up against you ?
they have sharpened their tongues like a serpent . viper 's poison is under their lips . Selah .
Yahweh , the Lord , the strength of my salvation , you have covered my head in the day of battle .

listen to my cry , for I am in desperate need. deliver me from my persecutors , For they are stronger than me .
& lt ; & lt ; A Psalm by David . & gt ; & gt ; Hear my prayer , Yahweh . listen to my petitions . in your faithfulness and righteousness , relieve me .

cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning , for I trust in you . cause me to know the way in which I should walk , for I lift up my soul to you .

but you have ignored all my counsel , and wanted none of my reproof ;
who are crooked in their ways , and wayward in their paths :
my son , don 't forget my teaching ; but let your heart keep my commandments :
trust in Yahweh with all your heart , and don 't lean on your own understanding .
it will be health to your body , and nourishment to your bones .
honor Yahweh with your substance , with the first fruits of all your increase :
so they will be life to your soul , and grace for your neck .
Don 't say to your neighbor , " Go , and come again ; tomorrow I will give it to you , " when you have it by you .
for I was a son to my father , tender and an only child in the sight of my mother .

lest strangers feast on your wealth , and your labors enrich another man 's house .
neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers , nor turned my ear to those who instructed me !
give no sleep to your eyes , nor slumber to your eyelids .
my son , keep your father 's commandment , and don 't forsake your mother 's teaching .
or can one walk on hot coals , and his feet not be scorched ?

tell wisdom , " You are my sister . " call understanding your relative ,
that they may keep you from the strange woman , from the foreigner who flatters with her words .

the appetite of the laboring man labors for him ; for his mouth urges him on .
he who loves disobedience loves strife . one who builds a high gate seeks destruction .
he who becomes the father of a fool grieves . the father of a fool has no joy .

as one who takes away a garment in cold weather , or vinegar on soda , so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart .
like a city that is broken down and without walls is a man whose spirit is without restraint .
as a dog that returns to his vomit , so is a fool who repeats his folly .
the sluggard buries his hand in the dish . he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth .

your sun shall no more go down , neither shall your moon withdraw itself ; for Yahweh will be your everlasting light , and the days of your mourning shall be ended .
instead of your shame you shall have double ; and instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their portion : therefore in their land they shall possess double ; everlasting joy shall be to them .
why are you red in your clothing , and your garments like him who treads in the wine vat ?
then he remembered the days of old , Moses and his people , saying , Where is he who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock ? where is he who put his holy Spirit in their midst ?
look down from heaven , and see from the habitation of your holiness and of your glory : where are your zeal and your mighty acts ? the yearning of your heart and your compassion is restrained toward me .

as when fire kindles the brushwood , and the fire causes the waters to boil ; to make your name known to your adversaries , that the nations may tremble at your presence !
for from of old men have not heard , nor perceived by the ear , neither has the eye seen a God besides you , who works for him who waits for him .
there is none who calls on your name , who stirs up himself to take hold of you ; for you have hidden your face from us , and have consumed us by means of our iniquities .
so that he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth ; and he who swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth ; because the former troubles are forgotten , and because they are hidden from my eyes .

in all your abominations and your prostitution you have not remembered the days of your youth , when you were naked and bare , and were wallowing in your blood .
it has happened after all your wickedness , ( woe , woe to you ! says the Lord Yahweh ) ,
in that you build your vaulted place at the head of every way , and make your lofty place in every street , and have not been as a prostitute , in that you scorn pay .
they give gifts to all prostitutes ; but you give your gifts to all your lovers , and bribe them , that they may come to you on every side for your prostitution .

your elder sister is Samaria , who dwells at your left hand , she and her daughters ; and your younger sister , who dwells at your right hand , is Sodom and her daughters .
behold , this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom : pride , fullness of bread , and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters ; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy .
neither has Samaria committed half of your sins ; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they , and have justified your sisters by all your abominations which you have done .
I will turn again their captivity , the captivity of Sodom and her daughters , and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters , and the captivity of your captives in their midst ;
for your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride ,
nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth , and I will establish to you an everlasting covenant .

say now to the rebellious house , Don 't you know what these things mean ? tell them , Behold , the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem , and took its king , and its princes , and brought them to him to Babylon :
and he took of the seed royal , and made a covenant with him ; he also brought him under an oath , and took away the mighty of the land ;
but he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt , that they might give him horses and many people . shall he prosper ? shall he escape who does such things ? shall he break the covenant , and yet escape ?
for he has despised the oath by breaking the covenant ; and behold , he had given his hand , and yet has done all these things ; he shall not escape .
and has not eaten on the mountains , neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , neither has defiled his neighbor 's wife , neither has come near to a woman in her impurity ,
he who has not given forth on interest , neither has taken any increase , who has withdrawn his hand from iniquity , has executed true justice between man and man ,
who has withdrawn his hand from the poor , who has not received interest nor increase , has executed my ordinances , has walked in my statutes ; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father , he shall surely live .
but if the wicked turn from all his sins that he has committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked ? says the Lord Yahweh ; and not rather that he should return from his way , and live ?
again , when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed , and does that which is lawful and right , he shall save his soul alive .
because he considers , and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
yet the house of Israel says , " The way of the Lord is not fair . " house of Israel , aren 't my ways fair ? aren 't your ways unfair ?

it had strong rods for the scepters of those who bore rule , and their stature was exalted among the thick boughs , and they were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches .
because they had not executed my ordinances , but had rejected my statutes , and had profaned my Sabbaths , and their eyes were after their fathers ' idols .
therefore tell the house of Israel , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : do you pollute yourselves in the way of your fathers ? and do you play the prostitute after their abominations ?
I will pour out my indignation on you ; I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath ; and I will deliver you into the hand of brutish men , skillful to destroy .
you shall say , Thus says the Lord Yahweh : a city that sheds blood in the midst of her , that her time may come , and that makes idols against herself to defile her !
behold , the princes of Israel , everyone according to his power , have been in you to shed blood .
in you have they uncovered their fathers ' nakedness ; in you have they humbled her who was unclean in her impurity .
behold , therefore , I have struck my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made , and at your blood which has been in the midst of you .
I will scatter you among the nations , and disperse you through the countries ; and I will consume your filthiness out of you .
you shall be profaned in yourself , in the sight of the nations ; and you shall know that I am Yahweh .
Oholah played the prostitute when she was mine ; and she doted on her lovers , on the Assyrians [ her ] neighbors ,
she increased her prostitution ; for she saw men portrayed on the wall , the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion ,
as soon as she saw them she doted on them , and sent messengers to them into Chaldea .
so she uncovered her prostitution , and uncovered her nakedness : then my soul was alienated from her , like as my soul was alienated from her sister .
therefore , Oholibah , thus says the Lord Yahweh : behold , I will raise up your lovers against you , from whom your soul is alienated , and I will bring them against you on every side :
thus will I make your lewdness to cease from you , and your prostitution [ brought ] from the land of Egypt ; so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them , nor remember Egypt any more .
and they shall deal with you in hatred , and shall take away all your labor , and shall leave you naked and bare ; and the nakedness of your prostitution shall be uncovered , both your lewdness and your prostitution .
you shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow , with the cup of astonishment and desolation , with the cup of your sister Samaria .

( but if she departs , let her remain unmarried , or else be reconciled to her husband ) , and that the husband not leave his wife .
for he who eats and drinks in an unworthy way eats and drinks judgment to himself , if he doesn 't discern the Lord 's body .
for if we discerned ourselves , we wouldn 't be judged .
if they desire to learn anything , let them ask their own husbands at home , for it is shameful for a woman to chatter in the assembly .
on the first day of the week , let each one of you save , as he may prosper , that no collections be made when I come .
yes , we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves , that we should not trust in ourselves , but in God who raises the dead ,
but I determined this for myself , that I would not come to you again in sorrow .
not that we are sufficient of ourselves , to account anything as from ourselves ; but our sufficiency is from God ;
and not as Moses , who put a veil on his face , that the children of Israel wouldn 't look steadfastly on the end of that which was passing away .
for if we are beside ourselves , it is for God . or if we are of sober mind , it is for you .
for we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves . but they themselves , measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves with themselves , are without understanding .
test your own selves , whether you are in the faith . test your own selves . or don 't you know as to your own selves , that Jesus Christ is in you ? --unless indeed you are disqualified .
then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas , taking Titus also with me .
that which was a temptation to you in my flesh , you didn 't despise nor reject ; but you received me as an angel of God , even as Christ Jesus .
I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way . but he who troubles you will bear his judgment , whoever he is .
for the whole law is fulfilled in one word , in this : " you shall love your neighbor as yourself . "
brothers , even if a man is caught in some fault , you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness ; looking to yourself so that you also aren 't tempted .
for if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing , he deceives himself .
but let each man test his own work , and then he will take pride in himself and not in his neighbor .
in whom also we were assigned an inheritance , having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will ;
Don 't cease to give thanks for you , making mention of you in my prayers ,
but God , being rich in mercy , for his great love with which he loved us ,
that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus ;
therefore putting away falsehood , speak truth each one with his neighbor . for we are members of one another .
let all bitterness , wrath , anger , outcry , and slander , be put away from you , with all malice .
speaking to one another in psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs ; singing , and making melody in your heart to the Lord ;
servants , be obedient to those who according to the flesh are your masters , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as to Christ ;
doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit , but in humility , each counting others better than himself ;
for they all seek their own , not the things of Jesus Christ .
yes , I beg you also , true yokefellow , help these women , for they labored with me in the Good News , with Clement also , and the rest of my fellow workers , whose names are in the book of life .
forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved ; to fill up their sins always . but wrath has come on them to the uttermost .
therefore he who rejects this doesn 't reject man , but God , who has also given his Holy Spirit to you .
and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , even as we instructed you ;
for the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the archangel , and with God 's trumpet . the dead in Christ will rise first ,
one who rules his own house well , having children in subjection with all reverence ;
let servants be husbands of one wife , ruling their children and their own houses well .
pay attention to yourself , and to your teaching . continue in these things , for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you .
but if anyone doesn 't provide for his own , and especially his own household , he has denied the faith , and is worse than an unbeliever .
let as many as are bondservants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor , that the name of God and the doctrine not be blasphemed .
charge those who are rich in this present world that they not be haughty , nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches , but on the living God , who richly provides us with everything to enjoy ;
having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you ; which lived first in your grandmother Lois , and your mother Eunice , and , I am persuaded , in you also .
remember Jesus Christ , risen from the dead , of the seed of David , according to my Good News ,
and the Lord will deliver me from every evil work , and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom ; to whom be the glory forever and ever . Amen .
in all things showing yourself an example of good works ; in your teaching showing integrity , seriousness , incorruptibility ,
I thank my God always , making mention of you in my prayers ,
I beg you for my child , whom I have become the father of in my chains , Onesimus ,
whom I desired to keep with me , that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News .
of the angels he says , " Who makes his angels winds , and his servants a flame of fire . "
but of the Son he says , " Your throne , O God , is forever and ever . the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your Kingdom .
you have loved righteousness , and hated iniquity ; therefore God , your God , has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows . "
and , " You , Lord , in the beginning , laid the foundation of the earth . the heavens are the works of your hands .
as a mantle , you will roll them up , and they will be changed ; but you are the same . your years will not fail . "
for he has said this somewhere about the seventh day , " God rested on the seventh day from all his works " ;
for he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his works , as God did from his .
nobody takes this honor on himself , but he is called by God , just like Aaron was .
here people who die receive tithes , but there one receives tithes of whom it is testified that he lives .
they will not teach every man his fellow citizen , and every man his brother , saying , ' Know the Lord , ' for all will know me , from their least to their greatest .
but into the second the high priest alone , once in the year , not without blood , which he offers for himself , and for the errors of the people .
then I said , ' Behold , I have come ( in the scroll of the book it is written of me ) to do your will , O God . ' "
then he has said , " Behold , I have come to do your will . " he takes away the first , that he may establish the second ,
by faith , Enoch was taken away , so that he wouldn 't see death , and he was not found , because God translated him . for he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to God .
by faith , Noah , being warned about things not yet seen , moved with godly fear , prepared a ship for the saving of his house , through which he condemned the world , and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith .
therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore , were fathered by one man , and him as good as dead .
these all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them and embraced them from afar , and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt ; for he looked to the reward .
he is a double @-@ minded man , unstable in all his ways .
but be doers of the word , and not only hearers , deluding your own selves .
for if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer , he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror ;
for he sees himself , and goes away , and immediately forgets what kind of man he was .
and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing , and say , " Sit here in a good place " ; and you tell the poor man , " Stand there , " or " Sit by my footstool " ;
haven 't you shown partiality among yourselves , and become judges with evil thoughts ?
however , if you fulfill the royal law , according to the Scripture , " You shall love your neighbor as yourself , " you do well .
yes , a man will say , " You have faith , and I have works . " show me your faith without works , and I by my works will show you my faith .
you see then that by works , a man is justified , and not only by faith .
he prayed again , and the sky gave rain , and the earth brought forth its fruit .
you also , as living stones , are built up as a spiritual house , to be a holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .
for , " He who would love life , and see good days , let him keep his tongue from evil , and his lips from speaking deceit .
forasmuch then as Christ suffered for us in the flesh , arm yourselves also with the same mind ; for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin ;
but false prophets also arose among the people , as false teachers will also be among you , who will secretly bring in destructive heresies , denying even the Master who bought them , bringing on themselves swift destruction .
if we say that we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
by this we know love , because he laid down his life for us . and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers .
but whoever has the world 's goods , and sees his brother in need , and closes his heart of compassion against him , how does the love of God remain in him ?
in this is love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us , and sent his Son as the atoning sacrifice for our sins .
this commandment we have from him , that he who loves God should also love his brother .
he who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself . he who doesn 't believe God has made him a liar , because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son .
I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth , even as we have been commanded by the Father .
watch yourselves , that we don 't lose the things which we have accomplished , but that we receive a full reward .
they said to you that " In the last time there will be mockers , walking after their own ungodly lusts . "
this is the Revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave him to show to his servants the things which must happen soon , which he sent and made known by his angel to his servant , John ,
I was in the Spirit on the Lord 's day , and I heard behind me a loud voice , like a trumpet
he had seven stars in his right hand . out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two @-@ edged sword . his face was like the sun shining at its brightest .
but I have this against you , that you left your first love .
" I know your works , oppression , and your poverty ( but you are rich ) , and the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews , and they are not , but are a synagogue of Satan .
" I know your works , your love , faith , service , patient endurance , and that your last works are more than the first .
nevertheless you have a few names in Sardis that did not defile their garments . they will walk with me in white , for they are worthy .
I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire , that you may become rich ; and white garments , that you may clothe yourself , and that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed ; and eye salve to anoint your eyes , that you may see .
immediately I was in the Spirit . behold , there was a throne set in heaven , and one sitting on the throne
around the throne were twenty @-@ four thrones . on the thrones were twenty @-@ four elders sitting , dressed in white garments , with crowns of gold on their heads .
the twenty @-@ four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne , and worship him who lives forever and ever , and throw their crowns before the throne , saying ,
when he opened the third seal , I heard the third living creature saying , " Come and see ! " and behold , a black horse , and he who sat on it had a balance in his hand .
the stars of the sky fell to the earth , like a fig tree dropping its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind .
the sky was removed like a scroll when it is rolled up . every mountain and island were moved out of their places .
I told him , " My lord , you know . " he said to me , " These are those who came out of the great tribulation . they washed their robes , and made them white in the Lamb 's blood .
they didn 't repent of their murders , nor of their sorceries , nor of their sexual immorality , nor of their thefts .
he had in his hand a little open book . he set his right foot on the sea , and his left on the land .
the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to the sky ,
the seventh angel sounded , and great voices in heaven followed , saying , " The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord , and of his Christ . he will reign forever and ever ! "
the twenty @-@ four elders , who sit on their thrones before God 's throne , fell on their faces and worshiped God ,
God 's temple that is in heaven was opened , and the ark of the Lord 's covenant was seen in his temple . Lightnings , sounds , thunders , an earthquake , and great hail followed .
another sign was seen in heaven . behold , a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and on his heads seven crowns .
the beast which I saw was like a leopard , and his feet were like those of a bear , and his mouth like the mouth of a lion . the dragon gave him his power , his throne , and great authority .
he opened his mouth for blasphemy against God , to blaspheme his name , and his dwelling , those who dwell in heaven .
I heard a sound from heaven , like the sound of many waters , and like the sound of a great thunder . the sound which I heard was like that of harpists playing on their harps .
I heard the voice from heaven saying , " Write , ' Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on . ' " " yes , " says the Spirit , " that they may rest from their labors ; for their works follow with them . "
he who sat on the cloud thrust his sickle on the earth , and the earth was reaped .
another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven . he also had a sharp sickle .
the angel thrust his sickle into the earth , and gathered the vintage of the earth , and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God .
I saw another great and marvelous sign in the sky : seven angels having the seven last plagues , for in them God 's wrath is finished .
who wouldn 't fear you , Lord , and glorify your name ? for you only are holy . for all the nations will come and worship before you . for your righteous acts have been revealed . "
the first went , and poured out his bowl into the earth , and it became a harmful and evil sore on the people who had the mark of the beast , and who worshiped his image .
the second angel poured out his bowl into the sea , and it became blood as of a dead man . every living thing in the sea died .
the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of water , and they became blood .
the fourth poured out his bowl on the sun , and it was given to him to scorch men with fire .
the fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast , and his kingdom was darkened . they gnawed their tongues because of the pain ,
and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores . they didn 't repent of their works .
the sixth poured out his bowl on the great river , the Euphrates . its water was dried up , that the way might be prepared for the kings that come from the sunrise .
" behold , I come like a thief . blessed is he who watches , and keeps his clothes , so that he doesn 't walk naked , and they see his shame . "
the fruits which your soul lusted after have been lost to you , and all things that were dainty and sumptuous have perished from you , and you will find them no more at all .
after these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven , saying , " Hallelujah ! salvation , power , and glory belong to our God :
the sea gave up the dead who were in it . death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them . they were judged , each one according to his works .
in the middle of its street . on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life , bearing twelve kinds of fruits , yielding its fruit every month . the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made ; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made .
and God blessed the seventh day , and sanctified it : because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made .
and Adam said , This is now bone of my bones , and flesh of my flesh : she shall be called Woman , because she was taken out of Man .
therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his wife : and they shall be one flesh .
unto the woman he said , I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception ; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children ; and thy desire shall be to thy husband , and he shall rule over thee .
and Adam called his wife 's name Eve ; because she was the mother of all living .
and Abel , he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof . and the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering :
if thou doest well , shalt thou not be accepted ? and if thou doest not well , sin lieth at the door . and unto thee shall be his desire , and thou shalt rule over him .
and now art thou cursed from the earth , which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother 's blood from thy hand ;
when thou tillest the ground , it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength ; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth .
and Lamech said unto his wives , Adah and Zillah , Hear my voice ; ye wives of Lamech , hearken unto my speech : for I have slain a man to my wounding , and a young man to my hurt .
and Adam lived an hundred and thirty years , and begat a son in his own likeness , after his image ; and called his name Seth :
that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair ; and they took them wives of all which they chose .
these are the generations of Noah : Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations , and Noah walked with God .
and God looked upon the earth , and , behold , it was corrupt ; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth .
and God said unto Noah , The end of all flesh is come before me ; for the earth is filled with violence through them ; and , behold , I will destroy them with the earth .
and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten , and thou shalt gather it to thee ; and it shall be for food for thee , and for them .
all in whose nostrils was the breath of life , of all that was in the dry land , died .
also he sent forth a dove from him , to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground ;
but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot , and she returned unto him into the ark , for the waters were on the face of the whole earth : then he put forth his hand , and took her , and pulled her in unto him into the ark .
bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee , of all flesh , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth ; that they may breed abundantly in the earth , and be fruitful , and multiply upon the earth .
every beast , every creeping thing , and every fowl , and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth , after their kinds , went forth out of the ark .
and the LORD smelled a sweet savour ; and the LORD said in his heart , I will not again curse the ground any more for man 's sake ; for the imagination of man 's heart is evil from his youth ; neither will I again smite any more every thing living , as I have done .
and he drank of the wine , and was drunken ; and he was uncovered within his tent .
and Shem and Japheth took a garment , and laid it upon both their shoulders , and went backward , and covered the nakedness of their father ; and their faces were backward , and they saw not their father 's nakedness .
and he said , Cursed be Canaan ; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren .
by these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands ; every one after his tongue , after their families , in their nations .
now the LORD had said unto Abram , Get thee out of thy country , and from thy kindred , and from thy father 's house , unto a land that I will shew thee :
and it came to pass , when he was come near to enter into Egypt , that he said unto Sarai his wife , Behold now , I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon :
why saidst thou , She is my sister ? so I might have taken her to me to wife : now therefore behold thy wife , take her , and go thy way .
and he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel , unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning , between Bethel and Hai ;
and blessed be the most high God , which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand . and he gave him tithes of all .
and the king of Sodom said unto Abram , Give me the persons , and take the goods to thyself .
and Abram said , Lord GOD , what wilt thou give me , seeing I go childless , and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus ?
and , behold , the word of the LORD came unto him , saying , This shall not be thine heir ; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir .
and he said unto Abram , Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs , and shall serve them ; and they shall afflict them four hundred years ;
and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace ; thou shalt be buried in a good old age .
and he said , Hagar , Sarai 's maid , whence camest thou ? and whither wilt thou go ? and she said , I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai .
and Hagar bare Abram a son : and Abram called his son 's name , which Hagar bare , Ishmael .
and Abram fell on his face : and God talked with him , saying ,
and I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant , to be a God unto thee , and to thy seed after thee .
and I will give unto thee , and to thy seed after thee , the land wherein thou art a stranger , all the land of Canaan , for an everlasting possession ; and I will be their God .
then Abraham fell upon his face , and laughed , and said in his heart , Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old ? and shall Sarah , that is ninety years old , bear ?
and Abraham took Ishmael his son , and all that were born in his house , and all that were bought with his money , every male among the men of Abraham 's house ; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day , as God had said unto him .
and Lot went out at the door unto them , and shut the door after him ,
and it came to pass , when they had brought them forth abroad , that he said , Escape for thy life ; look not behind thee , neither stay thou in all the plain ; escape to the mountain , lest thou be consumed .
therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning , and called all his servants , and told all these things in their ears : and the men were sore afraid .
then Abimelech called Abraham , and said unto him , What hast thou done unto us ? and what have I offended thee , that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin ? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done .
and unto Sarah he said , Behold , I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver : behold , he is to thee a covering of the eyes , unto all that are with thee , and with all other : thus she was reproved .
and Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him , whom Sarah bare to him , Isaac .
and Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old , as God had commanded him .
and Abraham rose up early in the morning , and saddled his ass , and took two of his young men with him , and Isaac his son , and clave the wood for the burnt offering , and rose up , and went unto the place of which God had told him .
and Abraham said unto his young men , Abide ye here with the ass ; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship , and come again to you ,
and he said , Lay not thine hand upon the lad , neither do thou any thing unto him : for now I know that thou fearest God , seeing thou hast not withheld thy son , thine only son from me .
and Abraham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns : and Abraham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son .
and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed ; because thou hast obeyed my voice .
I am a stranger and a sojourner with you : give me a possession of a buryingplace with you , that I may bury my dead out of my sight .
my lord , hearken unto me : the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver ; what is that betwixt me and thee ? bury therefore thy dead .
and Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house , that ruled over all that he had , Put , I pray thee , thy hand under my thigh :
and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee , then thou shalt be clear from this my oath : only bring not my son thither again .
and the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master , and sware to him concerning that matter .
and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master , and departed ; for all the goods of his master were in his hand : and he arose , and went to Mesopotamia , unto the city of Nahor .
and she said , Drink , my lord : and she hasted , and let down her pitcher upon her hand , and gave him drink .
and when she had done giving him drink , she said , I will draw water for thy camels also , until they have done drinking .
and she hasted , and emptied her pitcher into the trough , and ran again unto the well to draw water , and drew for all his camels .
and she made haste , and let down her pitcher from her shoulder , and said , Drink , and I will give thy camels drink also : so I drank , and she made the camels drink also .
and they blessed Rebekah , and said unto her , Thou art our sister , be thou the mother of thousands of millions , and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them .
and the LORD appeared unto him the same night , and said , I am the God of Abraham thy father : fear not , for I am with thee , and will bless thee , and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham 's sake .
and he builded an altar there , and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there : and there Isaac 's servants digged a well .
and Isaac said unto them , Wherefore come ye to me , seeing ye hate me , and have sent me away from you ?
that thou wilt do us no hurt , as we have not touched thee , and as we have done unto thee nothing but good , and have sent thee away in peace : thou art now the blessed of the LORD .
and Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite , and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite :
and he said , Behold now , I am old , I know not the day of my death :
now therefore , my son , obey my voice according to that which I command thee .
and thou shalt bring it to thy father , that he may eat , and that he may bless thee before his death .
my father peradventure will feel me , and I shall seem to him as a deceiver ; and I shall bring a curse upon me , and not a blessing .
and she gave the savoury meat and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son Jacob .
and he came unto his father , and said , My father : and he said , Here am I ; who art thou , my son ?
and Isaac said unto his son , How is it that thou hast found it so quickly , my son ? and he said , Because the LORD thy God brought it to me .
and it came to pass , as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob , and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Esau his brother came in from his hunting .
and he also had made savoury meat , and brought it unto his father , and said unto his father , Let my father arise , and eat of his son 's venison , that thy soul may bless me .
and when Esau heard the words of his father , he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry , and said unto his father , Bless me , even me also , O my father .
and Isaac answered and said unto Esau , Behold , I have made him thy lord , and all his brethren have I given to him for servants ; and with corn and wine have I sustained him : and what shall I do now unto thee , my son ?
and Esau said unto his father , Hast thou but one blessing , my father ? bless me , even me also , O my father . and Esau lifted up his voice , and wept .
and Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him : and Esau said in his heart , The days of mourning for my father are at hand ; then will I slay my brother Jacob .
now therefore , my son , obey my voice ; and arise , flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran ;
and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother , and was gone to Padan @-@ aram ;
then went Esau unto Ishmael , and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham 's son , the sister of Nebajoth , to be his wife .
and Jacob awaked out of his sleep , and he said , Surely the LORD is in this place ; and I knew it not .
and Jacob kissed Rachel , and lifted up his voice , and wept .
and Jacob told Rachel that he was her father 's brother , and that he was Rebekah 's son : and she ran and told her father .
and Jacob did so , and fulfilled her week : and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also .
and Leah said , Happy am I , for the daughters will call me blessed : and she called his name Asher .
give me my wives and my children , for whom I have served thee , and let me go : for thou knowest my service which I have done thee .
and he said , What shall I give thee ? and Jacob said , Thou shalt not give me any thing : if thou wilt do this thing for me , I will again feed and keep thy flock :
and he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted , and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted , and every one that had some white in it , and all the brown among the sheep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
and he set three days ' journey betwixt himself and Jacob : and Jacob fed the rest of Laban 's flocks .
and Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock ,
then Jacob rose up , and set his sons and his wives upon camels ;
and he carried away all his cattle , and all his goods which he had gotten , the cattle of his getting , which he had gotten in Padan @-@ aram , for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan .
and Laban went to shear his sheep : and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father 's .
and he took his brethren with him , and pursued after him seven days ' journey ; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead .
and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters ? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing .
and now , though thou wouldest needs be gone , because thou sore longedst after thy father 's house , yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods ?
with whomsoever thou findest thy gods , let him not live : before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me , and take it to thee . for Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them .
whereas thou hast searched all my stuff , what hast thou found of all thy household stuff ? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren , that they may judge betwixt us both .
that which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee ; I bare the loss of it ; of my hand didst thou require it , whether stolen by day , or stolen by night .
and Jacob said unto his brethren , Gather stones ; and they took stones , and made an heap : and they did eat there upon the heap .
if thou shalt afflict my daughters , or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters , no man is with us ; see , God is witness betwixt me and thee .
then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount , and called his brethren to eat bread : and they did eat bread , and tarried all night in the mount .
and early in the morning Laban rose up , and kissed his sons and his daughters , and blessed them : and Laban departed , and returned unto his place .
and Jacob went on his way , and the angels of God met him .
and I have oxen , and asses , flocks , and menservants , and womenservants : and I have sent to tell my lord , that I may find grace in thy sight .
and he lodged there that same night ; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother ;
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants , every drove by themselves ; and said unto his servants , Pass over before me , and put a space betwixt drove and drove .
and he rose up that night , and took his two wives , and his two womenservants , and his eleven sons , and passed over the ford Jabbok .
and Esau said , I have enough , my brother ; keep that thou hast unto thyself .
and Jacob said , Nay , I pray thee , if now I have found grace in thy sight , then receive my present at my hand : for therefore I have seen thy face , as though I had seen the face of God , and thou wast pleased with me .
these men are peaceable with us ; therefore let them dwell in the land , and trade therein ; for the land , behold , it is large enough for them ; let us take their daughters to us for wives , and let us give them our daughters .
and let us arise , and go up to Bethel ; and I will make there an altar unto God , who answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the way which I went .
and God said unto him , I am God Almighty : be fruitful and multiply ; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee , and kings shall come out of thy loins ;
and Israel journeyed , and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar .
now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children , because he was the son of his old age : and he made him a coat of many colours .
and he dreamed yet another dream , and told it his brethren , and said , Behold , I have dreamed a dream more ; and , behold , the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me .
and he told it to his father , and to his brethren : and his father rebuked him , and said unto him , What is this dream that thou hast dreamed ? shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth ?
and his brethren went to feed their father 's flock in Shechem .
and Jacob rent his clothes , and put sackcloth upon his loins , and mourned for his son many days .
and Onan knew that the seed should not be his ; and it came to pass , when he went in unto his brother 's wife , that he spilled it on the ground , lest that he should give seed to his brother .
and she arose , and went away , and laid by her Vail from her , and put on the garments of her widowhood .
and the LORD was with Joseph , and he was a prosperous man ; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian .
and it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house , and over all that he had , that the LORD blessed the Egyptian 's house for Joseph 's sake ; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house , and in the field .
there is none greater in this house than I ; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee , because thou art his wife : how then can I do this great wickedness , and sin against God ?
and she caught him by his garment , saying , Lie with me : and he left his garment in her hand , and fled , and got him out .
and it came to pass , when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand , and was fled forth ,
that she called unto the men of her house , and spake unto them , saying , See , he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us ; he came in unto me to lie with me , and I cried with a loud voice :
and she laid up his garment by her , until his lord came home .
and it came to pass , as I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled out .
and the chief butler told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , In my dream , behold , a vine was before me ;
yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee , and shall hang thee on a tree ; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee .
and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled ; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt , and all the wise men thereof : and Pharaoh told them his dream ; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh .
then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph , and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon : and he shaved himself , and changed his raiment , and came in unto Pharaoh .
and Pharaoh said unto his servants , Can we find such a one as this is , a man in whom the Spirit of God is ?
and Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand , and put it upon Joseph 's hand , and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck ;
and Pharaoh said unto Joseph , I am Pharaoh , and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt .
now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt , Jacob said unto his sons , Why do ye look one upon another ?
and Joseph knew his brethren , but they knew not him .
and they laded their asses with the corn , and departed thence .
and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn , he espied his money ; for , behold , it was in his sack 's mouth .
and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks , that , behold , every man 's bundle of money was in his sack : and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money , they were afraid .
and Reuben spake unto his father , saying , Slay my two sons , if I bring him not to thee : deliver him into my hand , and I will bring him to thee again .
and he lifted up his eyes , and saw his brother Benjamin , his mother 's son , and said , Is this your younger brother , of whom ye spake unto me ? and he said , God be gracious unto thee , my son .
and he washed his face , and went out , and refrained himself , and said , Set on bread .
then they rent their clothes , and laded every man his ass , and returned to the city .
my lord asked his servants , saying , Have ye a father , or a brother ?
and thou saidst unto thy servants , Except your youngest brother come down with you , ye shall see my face no more .
now therefore , I pray thee , let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord ; and let the lad go up with his brethren .
then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him ; and he cried , Cause every man to go out from me . and there stood no man with him , while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , I am Joseph ; doth my father yet live ? and his brethren could not answer him ; for they were troubled at his presence .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , Come near to me , I pray you . and they came near . and he said , I am Joseph your brother , whom ye sold into Egypt .
and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen , and thou shalt be near unto me , thou , and thy children , and thy children 's children , and thy flocks , and thy herds , and all that thou hast :
moreover he kissed all his brethren , and wept upon them : and after that his brethren talked with him .
and Pharaoh said unto Joseph , Say unto thy brethren , This do ye ; Lade your beasts , and go , get you unto the land of Canaan ;
and to his father he sent after this manner ; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt , and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way .
and they went up out of Egypt , and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father ,
and he said , I am God , the God of thy father : fear not to go down into Egypt ; for I will there make of thee a great nation :
and Jacob rose up from Beer @-@ sheba : and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father , and their little ones , and their wives , in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him .
and they took their cattle , and their goods , which they had gotten in the land of Canaan , and came into Egypt , Jacob , and all his seed with him :
his sons , and his sons ' sons with him , his daughters , and his sons ' daughters , and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt .
and Joseph made ready his chariot , and went up to meet Israel his father , to Goshen , and presented himself unto him ; and he fell on his neck , and wept on his neck a good while .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , and unto his father 's house , I will go up , and shew Pharaoh , and say unto him , My brethren , and my father 's house , which were in the land of Canaan , are come unto me ;
then Joseph came and told Pharaoh , and said , My father and my brethren , and their flocks , and their herds , and all that they have , are come out of the land of Canaan ; and , behold , they are in the land of Goshen .
and Joseph placed his father and his brethren , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Rameses , as Pharaoh had commanded .
and Joseph nourished his father , and his brethren , and all his father 's household , with bread , according to their families .
and they brought their cattle unto Joseph : and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses , and for the flocks , and for the cattle of the herds , and for the asses : and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year .
but I will lie with my fathers , and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt , and bury me in their buryingplace . and he said , I will do as thou hast said .
and it came to pass after these things , that one told Joseph , Behold , thy father is sick : and he took with him his two sons , Manasseh and Ephraim .
and one told Jacob , and said , Behold , thy son Joseph cometh unto thee : and Israel strengthened himself , and sat upon the bed .
and said unto me , Behold , I will make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , and I will make of thee a multitude of people ; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession .
and thy issue , which thou begettest after them , shall be thine , and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance .
and Israel said unto Joseph , I had not thought to see thy face : and , lo , God hath shewed me also thy seed .
and Joseph brought them out from between his knees , and he bowed himself with his face to the earth .
and when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim , it displeased him : and he held up his father 's hand , to remove it from Ephraim 's head unto Manasseh 's head .
and Jacob called unto his sons , and said , Gather yourselves together , that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days .
Reuben , thou art my firstborn , my might , and the beginning of my strength , the excellency of dignity , and the excellency of power :
binding his foal unto the vine , and his ass 's colt unto the choice vine ; he washed his garments in wine , and his clothes in the blood of grapes :
and he saw that rest was good , and the land that it was pleasant ; and bowed his shoulder to bear , and became a servant unto tribute .
and he charged them , and said unto them , I am to be gathered unto my people : bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite ,
and when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the ghost , and was gathered unto his people .
and all the house of Joseph , and his brethren , and his father 's house : only their little ones , and their flocks , and their herds , they left in the land of Goshen .
and they came to the threshingfloor of Atad , which is beyond Jordan , and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation : and he made a mourning for his father seven days .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , I die : and God will surely visit you , and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob .
now these are the names of the children of Israel , which came into Egypt ; every man and his household came with Jacob .
and when they came to Reuel their father , he said , How is it that ye are come so soon to day ?
and he said unto his daughters , And where is he ? why is it that ye have left the man ? call him , that he may eat bread .
moreover he said , I am the God of thy father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . and Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look upon God .
but every woman shall borrow of her neighbour , and of her that sojourneth in her house , jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment : and ye shall put them upon your sons , and upon your daughters ; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Put forth thine hand , and take it by the tail . and he put forth his hand , and caught it , and it became a rod in his hand :
and the LORD said furthermore unto him , Put now thine hand into thy bosom . and he put his hand into his bosom : and when he took it out , behold , his hand was leprous as snow .
and he said , Put thine hand into thy bosom again . and he put his hand into his bosom again ; and plucked it out of his bosom , and , behold , it was turned again as his other flesh .
and Moses said unto the LORD , O my Lord , I am not eloquent , neither heretofore , nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant : but I am slow of speech , and of a slow tongue .
and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses , and he said , Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother ? I know that he can speak well . and also , behold , he cometh forth to meet thee : and when he seeth thee , he will be glad in his heart .
and thou shalt take this rod in thine hand , wherewith thou shalt do signs .
and the LORD said unto Moses in Midian , Go , return into Egypt : for all the men are dead which sought thy life .
and Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them upon an ass , and he returned to the land of Egypt : and Moses took the rod of God in his hand .
and the taskmasters hasted them , saying , fulfil your works , your daily tasks , as when there was straw .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God : and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God , which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
and Amram took him Jochebed his father 's sister to wife ; and she bare him Aaron and Moses : and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years .
get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning ; lo , he goeth out unto the water ; and thou shalt stand by the river 's brink against he come ; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand .
and the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments : and Pharaoh 's heart was hardened , neither did he hearken unto them ; as the LORD had said .
and the magicians did so with their enchantments , and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt .
and the frogs shall depart from thee , and from thy houses , and from thy servants , and from thy people ; they shall remain in the river only .
and they did so ; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod , and smote the dust of the earth , and it became lice in man , and in beast ; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt .
else , if thou wilt not let my people go , behold , I will send swarms of flies upon thee , and upon thy servants , and upon thy people , and into thy houses : and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies , and also the ground whereon they are .
and Moses said , Behold , I go out from thee , and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh , from his servants , and from his people , to morrow : but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD .
for now I will stretch out my hand , that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence ; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth .
send therefore now , and gather thy cattle , and all that thou hast in the field ; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field , and shall not be brought home , the hail shall come down upon them , and they shall die .
he that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses :
and he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field .
and Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven : and the LORD sent thunder and hail , and the fire ran along upon the ground ; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt .
and Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh , and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD : and the thunders and hail ceased , and the rain was not poured upon the earth .
and Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt , and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day , and all that night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the locusts .
and Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven ; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days :
they saw not one another , neither rose any from his place for three days : but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings .
and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die , from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne , even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill ; and all the firstborn of beasts .
but against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue , against man or beast : that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel .
and Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh : and the LORD hardened Pharaoh 's heart , so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land .
and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop , and dip it in the blood that is in the bason , and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason ; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning .
and ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever .
and the people took their dough before it was leavened , their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders .
unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days ; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee , neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters .
and it shall be for a token upon thine hand , and for frontlets between thine eyes : for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt .
and he made ready his chariot , and took his people with him :
but lift thou up thy rod , and stretch out thine hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea .
and Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyptians fled against it ; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
and in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee : thou sentest forth thy wrath , which consumed them as stubble .
thou stretchedst out thy right hand , the earth swallowed them .
thou shalt bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance , in the place , O LORD , which thou hast made for thee to dwell in , in the Sanctuary , O Lord , which thy hands have established .
see , for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath , therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days ; abide ye every man in his place , let no man go out of his place on the seventh day .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Go on before the people , and take with thee of the elders of Israel ; and thy rod , wherewith thou smotest the river , take in thine hand , and go .
and Jethro , Moses ' father in law , came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness , where he encamped at the mount of God :
and Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel 's sake , and all the travail that had come upon them by the way , and how the LORD delivered them .
and Moses said unto his father in law , Because the people come unto me to inquire of God :
thou wilt surely wear away , both thou , and this people that is with thee : for this thing is too heavy for thee ; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone .
and Moses let his father in law depart ; and he went his way into his own land .
and Moses went down from the mount unto the people , and sanctified the people ; and they washed their clothes .
honour thy father and thy mother : that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee .
ye shall not make with me gods of silver , neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold .
and if he have betrothed her unto his son , he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters .
and if a man lie not in wait , but God deliver him into his hand ; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee .
and if a man smite his servant , or his maid , with a rod , and he die under his hand ; he shall be surely punished .
and if a man smite the eye of his servant , or the eye of his maid , that it perish ; he shall let him go free for his eye 's sake .
if the thief be not found , then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges , to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour 's goods .
then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both , that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour 's goods ; and the owner of it shall accept thereof , and he shall not make it good .
and if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed , and lie with her , he shall surely endow her to be his wife .
thou shalt not revile the gods , nor curse the ruler of thy people .
thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits , and of thy liquors : the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me .
thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread ; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning .
beware of him , and obey his voice , provoke him not ; for he will not pardon your transgressions : for my name is in him .
but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice , and do all that I speak ; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies , and an adversary unto thine adversaries .
I will send my fear before thee , and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come , and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee .
and take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother , and his sons with him , from among the children of Israel , that he may minister unto me in the priest 's office , even Aaron , Nadab and Abihu , Eleazar and Ithamar , Aaron 's sons .
and the curious girdle of the ephod , which is upon it , shall be of the same , according to the work thereof ; even of gold , of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen .
and thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the ephod for stones of memorial unto the children of Israel : and Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD upon his two shoulders for a memorial .
and thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning work ; after the work of the ephod thou shalt make it ; of gold , of blue , and of purple , and of scarlet , and of fine twined linen , shalt thou make it .
and Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his heart , when he goeth in unto the holy place , for a memorial before the LORD continually .
thou shalt also take one ram ; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram .
and thou shalt take the other ram ; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram .
for Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat :
so they shall wash their hands and their feet , that they die not : and it shall be a statute for ever to them , even to him and to his seed throughout their generations .
Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath , to observe the sabbath throughout their generations , for a perpetual covenant .
and all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears , and brought them unto Aaron .
for Moses had said , consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD , even every man upon his son , and upon his brother ; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day .
therefore now go , lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee : behold , mine Angel shall go before thee : nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them .
and when the people heard these evil tidings , they mourned : and no man did put on him his ornaments .
and the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb .
lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land , and they go a whoring after their gods , and do sacrifice unto their gods , and one call thee , and thou eat of his sacrifice ;
and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons , and their daughters go a whoring after their gods , and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods .
for I will cast out the nations before thee , and enlarge thy borders : neither shall any man desire thy land , when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Write thou these words : for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel .
and of the blue , and purple , and scarlet , they made cloths of service , to do service in the holy place , and made the holy garments for Aaron ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
and he made the breastplate of cunning work , like the work of the ephod ; of gold , blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen .
and Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat :
and when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle , the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys :
and he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering ; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him .

if he offer a lamb for his offering , then shall he offer it before the LORD .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation : and Aaron 's sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it , and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation : and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about .

and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat , and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD : it is a sin offering .
or if his sin , which he hath sinned , come to his knowledge : then he shall bring his offering , a kid of the goats , a female without blemish , for his sin which he hath sinned .
and if a soul sin , and hear the voice of swearing , and is a witness , whether he hath seen or known of it ; if he do not utter it , then he shall bear his iniquity .
and if he be not able to bring a lamb , then he shall bring for his trespass , which he hath committed , two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , unto the LORD ; one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering .
and if a soul sin , and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD ; though he wist it not , yet is he guilty , and shall bear his iniquity .
if a soul sin , and commit a trespass against the LORD , and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep , or in fellowship , or in a thing taken away by violence , or hath deceived his neighbour ;
and the priest shall put on his linen garment , and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh , and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar , and he shall put them beside the altar .
and he shall put off his garments , and put on other garments , and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place .
besides the cakes , he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings .
and he brought the ram for the burnt offering : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram .
and he brought the other ram , the ram of consecration : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram .
and there came a fire out from before the LORD , and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat : which when all the people saw , they shouted , and fell on their faces .
and whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even .
and he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even : they are unclean unto you .

and she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days ; she shall touch no hallowed thing , nor come into the sanctuary , until the days of her purifying be fulfilled .
but if she bear a maid child , then she shall be unclean two weeks , as in her separation : and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days .
and the priest shall look on him again the seventh day : and , behold , if the plague be somewhat dark , and the plague spread not in the skin , the priest shall pronounce him clean : it is but a scab : and he shall wash his clothes , and be clean .
and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall : and , behold , if the scall be not spread in the skin , nor be in sight deeper than the skin ; then the priest shall pronounce him clean : and he shall wash his clothes , and be clean .
but it shall be on the seventh day , that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows , even all his hair he shall shave off : and he shall wash his clothes , also he shall wash his flesh in water , and he shall be clean .
and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand , and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD :
and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD :
and he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the issue shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .

and whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
and whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean , and shall wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and be unclean until the even .
thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness ; that they die not in their uncleanness , when they defile my tabernacle that is among them .
and there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place , until he come out , and have made an atonement for himself , and for his household , and for all the congregation of Israel .

and the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited : and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness .
but if he wash them not , nor bathe his flesh ; then he shall bear his iniquity .
that the land spue not you out also , when ye defile it , as it spued out the nations that were before you .
ye shall fear every man his mother , and his father , and keep my sabbaths : I am the LORD your God .
turn ye not unto idols , nor make to yourselves molten gods : I am the LORD your God .
therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity , because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD : and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
and when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field , neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest .
but the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you , and thou shalt love him as thyself ; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt : I am the LORD your God .

ye shall therefore keep all my statutes , and all my judgments , and do them : that the land , whither I bring you to dwell therein , spue you not out .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron , and say unto them , There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people :
and for his sister a virgin , that is nigh unto him , which hath had no husband ; for her may he be defiled .
but he shall not defile himself , being a chief man among his people , to profane himself .
they shall be holy unto their God , and not profane the name of their God : for the offerings of the LORD made by fire , and the bread of their God , they do offer : therefore they shall be holy .
they shall not take a wife that is a whore , or profane ; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband : for he is holy unto his God .
thou shalt sanctify him therefore ; for he offereth the bread of thy God : he shall be holy unto thee : for I the LORD , which sanctify you , am holy .
and he that is the high priest among his brethren , upon whose head the anointing oil was poured , and that is consecrated to put on the garments , shall not uncover his head , nor rend his clothes ;
neither shall he go in to any dead body , nor defile himself for his father , or for his mother ;
neither shall he profane his seed among his people : for I the LORD do sanctify him .
speak unto Aaron , saying , Whosoever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any blemish , let him not approach to offer the bread of his God .
or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing , whereby he may be made unclean , or a man of whom he may take uncleanness , whatsoever uncleanness he hath ;
they shall therefore keep mine ordinance , lest they bear sin for it , and die therefore , if they profane it : I the LORD do sanctify them .
or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass , when they eat their holy things : for I the LORD do sanctify them .
and when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest , neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest : thou shalt leave them unto the poor , and to the stranger : I am the LORD your God .
bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp ; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head , and let all the congregation stone him .
and thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel , saying , Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin .
that which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap , neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed : for it is a year of rest unto the land .
and the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you ; for thee , and for thy servant , and for thy maid , and for thy hired servant , and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee ,
and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee , seven times seven years ; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years .
then let him count the years of the sale thereof , and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it ; that he may return unto his possession .
and if thy brother be waxen poor , and fallen in decay with thee ; then thou shalt relieve him : yea , though he be a stranger , or a sojourner ; that he may live with thee .
but as an hired servant , and as a sojourner , he shall be with thee , and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile :
both thy bondmen , and thy bondmaids , which thou shalt have , shall be of the heathen that are round about you ; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids .
and if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee , and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor , and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee , or to the stock of the stranger 's family :
if there be yet many years behind , according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for .
ye shall make you no idols nor graven image , neither rear you up a standing image , neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land , to bow down unto it : for I am the LORD your God .
and your strength shall be spent in vain : for your land shall not yield her increase , neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits .
then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths , as long as it lieth desolate , and ye be in your enemies ' land ; even then shall the land rest , and enjoy her sabbaths .
if they shall confess their iniquity , and the iniquity of their fathers , with their trespass which they trespassed against me , and that also they have walked contrary unto me ;
and when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD , then the priest shall estimate it , whether it be good or bad : as the priest shall estimate it , so shall it stand .
and if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes , he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof .
every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard , with the ensign of their father 's house : far off about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch .
all they that were numbered in the camp of Dan were an hundred thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred . they shall go hindmost with their standards .
and thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons , and they shall wait on their priest 's office : and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death .
both male and female shall ye put out , without the camp shall ye put them ; that they defile not their camps , in the midst whereof I dwell .
and the priest shall charge her by an oath , and say unto the woman , If no man have lain with thee , and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband , be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse :
all the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree , from the kernels even to the husk .
and if any man die very suddenly by him , and he hath defiled the head of his consecration ; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing , on the seventh day shall he shave it .
the LORD lift up his countenance upon thee , and give thee peace .
he offered for his offering one silver charger , the weight whereof was an hundred and thirty shekels , one silver bowl of seventy shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary ; both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering :
and thus shalt thou do unto them , to cleanse them : sprinkle water of purifying upon them , and let them shave all their flesh , and let them wash their clothes , and so make themselves clean .
and thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD : and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites :
and the Levites were purified , and they washed their clothes ; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD ; and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them .
and after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron , and before his sons : as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so did they unto them .
but shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation , to keep the charge , and shall do no service . thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge .
and the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai ; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran .
then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families , every man in the door of his tent : and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly ; Moses also was displeased .
and Moses said unto him , Enviest thou for my sake ? would God that all the LORD 's people were prophets , and that the LORD would put his spirit upon them !
and the people stood up all that day , and all that night , and all the next day , and they gathered the quails : he that gathered least gathered ten homers : and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp .
and Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married : for he had married an Ethiopian woman .
and he said , Hear now my words : if there be a prophet among you , I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision , and will speak unto him in a dream .
now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man , then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak , saying ,
and the LORD said , I have pardoned according to thy word :
speak unto the children of Israel , and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations , and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue :
and when Moses heard it , he fell upon his face :
and he hath brought thee near to him , and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee : and seek ye the priesthood also ?
and Moses was very wroth , and said unto the LORD , Respect not thou their offering : I have not taken one ass from them , neither have I hurt one of them .
and they fell upon their faces , and said , O God , the God of the spirits of all flesh , shall one man sin , and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation ?
so they Gat up from the tabernacle of Korah , Dathan , and Abiram , on every side : and Dathan and Abiram came out , and stood in the door of their tents , and their wives , and their sons , and their little children .
and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up , and their houses , and all the men that appertained unto Korah , and all their goods .
get you up from among this congregation , that I may consume them as in a moment . and they fell upon their faces .
and the LORD said unto Aaron , Thou and thy sons and thy father 's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary : and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood .
and thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi , the tribe of thy father , bring thou with thee , that they may be joined unto thee , and minister unto thee : but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness .
in the most holy place shalt thou eat it ; every male shall eat it : it shall be holy unto thee .
then the priest shall wash his clothes , and he shall bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be unclean until the even .
and Moses lifted up his hand , and with his rod he smote the rock twice : and the water came out abundantly , and the congregation drank , and their beasts also .
and Edom said unto him , Thou shalt not pass by me , lest I come out against thee with the sword .
Aaron shall be gathered unto his people : for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel , because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah .
and Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border : but Sihon gathered all his people together , and went out against Israel into the wilderness : and he came to Jahaz , and fought against Israel .
and God came unto Balaam , and said , What men are these with thee ?
and God 's anger was kindled because he went : and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him . now he was riding upon his ass , and his two servants were with him .
and Balaam said unto the ass , Because thou hast mocked me : I would there were a sword in mine hand , for now would I kill thee .
then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam , and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and he bowed down his head , and fell flat on his face .
and the angel of the LORD said unto him , Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times ? behold , I went out to withstand thee , because thy way is perverse before me :
and the ass saw me , and turned from me these three times : unless she had turned from me , surely now also I had slain thee , and saved her alive .
and Balaam said unto Balak , Lo , I am come unto thee : have I now any power at all to say any thing ? the word that God putteth in my mouth , that shall I speak .
and he took up his parable , and said , Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram , out of the mountains of the east , saying , Come , curse me Jacob , and come , defy Israel .
and he took up his parable , and said , Rise up , Balak , and hear ; hearken unto me , thou son of Zippor :
and Balak said unto Balaam , Come , I pray thee , I will bring thee unto another place ; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence .
and when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel , he went not , as at other times , to seek for enchantments , but he set his face toward the wilderness .
and he took up his parable , and said , Balaam the son of Beor hath said , and the man whose eyes are open hath said :
and now , behold , I go unto my people : come therefore , and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days .
and he took up his parable , and said , Balaam the son of Beor hath said , and the man whose eyes are open hath said :
and Moses said unto the judges of Israel , Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baal @-@ peor .
and he shall have it , and his seed after him , even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood ; because he was zealous for his God , and made an atonement for the children of Israel .
and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up together with Korah , when that company died , what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men : and they became a sign .
our father died in the wilderness , and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah ; but died in his own sin , and had no sons .
and when thou hast seen it , thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people , as Aaron thy brother was gathered .
if a man vow a vow unto the LORD , or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond ; he shall not break his word , he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth .
if a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD , and bind herself by a bond , being in her father 's house in her youth ;
and her husband heard it , and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it : then her vows shall stand , and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand .
and her husband heard it , and held his peace at her , and disallowed her not : then all her vows shall stand , and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand .
these are the statutes , which the LORD commanded Moses , between a man and his wife , between the father and his daughter , being yet in her youth in her father 's house .
and Moses spake unto the people , saying , Arm some of yourselves unto the war , and let them go against the Midianites , and avenge the LORD of Midian .
but all the women children , that have not known a man by lying with him , keep alive for yourselves .
Wherefore , said they , if we have found grace in thy sight , let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession , and bring us not over Jordan .
and they came near unto him , and said , We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle , and cities for our little ones :
build you cities for your little ones , and folds for your sheep ; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth .
these are the journeys of the children of Israel , which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron .
or in enmity smite him with his hand , that he die : he that smote him shall surely be put to death ; for he is a murderer : the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer , when he meeteth him .
because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession .
this is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad , saying , Let them marry to whom they think best ; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry .
so shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe : for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
for Mahlal , Tirzah , and Hoglah , and Milcah , and Noah , the daughters of Zelophehad , were married unto their father 's brothers ' sons :
and in the wilderness , where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee , as a man doth bear his son , in all the way that ye went , until ye came into this place .
but Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him : for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit , and made his heart obstinate , that he might deliver him into thy hand , as appeareth this day .
only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves , and the spoil of the cities which we took .
then we turned , and went up the way to Bashan : and Og the king of Bashan came out against us , he and all his people , to battle at Edrei .
and the LORD said unto me , Fear him not : for I will deliver him , and all his people , and his land , into thy hand ; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites , which dwelt at Heshbon .
Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi ; and called them after his own name , Bashan @-@ havoth @-@ Jair , unto this day .
thou shalt keep therefore his statutes , and his commandments , which I command thee this day , that it may go well with thee , and with thy children after thee , and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth , which the LORD thy God giveth thee , for ever .
that the slayer might flee thither , which should kill his neighbour unawares , and hated him not in times past ; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live :
honour thy father and thy mother , as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee ; that thy days may be prolonged , and that it may go well with thee , in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee .
that thou mightest fear the LORD thy God , to keep all his statutes and his commandments , which I command thee , thou , and thy son , and thy son 's son , all the days of thy life ; and that thy days may be prolonged .
and these words , which I command thee this day , shall be in thine heart :
and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house , and on thy gates .
neither shalt thou make marriages with them ; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son , nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son .
for they will turn away thy son from following me , that they may serve other gods : so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you , and destroy thee suddenly .
Wherefore it shall come to pass , if ye hearken to these judgments , and keep , and do them , that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers :
and thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee ; thine eye shall have no pity upon them : neither shalt thou serve their gods ; for that will be a snare unto thee .
and he shall deliver their kings into thine hand , and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven : there shall no man be able to stand before thee , until thou have destroyed them .
and thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness , to humble thee , and to prove thee , to know what was in thine heart , whether thou wouldest keep his commandments , or no .
thou shalt also consider in thine heart , that , as a man chasteneth his son , so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee .
who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness , wherein were fiery serpents , and scorpions , and drought , where there was no water ; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint ;
but thou shalt remember the LORD thy God : for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth , that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers , as it is this day .
so I turned and came down from the mount , and the mount burned with fire : and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands .
at that time the LORD said unto me , Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first , and come up unto me into the mount , and make thee an ark of wood .
for the land , whither thou goest in to possess it , is not as the land of Egypt , from whence ye came out , where thou sowedst thy seed , and wateredst it with thy foot , as a garden of herbs :
and I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle , that thou mayest eat and be full .
and thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house , and upon thy gates :
these are the statutes and judgments , which ye shall observe to do in the land , which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it , all the days that ye live upon the earth .
ye shall utterly destroy all the places , wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods , upon the high mountains , and upon the hills , and under every green tree :
take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest :
but in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes , there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings , and there thou shalt do all that I command thee .
when the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border , as he hath promised thee , and thou shalt say , I will eat flesh , because thy soul longeth to eat flesh ; thou mayest eat flesh , whatsoever thy soul lusteth after .
observe and hear all these words which I command thee , that it may go well with thee , and with thy children after thee for ever , when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God .
thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God : for every abomination to the LORD , which he hateth , have they done unto their gods ; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods .
if thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities , which the LORD thy God hath given thee to dwell there , saying ,
and there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand : that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger , and shew thee mercy , and have compassion upon thee , and multiply thee , as he hath sworn unto thy fathers ;
thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed , that the field bringeth forth year by year .
and the Levite that is within thy gates ; thou shalt not forsake him ; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee .
at the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year , and shalt lay it up within thy gates :
and this is the manner of the release : every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it ; he shall not exact it of his neighbour , or of his brother ; because it is called the LORD 's release .
thou shalt surely give him , and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him : because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works , and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto .
for the poor shall never cease out of the land : therefore I command thee , saying , Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother , to thy poor , and to thy needy , in thy land .
and if thy brother , an Hebrew man , or an Hebrew woman , be sold unto thee , and serve thee six years ; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee .
and when thou sendest him out free from thee , thou shalt not let him go away empty :
thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock , and out of thy floor , and out of thy winepress : of that wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him .
and it shall be , if he say unto thee , I will not go away from thee ; because he loveth thee and thine house , because he is well with thee ;
thou shalt eat it within thy gates : the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike , as the Roebuck , and as the hart .
thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days , after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine :
judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates , which the LORD thy God giveth thee , throughout thy tribes : and they shall judge the people with just judgment .
if there be found among you , within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee , man or woman , that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God , in Transgressing his covenant ,
if there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment , between blood and blood , between plea and plea , and between stroke and stroke , being matters of controversy within thy gates : then shalt thou arise , and get thee up into the place which the LORD thy God shall choose ;
and the man that will do presumptuously , and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy God , or unto the judge , even that man shall die : and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel .
thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee , whom the LORD thy God shall choose : one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee : thou mayest not set a stranger over thee , which is not thy brother .
and it shall be with him , and he shall read therein all the days of his life : that he may learn to fear the LORD his God , to keep all the words of this law and these statutes , to do them :
then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God , as all his brethren the Levites do , which stand there before the LORD .
thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God .
thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land , which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it .
and this is the case of the slayer , which shall flee thither , that he may live : whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly , whom he hated not in time past ;
and if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast , as he hath sworn unto thy fathers , and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers ;
that innocent blood be not shed in thy land , which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance , and so blood be upon thee .
thou shalt not remove thy neighbour 's landmark , which they of old time have set in thine inheritance , which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it .
and the officers shall speak unto the people , saying , What man is there that hath built a new house , and hath not dedicated it ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man dedicate it .
and what man is he that hath planted a vineyard , and hath not yet eaten of it ? let him also go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man eat of it .
and what man is there that hath betrothed a wife , and hath not taken her ? let him go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her .
and the officers shall speak further unto the people , and they shall say , What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted ? let him go and return unto his house , lest his brethren 's heart faint as well as his heart .
and when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands , thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword :
that they teach you not to do after all their abominations , which they have done unto their gods ; so should ye sin against the LORD your God .
and all the elders of that city , that are next unto the slain man , shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley :
and seest among the captives a beautiful woman , and hast a desire unto her , that thou wouldest have her to thy wife ;
then thou shalt bring her home to thine house ; and she shall shave her head , and pare her nails ;
if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son , which will not obey the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and that , when they have chastened him , will not hearken unto them :
the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man , neither shall a man put on a woman 's garment : for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God .
when thou buildest a new house , then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof , that thou bring not blood upon thine house , if any man fall from thence .
thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds : lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown , and the fruit of thy vineyard , be defiled .
thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture , wherewith thou coverest thyself .
but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing ; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death : for as when a man riseth against his neighbour , and slayeth him , even so is this matter :
then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel 's father fifty shekels of silver , and she shall be his wife ; because he hath humbled her , he may not put her away all his days .
when the host goeth forth against thine enemies , then keep thee from every wicked thing .
thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee :
thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore , or the price of a dog , into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow : for even both these are abomination unto the LORD thy God .
thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother ; usury of money , usury of victuals , usury of any thing that is lent upon usury :
unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury ; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury : that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it .
and if the latter husband hate her , and write her a bill of divorcement , and giveth it in her hand , and sendeth her out of his house ; or if the latter husband die , which took her to be his wife ;
when thou dost lend thy brother any thing , thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge .
thou shalt stand abroad , and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee .
in any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down , that he may sleep in his own raiment , and bless thee : and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God .
thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy , whether he be of thy brethren , or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates :
when thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field , and hast forgot a sheaf in the field , thou shalt not go again to fetch it : it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow : that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands .
when thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard , thou shalt not glean it afterward : it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
but thou shalt have a perfect and just weight , a perfect and just measure shalt thou have : that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee .
therefore it shall be , when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about , in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it , that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven ; thou shalt not forget it .
and now , behold , I have brought the firstfruits of the land , which thou , O LORD , hast given me . and thou shalt set it before the LORD thy God , and worship before the LORD thy God :
and thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy God hath given unto thee , and unto thine house , thou , and the Levite , and the stranger that is among you .
look down from thy holy habitation , from heaven , and bless thy people Israel , and the land which thou hast given us , as thou swarest unto our fathers , a land that floweth with milk and honey .
this day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments : thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart , and with all thy soul .
thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones : and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD thy God :
and thou shalt offer peace offerings , and shalt eat there , and rejoice before the LORD thy God .
cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother . and all the people shall say , Amen .
cursed be he that removeth his neighbour 's landmark . and all the people shall say , Amen .
cursed be he that lieth with his sister , the daughter of his father , or the daughter of his mother . and all the people shall say , Amen .
cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour secretly . and all the people shall say , Amen .
and all these blessings shall come on thee , and overtake thee , if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God .
blessed shall be the fruit of thy body , and the fruit of thy ground , and the fruit of thy cattle , the increase of thy kine , and the flocks of thy sheep .
the LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face : they shall come out against thee one way , and flee before thee seven ways .
the LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses , and in all that thou settest thine hand unto ; and he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee .
but it shall come to pass , if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day ; that all these curses shall come upon thee , and overtake thee :
the LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee , until he have consumed thee from off the land , whither thou goest to possess it .
thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes , and thou shalt not eat thereof : thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face , and shall not be restored to thee : thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies , and thou shalt have none to rescue them .
the fruit of thy land , and all thy labours , shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up ; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway :
the LORD shall smite thee in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore botch that CANNOT be healed , from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head .
the LORD shall bring thee , and thy king which thou shalt set over thee , unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known ; and there shalt thou serve other gods , wood and stone .
thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts , but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil ; for thine olive shall cast his fruit .
thou shalt beget sons and daughters , but thou shalt not enjoy them ; for they shall go into captivity .
moreover all these curses shall come upon thee , and shall pursue thee , and overtake thee , till thou be destroyed ; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee :
therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee , in hunger , and in thirst , and in nakedness , and in want of all things : and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck , until he have destroyed thee .
and thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body , the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters , which the LORD thy God hath given thee , in the siege , and in the straitness , wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee :
so that the man that is tender among you , and very delicate , his eye shall be evil toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bosom , and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave :
so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat : because he hath nothing left him in the siege , and in the straitness , wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates .
and among these nations shalt thou find no ease , neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest : but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and sorrow of mind :
your little ones , your wives , and thy stranger that is in thy camp , from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water :
and it shall come to pass , when all these things are come upon thee , the blessing and the curse , which I have set before thee , and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations , whither the LORD thy God hath driven thee ,
and shalt return unto the LORD thy God , and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day , thou and thy children , with all thine heart , and with all thy soul ;
and the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed , and thou shalt possess it ; and he will do thee good , and multiply thee above thy fathers .
it is not in heaven , that thou shouldest say , Who shall go up for us to heaven , and bring it unto us , that we may hear it , and do it ?
but the word is very nigh unto thee , in thy mouth , and in thy heart , that thou mayest do it .
gather the people together , men , and women , and children , and thy stranger that is within thy gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear the LORD your God , and observe to do all the words of this law :
and I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought , in that they are turned unto other gods .
see now that I , even I , am he , and there is no god with me : I kill , and I make alive ; I wound , and I heal : neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand .
because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah @-@ Kadesh , in the wilderness of Zin ; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel .
yet thou shalt see the land before thee ; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel .
yea , he loved the people ; all his saints are in thy hand : and they sat down at thy feet ; every one shall receive of thy words .
and of Zebulun he said , Rejoice , Zebulun , in thy going out ; and , Issachar , in thy tents .
and of Asher he said , Let Asher be blessed with children ; let him be acceptable to his brethren , and let him dip his foot in oil .
Israel then shall dwell in safety alone : the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine ; also his heavens shall drop down dew .
happy art thou , O Israel : who is like unto thee , O people saved by the LORD , the shield of thy help , and who is the sword of thy excellency ! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee ; and thou shalt tread upon their high places .
there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life : as I was with Moses , so I will be with thee : I will not fail thee , nor forsake thee .
this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth ; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night , that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein : for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous , and then thou shalt have good success .
whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment , and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him , he shall be put to death : only be strong and of a good courage .
and as soon as we had heard these things , our hearts did melt , neither did there remain any more courage in any man , because of you : for the LORD your God , he is God in heaven above , and in earth beneath .
and as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan , and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water , ( for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest , )
at that time the LORD said unto Joshua , Make thee sharp knives , and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time .
and he said , Nay ; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come . and Joshua fell on his face to the earth , and did worship , and said unto him , What saith my lord unto his servant ?
and Joshua rent his clothes , and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide , he and the elders of Israel , and put dust upon their heads .
therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies , but turned their backs before their enemies , because they were accursed : neither will I be with you any more , except ye destroy the accursed from among you .
up , sanctify the people , and say , Sanctify yourselves against to morrow : for thus saith the LORD God of Israel , There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee , O Israel : thou canst not stand before thine enemies , until ye take away the accursed thing from among you .
and the LORD said unto Joshua , Fear not , neither be thou dismayed : take all the people of war with thee , and arise , go up to Ai : see , I have given into thy hand the king of Ai , and his people , and his city , and his land :
and the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand : and they entered into the city , and took it , and hasted and set the city on fire .
for Joshua drew not his hand back , wherewith he stretched out the spear , until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai .
only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves , according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua .
they did work wilily , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old sacks upon their asses , and wine bottles , old , and rent , and bound up ;
and the LORD said unto Joshua , Fear them not : for I have delivered them into thine hand ; there shall not a man of them stand before thee .
and all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace : none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel .
with whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance , which Moses gave them , beyond Jordan eastward , even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them ;
nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt : but I wholly followed the LORD my God .
and Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph , even to Ephraim and to Manasseh , saying , Thou art a great people , and hast great power : thou shalt not have one lot only :
give out from among you three men for each tribe : and I will send them , and they shall rise , and go through the land , and describe it according to the inheritance of them ; and they shall come again to me .
and they shall divide it into seven parts : Judah shall abide in their coast on the south , and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north .
and the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance , at the commandment of the LORD , these cities and their suburbs .
and said unto them , Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you , and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you :
ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day , but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God .
so Joshua blessed them , and sent them away : and they went unto their tents .
and Joshua said unto the people , Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD , to serve him . and they said , We are witnesses .
and Adoni @-@ Bezek said , threescore and ten kings , having their thumbs and their great toes cut off , gathered their meat under my table : as I have done , so God hath requited me . and they brought him to Jerusalem , and there he died .
and they took their daughters to be their wives , and gave their daughters to their sons , and served their gods .
and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD , and forgat the LORD their God , and served Baalim and the groves .
and he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek , and went and smote Israel , and possessed the city of palm trees .
but Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges , of a cubit length ; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh .
but he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal , and said , I have a secret errand unto thee , O king : who said , Keep silence . and all that stood by him went out from him .
and Ehud came unto him ; and he was sitting in a summer parlour , which he had for himself alone . and Ehud said , I have a message from God unto thee . and he arose out of his seat .
and Ehud put forth his left hand , and took the dagger from his right thigh , and thrust it into his belly :
and she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim : and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment .
and Sisera gathered together all his chariots , even nine hundred chariots of iron , and all the people that were with him , from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon .
awake , awake , Deborah : awake , awake , utter a song : arise , Barak , and lead thy captivity captive , thou son of Abinoam .
Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field .
for they came up with their cattle and their tents , and they came as grasshoppers for multitude ; for both they and their camels were without number : and they entered into the land to destroy it .
and the LORD looked upon him , and said , Go in this thy might , and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites : have not I sent thee ?
depart not hence , I pray thee , until I come unto thee , and bring forth my present , and set it before thee . and he said , I will tarry until thou come again .
so the people took victuals in their hand , and their trumpets : and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent , and retained those three hundred men : and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley .
and he came unto the men of Succoth , and said , Behold Zebah and Zalmunna , with whom ye did upbraid me , saying , Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand , that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary ?
thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel , so that they lifted up their heads no more . and the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon .
and he went unto his father 's house at Ophrah , and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal , being threescore and ten persons , upon one stone : notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left ; for he hid himself .
and when they told it to Jotham , he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim , and lifted up his voice , and cried , and said unto them , hearken unto me , ye men of Shechem , that God may hearken unto you .
and the bramble said unto the trees , If in truth ye anoint me king over you , then come and put your trust in my shadow : and if not , let fire come out of the bramble , and devour the cedars of Lebanon .
and Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren , and went over to Shechem : and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him .
and he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily , saying , Behold , Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem ; and , behold , they fortify the city against thee .
and they put away the strange gods from among them , and served the LORD : and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel .
then Jephthah fled from his brethren , and dwelt in the land of Tob : and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah , and went out with him .
and the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah , The LORD be witness between us , if we do not so according to thy words .
then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead , and the people made him head and captain over them : and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh .
but Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast : but Sihon gathered all his people together , and pitched in Jahaz , and fought against Israel .
and Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house , and , behold , his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances : and she was his only child ; beside her he had neither son nor daughter .
and he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines : now therefore get her for me to wife .
then went Samson down , and his father and his mother , to Timnath , and came to the vineyards of Timnath : and , behold , a young lion roared against him .
and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him , and he rent him as he would have rent a kid , and he had nothing in his hand : but he told not his father or his mother what he had done .
and he found a new jawbone of an ass , and put forth his hand , and took it , and slew a thousand men therewith .
and he was sore athirst , and called on the LORD , and said , Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant : and now shall I die for thirst , and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised ?
and the man Micah had an house of gods , and made an ephod , and teraphim , and consecrated one of his sons , who became his priest .
and they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol : and their brethren said unto them , What say ye ?
and he said , Ye have taken away my gods which I made , and the priest , and ye are gone away : and what have I more ? and what is this that ye say unto me , What aileth thee ?
and the children of Dan went their way : and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him , he turned and went back unto his house .
and the children of Dan set up the graven image : and Jonathan , the son of Gershom , the son of Manasseh , he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land .
and they set them up Micah 's graven image , which he made , all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh .
and , behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at even , which was also of mount Ephraim ; and he sojourned in Gibeah : but the men of the place were Benjamites .
yet there is both straw and provender for our asses ; and there is bread and wine also for me , and for thy handmaid , and for the young man which is with thy servants : there is no want of any thing .
so he brought him into his house , and gave provender unto the asses : and they washed their feet , and did eat and drink .
and all the people arose as one man , saying , We will not any of us go to his tent , neither will we any of us turn into his house .
and the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother , and said , There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day .
and the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wives , according to their number , of them that danced , whom they caught : and they went and returned unto their inheritance , and repaired the cities , and dwelt in them .
and the children of Israel departed thence at that time , every man to his tribe and to his family , and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance .
and Naomi said unto her two daughters in law , Go , return each to her mother 's house : the LORD deal kindly with you , as ye have dealt with the dead , and with me .
and she said , Behold , thy sister in law is gone back unto her people , and unto her gods : return thou after thy sister in law .
then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers , Whose damsel is this ?
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said unto him , Why have I found grace in thine eyes , that thou shouldest take knowledge of me , seeing I am a stranger ?
and she took it up , and went into the city : and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned : and she brought forth , and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed .
and she said , These six measures of barley gave he me ; for he said to me , Go not empty unto thy mother in law .
and the kinsman said , I CANNOT redeem it for myself , lest I mar mine own inheritance : redeem thou my right to thyself ; for I CANNOT redeem it .
now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing , for to confirm all things ; a man plucked off his shoe , and gave it to his neighbour : and this was a testimony in Israel .
therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz , Buy it for thee . so he drew off his shoe .
and this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh . and the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , the priests of the LORD , were there .
then said Elkanah her husband to her , Hannah , why weepest thou ? and why eatest thou not ? and why is thy heart grieved ? am not I better to thee than ten sons ?
now Hannah , she spake in her heart ; only her lips moved , but her voice was not heard : therefore Eli thought she had been drunken .
count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial : for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto .
and she said , Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight . so the woman went her way , and did eat , and her countenance was no more sad .
and they rose up in the morning early , and worshipped before the LORD , and returned , and came to their house to Ramah : and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife ; and the LORD remembered her .
there is none holy as the LORD : for there is none beside thee : neither is there any rock like our God .
and he struck it into the pan , or kettle , or caldron , or pot ; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself . so they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither .
moreover his mother made him a little coat , and brought it to him from year to year , when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice .
behold , the days come , that I will cut off thine arm , and the arm of thy father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in thine house .
and I will raise me up a faithful priest , that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind : and I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever .
and when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow , behold , Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD . and they took Dagon , and set him in his place again .
and Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life .
and he said , This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them for himself , for his chariots , and to be his horsemen ; and some shall run before his chariots .
and he will appoint him captains over thousands , and captains over fifties ; and will set them to ear his ground , and to reap his harvest , and to make his instruments of war , and instruments of his chariots .
and he will take the tenth of your seed , and of your vineyards , and give to his officers , and to his servants .
and the asses of Kish Saul 's father were lost . and Kish said to Saul his son , Take now one of the servants with thee , and arise , go seek the asses .
and when Samuel saw Saul , the LORD said unto him , Behold the man whom I spake to thee of ! this same shall reign over my people .
and Samuel answered Saul , and said , I am the seer : go up before me unto the high place ; for ye shall eat with me to day , and to morrow I will let thee go , and will tell thee all that is in thine heart .
and Samuel said unto the cook , Bring the portion which I gave thee , of which I said unto thee , Set it by thee .
and Saul said unto his uncle , He told us plainly that the asses were found . but of the matter of the kingdom , whereof Samuel spake , he told him not .
and they ran and fetched him thence : and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward .
and Saul also went home to Gibeah ; and there went with him a band of men , whose hearts God had touched .
and now , behold , the king walketh before you : and I am old and grayheaded ; and , behold , my sons are with you : and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day .
and when they forgat the LORD their God , he sold them into the hand of Sisera , captain of the host of Hazor , and into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the king of Moab , and they fought against them .
and all the people said unto Samuel , Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God , that we die not : for we have added unto all our sins this evil , to ask us a king .
for , as the LORD liveth , which saveth Israel , though it be in Jonathan my son , he shall surely die . but there was not a man among all the people that answered him .
then said he unto all Israel , Be ye on one side , and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side . and the people said unto Saul , Do what seemeth good unto thee .
and there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul : and when Saul saw any strong man , or any valiant man , he took him unto him .
and Saul said , They have brought them from the Amalekites : for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen , to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God ; and the rest we have utterly destroyed .
and Samuel said , When thou wast little in thine own sight , wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel , and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel ?
then he said , I have sinned : yet honour me now , I pray thee , before the elders of my people , and before Israel , and turn again with me , that I may worship the LORD thy God .
and Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death : nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul : and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel .
let our lord now command thy servants , which are before thee , to seek out a man , who is a cunning player on an harp : and it shall come to pass , when the evil spirit from God is upon thee , that he shall play with his hand , and thou shalt be well .
and Saul sent to Jesse , saying , Let David , I pray thee , stand before me ; for he hath found favour in my sight .
now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle , and were gathered together at Shochoh , which belongeth to Judah , and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah , in Ephes @-@ dammim .
but David went and returned from Saul to feed his father 's sheep at Bethlehem .
and David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage , and ran into the army , and came and saluted his brethren .
and David said unto Saul , Thy servant kept his father 's sheep , and there came a lion , and a bear , and took a lamb out of the flock :
and David put his hand in his bag , and took thence a stone , and slang it , and smote the Philistine in his forehead , that the stone sunk into his forehead ; and he fell upon his face to the earth .
and David took the head of the Philistine , and brought it to Jerusalem ; but he put his armour in his tent .
and Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him , and gave it to David , and his garments , even to his sword , and to his bow , and to his girdle .
therefore Saul removed him from him , and made him his captain over a thousand ; and he went out and came in before the people .
and Saul commanded his servants , saying , Commune with David secretly , and say , Behold , the king hath delight in thee , and all his servants love thee : now therefore be the king 's son in law .
and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art , and I will commune with my father of thee ; and what I see , that I will tell thee .
and Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father , and said unto him , Let not the king sin against his servant , against David ; because he hath not sinned against thee , and because his works have been to theeward very good :
Saul also sent messengers unto David 's house , to watch him , and to slay him in the morning : and Michal David 's wife told him , saying , If thou save not thy life to night , to morrow thou shalt be slain .
and Saul said unto Michal , Why hast thou deceived me so , and sent away mine enemy , that he is escaped ? and Michal answered Saul , He said unto me , Let me go ; why should I kill thee ?
and he stripped off his clothes also , and prophesied before Samuel in like manner , and lay down naked all that day and all that night . Wherefore they say , Is Saul also among the prophets ?
and David fled from Naioth in Ramah , and came and said before Jonathan , What have I done ? what is mine iniquity ? and what is my sin before thy father , that he seeketh my life ?
then said Jonathan unto David , whatsoever thy soul desireth , I will even do it for thee .
but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever : no , not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth .
and when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot , Jonathan cried after the lad , and said , Is not the arrow beyond thee ?
and as soon as the lad was gone , David arose out of a place toward the south , and fell on his face to the ground , and bowed himself three times : and they kissed one another , and wept one with another , until David exceeded .
and David said unto Ahimelech , And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword ? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me , because the king 's business required haste .
and David laid up these words in his heart , and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath .
then said Achish unto his servants , Lo , ye see the man is mad : Wherefore then have ye brought him to me ?
then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him , Hear now , ye Benjamites ; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards , and make you all captains of thousands , and captains of hundreds ;
and they two made a covenant before the LORD : and David abode in the wood , and Jonathan went to his house .
so David stayed his servants with these words , and suffered them not to rise against Saul . but Saul rose up out of the cave , and went on his way .
swear now therefore unto me by the LORD , that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me , and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father 's house .
and David sware unto Saul . and Saul went home ; but David and his men Gat them up unto the hold .
and there was a man in Maon , whose possessions were in Carmel ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand sheep , and a thousand goats : and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel .
and David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep .
and Nabal answered David 's servants , and said , Who is David ? and who is the son of Jesse ? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master .
and David said unto his men , Gird ye on every man his sword . and they girded on every man his sword ; and David also girded on his sword : and there went up after David about four hundred men ; and two hundred abode by the stuff .
and when Abigail saw David , she hasted , and lighted off the ass , and fell before David on her face , and bowed herself to the ground ,
I pray thee , forgive the trespass of thine handmaid : for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house ; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD , and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days .
and blessed be thy advice , and blessed be thou , which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood , and from avenging myself with mine own hand .
the LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness : for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day , but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD 's anointed .
and , behold , as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes , so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD , and let him deliver me out of all tribulation .
and David said to Achish , Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do . and Achish said to David , Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever .
now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek : and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel .
and David said to Abiathar the priest , Ahimelech 's son , I pray thee , bring me hither the ephod . and Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David .
and they cut off his head , and stripped off his armour , and sent into the land of the Philistines round about , to publish it in the house of their idols , and among the people .
then David took hold on his clothes , and rent them ; and likewise all the men that were with him :
therefore now let your hands be strengthened , and be ye valiant : for your master Saul is dead , and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them .
and Joab said , As God liveth , unless thou hadst spoken , surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother .
and Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf , saying , Whose is the land ? saying also , Make thy league with me , and , behold , my hand shall be with thee , to bring about all Israel unto thee .
in Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months : and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah .
and when they came to Nachon 's threshingfloor , Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God , and took hold of it ; for the oxen shook it .
so David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David : but David carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ Edom the Gittite .
and as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David , Michal Saul 's daughter looked through a window , and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD ; and she despised him in her heart .
and David said unto Michal , It was before the LORD , which chose me before thy father , and before all his house , to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD , over Israel : therefore will I play before the LORD .
and as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel , and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies . also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house .
and when thy days be fulfilled , and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers , I will set up thy seed after thee , which shall proceed out of thy bowels , and I will establish his kingdom .
but my mercy shall not depart away from him , as I took it from Saul , whom I put away before thee .
Wherefore thou art great , O LORD God : for there is none like thee , neither is there any God beside thee , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
now when Mephibosheth , the son of Jonathan , the son of Saul , was come unto David , he fell on his face , and did reverence . and David said , Mephibosheth . and he answered , Behold thy servant !
and it came to pass , after the year was expired , at the time when kings go forth to battle , that David sent Joab , and his servants with him , and all Israel ; and they destroyed the children of Ammon , and besieged Rabbah . but David tarried still at Jerusalem .
and David sent messengers , and took her ; and she came in unto him , and he lay with her ; for she was purified from her uncleanness : and she returned unto her house .
and David said to Uriah , Go down to thy house , and wash thy feet . and Uriah departed out of the king 's house , and there followed him a mess of meat from the king .
and when David had called him , he did eat and drink before him ; and he made him drunk : and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord , but went not down to his house .
and the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants ; and some of the king 's servants be dead , and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also .
and when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead , she mourned for her husband .
but when David saw that his servants whispered , David perceived that the child was dead : therefore David said unto his servants , Is the child dead ? and they said , He is dead .
and David comforted Bath @-@ sheba his wife , and went in unto her , and lay with her : and she bare a son , and he called his name Solomon : and the LORD loved him .
then Amnon hated her exceedingly ; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her . and Amnon said unto her , Arise , be gone .
then he called his servant that ministered unto him , and said , Put now this woman out from me , and bolt the door after her .
and Tamar put ashes on her head , and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her , and laid her hand on her head , and went on crying .
and Absalom came to the king , and said , Behold now , thy servant hath sheepshearers ; let the king , I beseech thee , and his servants go with thy servant .
and the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded . then all the king 's sons arose , and every man Gat him up upon his mule , and fled .
but Absalom fled , and went to Talmai , the son of Ammihud , king of Geshur . and David mourned for his son every day .
and when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king , she fell on her face to the ground , and did obeisance , and said , Help , O king .
and the king said , Whosoever saith ought unto thee , bring him to me , and he shall not touch thee any more .
for the king will hear , to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God .
and the king said unto Joab , Behold now , I have done this thing : go therefore , bring the young man Absalom again .
so Joab came to the king , and told him : and when he had called for Absalom , he came to the king , and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king kissed Absalom .
and the king went forth , and all his household after him . and the king left ten women , which were concubines , to keep the house .
whereas thou camest but yesterday , should I this day make thee go up and down with us ? seeing I go whither I may , return thou , and take back thy brethren : mercy and truth be with thee .
and David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet , and wept as he went up , and had his head covered , and he went barefoot : and all the people that was with him covered every man his head , and they went up , weeping as they went up .
the LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul , in whose stead thou hast reigned ; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son : and , behold , thou art taken in thy mischief , because thou art a bloody man .
and David said to Abishai , and to all his servants , Behold , my son , which came forth of my bowels , seeketh my life : how much more now may this Benjamite do it ? let him alone , and let him curse ; for the LORD hath bidden him .
and when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed , he saddled his ass , and arose , and Gat him home to his house , to his city , and put his household in order , and hanged himself , and died , and was buried in the sepulchre of his father .
and there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul , and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went over Jordan before the king .
for all of my father 's house were but dead men before my lord the king : yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table . what right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king ?
and the king answered , Chimham shall go over with me , and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee : and whatsoever thou shalt require of me , that will I do for thee .
and all the people went over Jordan . and when the king was come over , the king kissed Barzillai , and blessed him ; and he returned unto his own place .
the LORD thundered from heaven , and the most High uttered his voice .
the LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness : according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me .
therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness ; according to my cleanness in his eye sight .
therefore I will give thanks unto thee , O LORD , among the heathen , and I will sing praises unto thy name .
and Abishai , the brother of Joab , the son of Zeruiah , was chief among three . and he lifted up his spear against three hundred , and slew them , and had the name among three .
go and say unto David , Thus saith the LORD , I offer thee three things ; choose thee one of them , that I may do it unto thee .
and Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth , which is by En @-@ rogel , and called all his brethren the king 's sons , and all the men of Judah the king 's servants :
but Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah , and the mighty men , and Solomon his brother , he called not .
go and get thee in unto king David , and say unto him , didst not thou , my lord , O king , swear unto thine handmaid , saying , Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne ? why then doth Adonijah reign ?
and moreover the king 's servants came to bless our lord king David , saying , God make the name of Solomon better than thy name , and make his throne greater than thy throne . and the king bowed himself upon the bed .
so king Solomon sent , and they brought him down from the altar . and he came and bowed himself to king Solomon : and Solomon said unto him , Go to thine house .
so David slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of David .
so Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up , and fell upon him , and slew him : and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness .
and Shimei arose , and saddled his ass , and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants : and Shimei went , and brought his servants from Gath .
the king said moreover to Shimei , Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to , that thou didst to David my father : therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head ;
give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people , that I may discern between good and bad : for who is able to judge this thy so great a people ?
and God said unto him , Because thou hast asked this thing , and hast not asked for thyself long life ; neither hast asked riches for thyself , nor hast asked the life of thine enemies ; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment ;
behold , I have done according to thy words : lo , I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart ; so that there was none like thee before thee , neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee .
and I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked , both riches , and honour : so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days .
and she arose at midnight , and took my son from beside me , while thine handmaid slept , and laid it in her bosom , and laid her dead child in my bosom .
and Judah and Israel dwelt safely , every man under his vine and under his fig tree , from Dan even to Beer @-@ sheba , all the days of Solomon .
and Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon ; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father : for Hiram was ever a lover of David .
thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side , until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet .
and , behold , I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God , as the LORD spake unto David my father , saying , Thy son , whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room , he shall build an house unto my name .
and he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month by courses : a month they were in Lebanon , and two months at home : and Adoniram was over the levy .
but Solomon was building his own house thirteen years , and he finished all his house .
and his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch , which was of the like work . Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh 's daughter , whom he had taken to wife , like unto this porch .
for he cast two pillars of brass , of eighteen cubits high apiece : and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about .
and Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heaven :
and he said , LORD God of Israel , there is no God like thee , in heaven above , or on earth beneath , who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart :
and hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant , and of thy people Israel , when they shall pray toward this place : and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place : and when thou hearest , forgive .
then hear thou in heaven , and do , and judge thy servants , condemning the wicked , to bring his way upon his head ; and justifying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
when heaven is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sinned against thee ; if they pray toward this place , and confess thy name , and turn from their sin , when thou afflictest them :
if thy people go out to battle against their enemy , whithersoever thou shalt send them , and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen , and toward the house that I have built for thy name :
for thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth , to be thine inheritance , as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant , when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt , O Lord GOD .
that he may incline our hearts unto him , to walk in all his ways , and to keep his commandments , and his statutes , and his judgments , which he commanded our fathers .
on the eighth day he sent the people away : and they blessed the king , and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant , and for Israel his people .
then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have hallowed for my name , will I cast out of my sight ; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people :
for Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Gezer , and burnt it with fire , and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city , and given it for a present unto his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
and Hiram sent in the navy his servants , shipmen that had knowledge of the sea , with the servants of Solomon .
and she said to the king , It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom .
happy are thy men , happy are these thy servants , which stand continually before thee , and that hear thy wisdom .
and they brought every man his present , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and garments , and armour , and spices , horses , and mules , a rate year by year .
and likewise did he for all his strange wives , which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods .
and the LORD was angry with Solomon , because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel , which had appeared unto him twice ,
Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon , forasmuch as this is done of thee , and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes , which I have commanded thee , I will surely rend the kingdom from thee , and will give it to thy servant .
and when hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers , and that Joab the captain of the host was dead , hadad said to Pharaoh , Let me depart , that I may go to mine own country .
and he gathered men unto him , and became captain over a band , when David slew them of Zobah : and they went to Damascus , and dwelt therein , and reigned in Damascus .
and unto his son will I give one tribe , that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem , the city which I have chosen me to put my name there .
and Solomon slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of David his father : and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead .
and Jeroboam said in his heart , Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David :
now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel ; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel : the words which he had spoken unto the king , them they told also to their father .
but camest back , and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place , of the which the LORD did say to thee , Eat no bread , and drink no water ; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers .
and take with thee ten loaves , and cracknels , and a cruse of honey , and go to him : he shall tell thee what shall become of the child .
and rent the kingdom away from the house of David , and gave it thee : and yet thou hast not been as my servant David , who kept my commandments , and who followed me with all his heart , to do that only which was right in mine eyes ;
but hast done evil above all that were before thee : for thou hast gone and made thee other gods , and molten images , to provoke me to anger , and hast cast me behind thy back :
and Rehoboam slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David . and his mother 's name was Naamah an Ammonitess . and Abijam his son reigned in his stead .
and he walked in all the sins of his father , which he had done before him : and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God , as the heart of David his father .
so Ben @-@ hadad hearkened unto king Asa , and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel , and smote Ijon , and Dan , and Abel @-@ Beth @-@ maachah , and all Cinneroth , with all the land of Naphtali .
and he did evil in the sight of the LORD , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin .
and the woman said to Elijah , Now by this I know that thou art a man of God , and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth .
and as Obadiah was in the way , behold , Elijah met him : and he knew him , and fell on his face , and said , Art thou that my lord Elijah ?
and Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal , Choose you one bullock for yourselves , and dress it first ; for ye are many ; and call on the name of your gods , but put no fire under .
so Ahab went up to eat and to drink . and Elijah went up to the top of Carmel ; and he cast himself down upon the earth , and put his face between his knees ,
and when he saw that , he arose , and went for his life , and came to Beer @-@ sheba , which belongeth to Judah , and left his servant there .
and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over Israel : and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel @-@ meholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room .
and the messengers came again , and said , Thus speaketh Ben @-@ hadad , saying , Although I have sent unto thee , saying , Thou shalt deliver me thy silver , and thy gold , and thy wives , and thy children ;
behold , I will bring evil upon thee , and will take away thy posterity , and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in Israel ,
and will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah , for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger , and made Israel to sin .
and the king of Israel said unto his servants , Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours , and we be still , and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria ?
now therefore , behold , the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets , and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee .
and the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat , I will disguise myself , and enter into the battle ; but put thou on thy robes . and the king of Israel disguised himself , and went into the battle .
and Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria , and was sick : and he sent messengers , and said unto them , Go , inquire of Baal @-@ zebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease .
and they answered him , He was an hairy man , and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins . and he said , It is Elijah the Tishbite .
behold , there came fire down from heaven , and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties : therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight .
and Elijah took his mantle , and wrapped it together , and smote the waters , and they were divided hither and thither , so that they two went over on dry ground .
and Elisha saw it , and he cried , My father , my father , the chariot of Israel , and the horsemen thereof . and he saw him no more : and he took hold of his own clothes , and rent them in two pieces .
and they said , This is blood : the kings are surely slain , and they have smitten one another : now therefore , Moab , to the spoil .
and when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him , he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords , to break through even unto the king of Edom : but they could not .
then he said , Go , borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours , even empty vessels ; borrow not a few .
so she went from him , and shut the door upon her and upon her sons , who brought the vessels to her ; and she poured out .
and she said unto her husband , Behold now , I perceive that this is an holy man of God , which passeth by us continually .
then she said , Did I desire a son of my lord ? did I not say , Do not deceive me ?
he went in therefore , and shut the door upon them twain , and prayed unto the LORD .
then she went in , and fell at his feet , and bowed herself to the ground , and took up her son , and went out .
and one went out into the field to gather herbs , and found a wild vine , and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full , and came and shred them into the pot of pottage : for they knew them not .
and she said unto her mistress , Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria ! for he would recover him of his leprosy .
and one went in , and told his lord , saying , Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel .
and the king of Syria said , Go to , go , and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel . and he departed , and took with him ten talents of silver , and six thousand pieces of gold , and ten changes of raiment .
and it was so , when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes , that he sent to the king , saying , Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel .
and Elisha sent a messenger unto him , saying , Go and wash in the Jordan seven times , and thy flesh shall come again to thee , and thou shalt be clean .
but Naaman was wroth , and went away , and said , Behold , I thought , He will surely come out to me , and stand , and call on the name of the LORD his God , and strike his hand over the place , and recover the leper .
so Gehazi followed after Naaman . and when Naaman saw him running after him , he lighted down from the chariot to meet him , and said , Is all well ?
but he went in , and stood before his master . and Elisha said unto him , whence comest thou , Gehazi ? and he said , Thy servant went no whither .
therefore said he , Take it up to thee . and he put out his hand , and took it .
therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing ; and he called his servants , and said unto them , Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel ?
Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight , and left their tents , and their horses , and their asses , even the camp as it was , and fled for their life .
and they went after them unto Jordan : and , lo , all the way was full of garments and vessels , which the Syrians had cast away in their haste . and the messengers returned , and told the king .
so Joram went over to Zair , and all the chariots with him : and he rose by night , and smote the Edomites which compassed him about , and the captains of the chariots : and the people fled into their tents .
and Joram slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David : and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead .
and Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets , and said unto him , Gird up thy loins , and take this box of oil in thine hand , and go to Ramoth @-@ Gilead :
and when he came , behold , the captains of the host were sitting ; and he said , I have an errand to thee , O captain . and Jehu said , Unto which of all us ? and he said , To thee , O captain .
and Jehu drew a bow with his full strength , and smote Jehoram between his arms , and the arrow went out at his heart , and he sunk down in his chariot .
and when Jehu was come to Jezreel , Jezebel heard of it ; and she painted her face , and tired her head , and looked out at a window .
and he lifted up his face to the window , and said , Who is on my side ? who ? and there looked out to him two or three eunuchs .
look even out the best and meetest of your master 's sons , and set him on his father 's throne , and fight for your master 's house .
and the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds , with the captains and the guard , and brought them to him into the house of the LORD , and made a covenant with them , and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD , and shewed them the king 's son .
and the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , round about the king , from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple , along by the altar and the temple .
and Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him .
then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest , and the other priests , and said unto them , Why repair ye not the breaches of the house ? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance , but deliver it for the breaches of the house .
( and the LORD gave Israel a saviour , so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians : and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents , as beforetime .
and he said to the king of Israel , Put thine hand upon the bow . and he put his hand upon it : and Elisha put his hands upon the king 's hands .
and the LORD was gracious unto them , and had compassion on them , and had respect unto them , because of his covenant with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and would not destroy them , neither cast he them from his presence as yet .
thou hast indeed smitten Edom , and thine heart hath lifted thee up : glory of this , and tarry at home : for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt , that thou shouldest fall , even thou , and Judah with thee ?
he built Elath , and restored it to Judah , after that the king slept with his fathers .
and Jeroboam slept with his fathers , even with the kings of Israel ; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD : he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
but Pekah the son of Remaliah , a captain of his , conspired against him , and smote him in Samaria , in the palace of the king 's house , with Argob and Arieh , and with him fifty men of the Gileadites : and he killed him , and reigned in his room .
and Jotham slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father : and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead .
and he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering , and poured his drink offering , and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings , upon the altar .
for so it was , that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God , which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt , from under the hand of Pharoah king of Egypt , and had feared other gods ,
and they set them up images and groves in every high hill , and under every green tree :
notwithstanding they would not hear , but hardened their necks , like to the neck of their fathers , that did not believe in the LORD their God .
and they left all the commandments of the LORD their God , and made them molten images , even two calves , and made a grove , and worshipped all the host of heaven , and served Baal .
and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire , and used divination and enchantments , and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD , to provoke him to anger .
therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel , and removed them out of his sight : there was none left but the tribe of Judah only .
until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight , as he had said by all his servants the prophets . so was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day .
and the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak , and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech , the gods of Sepharvaim .
so they feared the LORD , and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places , which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places .
then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , and Shebna , and Joah , unto Rab @-@ shakeh , Speak , I pray thee , to thy servants in the Syrian language ; for we understand it : and talk not with us in the Jews ' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall .
hearken not to Hezekiah : for thus saith the king of Assyria , Make an agreement with me by a present , and come out to me , and then eat ye every man of his own vine , and every one of his fig tree , and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern :
who are they among all the gods of the countries , that have delivered their country out of mine hand , that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand ?
for I will defend this city , to save it , for mine own sake , and for my servant David 's sake .
then he turned his face to the wall , and prayed unto the LORD , saying ,
turn again , and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people , Thus saith the LORD , the God of David thy father , I have heard thy prayer , I have seen thy tears : behold , I will heal thee : on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD .
and I will add unto thy days fifteen years ; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria ; and I will defend this city for mine own sake , and for my servant David 's sake .
and he said , What have they seen in thine house ? and Hezekiah answered , All the things that are in mine house have they seen : there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them .
and of thy sons that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt beget , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon .
and he made his son pass through the fire , and observed times , and used enchantments , and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards : he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD , to provoke him to anger .
because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations , and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did , which were before him , and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols :
and he defiled Topheth , which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom , that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech .
for through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah , until he had cast them out from his presence , that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon .
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came , he , and all his host , against Jerusalem , and pitched against it ; and they built forts against it round about .
and they transgressed against the God of their fathers , and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land , whom God destroyed before them .
so all Israel were reckoned by genealogies ; and , behold , they were written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah , who were carried away to Babylon for their transgression .
now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in their cities were , the Israelites , the priests , Levites , and the Nethinims .
and their brethren , which were in their villages , were to come after seven days from time to time with them .
and these are the singers , chief of the fathers of the Levites , who remaining in the chambers were free : for they were employed in that work day and night .
then said Saul to his armourbearer , Draw thy sword , and thrust me through therewith ; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me . but his armourbearer would not ; for he was sore afraid . so Saul took a sword , and fell upon it .
and when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , then they forsook their cities , and fled : and the Philistines came and dwelt in them .
and Abishai the brother of Joab , he was chief of the three : for lifting up his spear against three hundred , he slew them , and had a name among the three .
and let us bring again the ark of our God to us : for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul .
and when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon , Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark ; for the oxen stumbled .
and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza , and he smote him , because he put his hand to the ark : and there he died before God .
so they came up to Baal @-@ perazim ; and David smote them there . then David said , God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters : therefore they called the name of that place Baal @-@ perazim .
and when they had left their gods there , David gave a commandment , and they were burned with fire .
and it came to pass , as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David , that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing : and she despised him in her heart .
saying , Touch not mine anointed , and do my prophets no harm .
and it shall come to pass , when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers , that I will raise up thy seed after thee , which shall be of thy sons ; and I will establish his kingdom .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son : and I will not take my mercy away from him , as I took it from him that was before thee :
O LORD , for thy servant 's sake , and according to thine own heart , hast thou done all this greatness , in making known all these great things .
O LORD , there is none like thee , neither is there any God beside thee , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
and David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath , as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates .
so Gad came to David , and said unto him , Thus saith the LORD , Choose thee
and David lifted up his eyes , and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven , having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem . then David and the elders of Israel , who were clothed in sackcloth , fell upon their faces .
and Eleazar died , and had no sons , but daughters : and their brethren the sons of Kish took them .
and of all my sons , ( for the LORD hath given me many sons , ) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel .
thine , O LORD , is the greatness , and the power , and the glory , and the victory , and the majesty : for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine ; thine is the kingdom , O LORD , and thou art exalted as head above all .
but who am I , and what is my people , that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort ? for all things come of thee , and of thine own have we given thee .
O LORD our God , all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand , and is all thine own .
and give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep thy commandments , thy testimonies , and thy statutes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for the which I have made provision .
and David said to all the congregation , Now bless the LORD your God . and all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers , and bowed down their heads , and worshipped the LORD , and the king .
wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee ; and I will give thee riches , and wealth , and honour , such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee , neither shall there any after thee have the like .
then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing , which he sent to Solomon , Because the LORD hath loved his people , he hath made thee king over them .
Huram said moreover , Blessed be the LORD God of Israel , that made heaven and earth , who hath given to David the king a wise son , endued with prudence and understanding , that might build an house for the LORD , and an house for his kingdom .
now therefore the wheat , and the barley , the oil , and the wine , which my lord hath spoken of , let him send unto his servants :
the wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits : and they stood on their feet , and their faces were inward .
and the king turned his face , and blessed the whole congregation of Israel : and all the congregation of Israel stood .
but the LORD said to David my father , forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name , thou didst well in that it was in thine heart :
for Solomon had made a brasen scaffold , of five cubits long , and five cubits broad , and three cubits high , and had set it in the midst of the court : and upon it he stood , and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heaven ,
and said , O LORD God of Israel , there is no God like thee in the heaven , nor in the earth ; which keepest covenant , and shewest mercy unto thy servants , that walk before thee with all their hearts :
when the heaven is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sinned against thee ; yet if they pray toward this place , and confess thy name , and turn from their sin , when thou dost afflict them ;
moreover concerning the stranger , which is not of thy people Israel , but is come from a far country for thy great name 's sake , and thy mighty hand , and thy stretched out arm ; if they come and pray in this house ;
if thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them , and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen , and the house which I have built for thy name ;
then hear thou from the heavens , even from thy dwelling place , their prayer and their supplications , and maintain their cause , and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee .
now mine eyes shall be open , and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place .
and as for thee , if thou wilt walk before me , as David thy father walked , and do according to all that I have commanded thee , and shalt observe my statues and my judgments ;
then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have sanctified for my name , will I cast out of my sight , and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations .
and the meat of his table , and the sitting of his servants , and the attendance of his ministers , and their apparel ; his cupbearers also , and their apparel ; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD ; there was no more spirit in her .
and she said to the king , It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts , and of thy wisdom :
happy are thy men , and happy are these thy servants , which stand continually before thee , and hear thy wisdom .
and king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire , whatsoever she asked , beside that which she had brought unto the king . so she turned , and went away to her own land , she and her servants .
and they brought every man his present , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and raiment , harness , and spices , horses , and mules , a rate year by year .
thus saith the LORD , Ye shall not go up , nor fight against your brethren : return every man to his house : for this thing is done of me . and they obeyed the words of the LORD , and returned from going against Jeroboam .
for the Levites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to Judah and Jerusalem : for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest 's office unto the LORD :
and Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines : ( for he took eighteen wives , and threescore concubines ; and begat twenty and eight sons , and threescore daughters . )
and he did evil , because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD .
thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time , and the children of Judah prevailed , because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers .
and commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers , and to do the law and the commandment .
but when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel , and sought him , he was found of them .
and they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul ;
were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host , with very many chariots and horsemen ? yet , because thou didst rely on the LORD , he delivered them into thine hand .
but sought to the LORD God of his father , and walked in his commandments , and not after the doings of Israel .
then he said , I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains , as sheep that have no shepherd : and the LORD said , These have no master ; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace .
now therefore , behold , the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets , and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee .
and the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat , I will disguise myself , and will go to the battle ; but put thou on thy robes . so the king of Israel disguised himself ; and they went to the battle .
and a certain man drew a bow at a venture , and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness : therefore he said to his chariot man , Turn thine hand , that thou mayest carry me out of the host ; for I am wounded .
and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem .
nevertheless there are good things found in thee , in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land , and hast prepared thine heart to seek God .
Howbeit the high places were not taken away : for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers .
now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David . and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead .
so the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day . the same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand ; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers .
behold , with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people , and thy children , and thy wives , and all thy goods :
and Jehoiada made a covenant between him , and between all the people , and between the king , that they should be the LORD 's people .
and they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers , and served groves and idols : and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass .
now it came to pass , when the kingdom was established to him , that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father .
Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah , and he sent unto him a prophet , which said unto him , Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people , which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand ?
but when he was strong , his heart was lifted up to his destruction : for he transgressed against the LORD his God , and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense .
moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom , and burnt his children in the fire , after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel .
for Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day , which were all valiant men ; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers .
and the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand , women , sons , and daughters , and took also away much spoil from them , and brought the spoil to Samaria .
and now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you : but are there not with you , even with you , sins against the LORD your God ?
and in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD : this is that king Ahaz .
and they stood in their place after their manner , according to the law of Moses the man of God : the priests sprinkled the blood , which they received of the hand of the Levites .
and in every work that he began in the service of the house of God , and in the law , and in the commandments , to seek his God , he did it with all his heart , and prospered .
after these things , and the establishment thereof , Sennacherib king of Assyria came , and entered into Judah , and encamped against the fenced cities , and thought to win them for himself .
he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city : and they did help him .
and he set captains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city , and spake comfortably to them , saying ,
know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands ? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand ?
who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of mine hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand ?
notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah .
and Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour : and he made himself treasuries for silver , and for gold , and for precious stones , and for spices , and for shields , and for all manner of pleasant jewels ;
this same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon , and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David . and Hezekiah prospered in all his works .
and when he was in affliction , he besought the LORD his God , and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers ,
nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places , yet unto the LORD their God only .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , and walked in the ways of David his father , and declined neither to the right hand , nor to the left .
behold , I will gather thee to thy fathers , and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace , neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place , and upon the inhabitants of the same . so they brought the king word again .
so the service was prepared , and the priests stood in their place , and the Levites in their courses , according to the king 's commandment .
and afterward they made ready for themselves , and for the priests : because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night ; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves , and for the priests the sons of Aaron .
Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God .
and he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar , who had made him swear by God : but he stiffened his neck , and hardened his heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel .
all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred . all these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem .
and these were they which went up from Tel @-@ melah , Tel @-@ harsa , cherub , Addan , and Immer : but they could not shew their father 's house , and their seed , whether they were of Israel :
so the priests , and the Levites , and some of the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the Nethinims , dwelt in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
for the priests and the Levites were purified together , all of them were pure , and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity , and for their brethren the priests , and for themselves .
for Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD , and to do it , and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments .
then I proclaimed a fast there , at the river of Ahava , that we might afflict ourselves before our God , to seek of him a right way for us , and for our little ones , and for all our substance .
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves , and for their sons : so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands : yea , the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass .
and at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness ; and having rent my garment and my mantle , I fell upon my knees , and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God .
and said , O my God , I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee , my God : for our iniquities are increased over our head , and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens .
should we again break thy commandments , and join in affinity with the people of these abominations ? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us , so that there should be no remnant nor escaping ?
and they gave their hands that they would put away their wives ; and being guilty , they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass .
all these had taken strange wives : and some of them had wives by whom they had children .
that Hanani , one of my brethren , came , he and certain men of Judah ; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped , which were left of the captivity , and concerning Jerusalem .
and said , I beseech thee , O LORD God of heaven , the great and terrible God , that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments :
and said unto the king , Let the king live for ever : why should not my countenance be sad , when the city , the place of my fathers ' sepulchres , lieth waste , and the gates thereof are consumed with fire ?
then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me ; as also the king 's words that he had spoken unto me . and they said , Let us rise up and build . so they strengthened their hands for this good work .
and next unto them the Tekoites repaired ; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their Lord .
for the builders , every one had his sword girded by his side , and so builded . and he that sounded the trumpet was by me .
likewise at the same time said I unto the people , Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem , that in the night they may be a guard to us , and labour on the day .
some also there were that said , We have mortgaged our lands , vineyards , and houses , that we might buy corn , because of the dearth .
and it came to pass , that when all our enemies heard thereof , and all the heathen that were about us saw these things , they were much cast down in their own eyes : for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God .
for there were many in Judah sworn unto him , because he was the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah ; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah .
and Ezra blessed the LORD , the great God . and all the people answered , Amen , Amen , with lifting up their hands : and they bowed their heads , and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground .
so the people went forth , and brought them , and made themselves booths , every one upon the roof of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of the house of God , and in the street of the water gate , and in the street of the gate of Ephraim .
and the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers , and stood and confessed their sins , and the iniquities of their fathers .
thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them , and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth , and gavest them water for their thirst .
nevertheless they were disobedient , and rebelled against thee , and cast thy law behind their backs , and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee , and they wrought great provocations .
and that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land , nor take their daughters for our sons :
also we made ordinances for us , to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God ;
now these are the chief of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem : but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his possession in their cities , to wit , Israel , the priests , and the Levites , and the Nethinims , and the children of Solomon 's servants .
and of the Levites were divisions in Judah , and in Benjamin .
remember me , O my God , concerning this , and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God , and for the offices thereof .
and one of the sons of Joiada , the son of Eliashib the high priest , was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite : therefore I chased him from me .
that in those days , when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom , which was in Shushan the palace ,
in the third year of his reign , he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants ; the power of Persia and Media , the nobles and princes of the provinces , being before him :
when he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days , even an hundred and fourscore days .
and when these days were expired , the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace , both unto great and small , seven days , in the court of the garden of the king 's palace ;
for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women , so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes , when it shall be reported , The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him , but she came not .
and when the king 's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire , ( for it is great , ) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour , both to great and small .
Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people ; as Mordecai had charged her : for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai , like as when she was brought up with him .
when Mordecai perceived all that was done , Mordecai rent his clothes , and put on sackcloth with ashes , and went out into the midst of the city , and cried with a loud and a bitter cry ;
so Esther 's maids and her Chamberlains came and told it her . then was the queen exceedingly grieved ; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai , and to take away his sackcloth from him : but he received it not .
nevertheless Haman refrained himself : and when he came home , he sent and called for his friends , and Zeresh his wife .
and Haman told them of the glory of his riches , and the multitude of his children , and all the things wherein the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
so Haman came in . and the king said unto him , What shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour ? now Haman thought in his heart , To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself ?
and Mordecai came again to the king 's gate . but Haman hasted to his house mourning , and having his head covered .
then Esther the queen answered and said , If I have found favour in thy sight , O king , and if it please the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request :
and the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden : and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen ; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king .
and the king took off his ring , which he had taken from Haman , and gave it unto Mordecai . and Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman .
for how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people ? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred ?
then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew , Behold , I have given Esther the house of Haman , and him they have hanged upon the gallows , because he laid his hand upon the Jews .
the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people , and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies .
thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword , and slaughter , and destruction , and did what they would unto those that hated them .
to stablish this among them , that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar , and the fifteenth day of the same , yearly ,
to confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed , according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them , and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed , the matters of the fastings and their cry .
while he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother 's house :
then Job arose , and rent his mantle , and shaved his head , and fell down upon the ground , and worshipped ,
and he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal ; and he sat down among the ashes .
and when they lifted up their eyes afar off , and knew him not , they lifted up their voice , and wept ; and they rent every one his mantle , and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven .
because it shut not up the doors of my mother 's womb , nor hid sorrow from mine eyes .
with kings and counsellers of the earth , which built desolate places for themselves ;
but now it is come upon thee , and thou faintest ; it toucheth thee , and thou art troubled .
is not this thy fear , thy confidence , thy hope , and the uprightness of thy ways ?
behold , he put no trust in his servants ; and his angels he charged with folly :
so the poor hath hope , and iniquity stoppeth her mouth .
and thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace ; and thou shalt visit thy habitation , and shalt not sin .
lo this , we have searched it , so it is ; hear it , and know thou it for thy good .
what time they wax warm , they vanish : when it is hot , they are consumed out of their place .
the paths of their way are turned aside ; they go to nothing , and perish .
so that my soul chooseth strangling , and death rather than my life .
I have sinned ; what shall I do unto thee , O thou preserver of men ? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee , so that I am a burden to myself ?
whilst it is yet in his greenness , and not cut down , it withereth before any other herb .
till he fill thy mouth with laughing , and thy lips with rejoicing .
which removeth the mountains , and they know not : which overturneth them in his anger .
whom , though I were righteous , yet would I not answer , but I would make supplication to my judge .
if I justify myself , mine own mouth shall condemn me : if I say , I am perfect , it shall also prove me perverse .
I am afraid of all my sorrows , I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent .
neither is there any daysman betwixt us , that might lay his hand upon us both .
then would I speak , and not fear him ; but it is not so with me .
is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress , that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands , and shine upon the counsel of the wicked ?
and these things hast thou hid in thine heart : I know that this is with thee .
if I be wicked , woe unto me ; and if I be righteous , yet will I not lift up my head . I am full of confusion ; therefore see thou mine affliction ;
if iniquity be in thine hand , put it far away , and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles .
I am as one mocked of his neighbour , who calleth upon God , and he answereth him : the just upright man is laughed to scorn .
the tabernacles of robbers prosper , and they that provoke God are secure ; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly .
only do not two things unto me : then will I not hide myself from thee .
for thou writest bitter things against me , and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth .
seeing his days are determined , the number of his months are with thee , thou hast appointed his bounds that he CANNOT pass ;
thou shalt call , and I will answer thee : thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands .
for now thou numberest my steps : dost thou not watch over my sin ?
thine own mouth condemneth thee , and not I : yea , thine own lips testify against thee .
hast thou heard the secret of God ? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself ?
that thou turnest thy spirit against God , and lettest such words go out of thy mouth ?
behold , he putteth no trust in his saints ; yea , the heavens are not clean in his sight .
which wise men have told from their fathers , and have not hid it :
for he stretcheth out his hand against God , and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty .
he runneth upon him , even on his neck , upon the thick bosses of his bucklers :
because he covereth his face with his fatness , and maketh collops of fat on his flanks .
he shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine , and shall cast off his flower as the olive .
I also could speak as ye do : if your soul were in my soul 's stead , I could heap up words against you , and shake mine head at you .
O that one might plead for a man with God , as a man pleadeth for his neighbour !
he that speaketh flattery to his friends , even the eyes of his children shall fail .
he teareth himself in his anger : shall the earth be forsaken for thee ? and shall the rock be removed out of his place ?
my bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh , and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth .
though he spare it , and forsake it not ; but keep it still within his mouth :
yet his meat in his bowels is turned , it is the gall of asps within him .
surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly , he shall not save of that which he desired .
for what pleasure hath he in his house after him , when the number of his months is cut off in the midst ?
therefore snares are round about thee , and sudden fear troubleth thee ;
thou shalt make thy prayer unto him , and he shall hear thee , and thou shalt pay thy vows .
thou shalt also decree a thing , and it shall be established unto thee : and the light shall shine upon thy ways .
even to day is my complaint bitter : my stroke is heavier than my groaning .
some remove the landmarks ; they violently take away flocks , and feed thereof .
in the dark they dig through houses , which they had marked for themselves in the daytime : they know not the light .
dominion and fear are with him , he maketh peace in his high places .
moreover Job continued his parable , and said ,
he buildeth his house as a moth , and as a booth that the keeper maketh .
moreover Job continued his parable , and said ,
the princes refrained talking , and laid their hand on their mouth .
then I said , I shall die in my nest , and I shall multiply my days as the sand .
my root was spread out by the waters , and the dew lay all night upon my branch .
after my words they spake not again ; and my speech dropped upon them .
they abhor me , they flee far from me , and spare not to spit in my face .
because he hath loosed my cord , and afflicted me , they have also let loose the bridle before me .
Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave , though they cry in his destruction .
if his loins have not blessed me , and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep ;
I said , Days should speak , and multitude of years should teach wisdom .
behold , my terror shall not make thee afraid , neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee .
he is chastened also with pain upon his bed , and the multitude of his bones with strong pain :
his flesh shall be fresher than a child 's : he shall return to the days of his youth :
if now thou hast understanding , hear this : hearken to the voice of my words .
should it be according to thy mind ? he will recompense it , whether thou refuse , or whether thou choose ; and not I : therefore speak what thou knowest .
therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain ; he multiplieth words without knowledge .
if they obey and serve him , they shall spend their days in prosperity , and their years in pleasures .
and said , Hitherto shalt thou come , but no further : and here shall thy proud waves be stayed ?
will the unicorn be willing to serve thee , or abide by thy crib ?
she is hardened against her young ones , as though they were not hers : her labour is in vain without fear ;
doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom , and stretch her wings toward the south ?
doth the eagle mount up at thy command , and make her nest on high ?
wilt thou also disannul my judgment ? wilt thou condemn me , that thou mayest be righteous ?
deck thyself now with majesty and excellency ; and array thyself with glory and beauty .
canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook ? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down ?
will he make a covenant with thee ? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever ?
lay thine hand upon him , remember the battle , do no more .
the flakes of his flesh are joined together : they are firm in themselves ; they CANNOT be moved .
he maketh a path to shine after him ; one would think the deep to be hoary .
hear , I beseech thee , and I will speak : I will demand of thee , and declare thou unto me .
after this lived Job an hundred and forty years , and saw his sons , and his sons ' sons , even four generations .
and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water , that bringeth forth his fruit in his season ; his leaf also shall not wither ; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper .
let us break their bands asunder , and cast away their cords from us .
arise , O LORD ; save me , O my God : for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone ; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly .
but know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself : the LORD will hear when I call unto him .
for thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness : neither shall evil dwell with thee .
the foolish shall not stand in thy sight : thou hatest all workers of iniquity .
lead me , O LORD , in thy righteousness because of mine enemies ; make thy way straight before my face .
destroy thou them , O God ; let them fall by their own counsels ; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions ; for they have rebelled against thee .
but let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice : let them ever shout for joy , because thou defendest them : let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee .
for in death there is no remembrance of thee : in the grave who shall give thee thanks ?
mine eye is consumed because of grief ; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies .
arise , O LORD , in thine anger , lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies : and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded .
so shall the congregation of the people compass thee about : for their sakes therefore return thou on high .
the LORD shall judge the people : judge me , O LORD , according to my righteousness , and according to mine integrity that is in me .
I will be glad and rejoice in thee : I will sing praise to thy name , O thou most High .
when mine enemies are turned back , they shall fall and perish at thy presence .
and they that know thy name will put their trust in thee : for thou , LORD , hast not forsaken them that seek thee .
for the wicked boasteth of his heart 's desire , and blesseth the covetous , whom the LORD abhorreth .
he lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den : he lieth in wait to catch the poor : he doth catch the poor , when he draweth him into his net .
in the LORD put I my trust : how say ye to my soul , Flee as a bird to your mountain ?
but I have trusted in thy mercy ; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation .
I will sing unto the LORD , because he hath dealt bountifully with me .
Lord , who shall abide in thy tabernacle ? who shall dwell in thy holy hill ?
he that backbiteth not with his tongue , nor doeth evil to his neighbour , nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour .
he that putteth not out his money to usury , nor taketh reward against the innocent . he that doeth these things shall never be moved .
O my soul , thou hast said unto the LORD , Thou art my Lord : my goodness extendeth not to thee ;
the LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup : thou maintainest my lot .
for thou wilt not leave my soul in hell ; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption .
thou has proved mine heart ; thou hast visited me in the night ; thou has tried me , and shalt find nothing ; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress .
shew thy marvellous lovingkindness , O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them .
from the wicked that oppress me , from my deadly enemies , who compass me about .
they are inclosed in their own fat : with their mouth they speak proudly .
arise , O LORD , disappoint him , cast him down : deliver my soul from the wicked , which is thy sword :
as for me , I will behold thy face in righteousness : I shall be satisfied , when I awake , with thy likeness .
the LORD is my rock , and my fortress , and my deliverer ; my God , my strength , in whom I will trust ; my Buckler , and the horn of my salvation , and my high tower .
he made darkness his secret place ; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies .
then the channels of waters were seen , and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke , O LORD , at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils .
the LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness ; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me .
for I have kept the ways of the LORD , and have not wickedly departed from my God .
therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness , according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight .
the strangers shall fade away , and be afraid out of their close places .
he delivereth me from mine enemies : yea , thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me : thou hast delivered me from the violent man .
which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber , and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race .
who can understand his errors ? cleanse thou me from secret faults .
remember all thy offerings , and accept thy burnt sacrifice ; Selah .
now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed ; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand .
they are brought down and fallen : but we are risen , and stand upright .
he asked life of thee , and thou gavest it him , even length of days for ever and ever .
thine hand shall find out all thine enemies : thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee .
thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger : the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath , and the fire shall devour them .
for they intended evil against thee : they imagined a mischievous device , which they are not able to perform .
therefore shalt thou make them turn their back , when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them .
they gaped upon me with their mouths , as a ravening and a roaring lion .
they part my garments among them , and cast lots upon my vesture .
I will declare thy name unto my brethren : in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee .
all they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship : all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him : and none can keep alive his own soul .
this is the generation of them that seek him , that seek thy face , O Jacob . Selah .
yea , let none that wait on thee be ashamed : let them be ashamed which transgress without cause .
remember not the sins of my youth , nor my transgressions : according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness ' sake , O LORD .
consider mine enemies ; for they are many ; and they hate me with cruel hatred .
for thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes : and I have walked in thy truth .
Lord , I have loved the habitation of thy house , and the place where thine honour dwelleth .
gather not my soul with sinners , nor my life with bloody men :
the LORD is my light and my salvation ; whom shall I fear ? the LORD is the strength of my life ; of whom shall I be afraid ?
for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion : in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me ; he shall set me up upon a rock .
when thou saidst , Seek ye my face ; my heart said unto thee , Thy face , LORD , will I seek .
hide not thy face far from me ; put not thy servant away in anger : thou hast been my help ; leave me not , neither forsake me , O God of my salvation .
teach me thy way , O LORD , and lead me in a plain path , because of mine enemies .
hear the voice of my supplications , when I cry unto thee , when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle .
I cried to thee , O LORD ; and unto the LORD I made supplication .
what profit is there in my blood , when I go down to the pit ? shall the dust praise thee ? shall it declare thy truth ?
I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy : for thou hast considered my trouble ; thou hast known my soul in adversities ;
I was a reproach among all mine enemies , but especially among my neighbours , and a fear to mine acquaintance : they that did see me without fled from me .
my times are in thy hand : deliver me from the hand of mine enemies , and from them that persecute me .
make thy face to shine upon thy servant : save me for thy mercies ' sake .
Oh how great is thy goodness , which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee ; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men !
thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man : thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues .
when I kept silence , my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long .
let thy mercy , O LORD , be upon us , according as we hope in thee .
keep thy tongue from evil , and thy lips from speaking guile .
for without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit , which without cause they have digged for my soul .
stir up thyself , and awake to my judgment , even unto my cause , my God and my Lord .
let them shout for joy , and be glad , that favour my righteous cause : yea , let them say continually , Let the LORD be magnified , which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant .
and my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long .
for with thee is the fountain of life : in thy light shall we see light .
O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee ; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart .
the wicked have drawn out the sword , and have bent their bow , to cast down the poor and needy , and to slay such as be of upright conversation .
there is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger ; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin .
for my loins are filled with a loathsome disease : and there is no soundness in my flesh .
Lord , all my desire is before thee ; and my groaning is not hid from thee .
my lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore ; and my kinsmen stand afar off .
my heart was hot within me , while I was musing the fire burned : then spake I with my tongue ,
and now , Lord , what wait I for ? my hope is in thee .
remove thy stroke away from me : I am consumed by the blow of thine hand .
hear my prayer , O LORD , and give ear unto my cry ; hold not thy peace at my tears : for I am a stranger with thee , and a sojourner , as all my fathers were .
and he hath put a new song in my mouth , even praise unto our God : many shall see it , and fear , and shall trust in the LORD .
blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust , and respecteth not the proud , nor such as turn aside to lies .
I delight to do thy will , O my God : yea , thy law is within my heart .
I have preached righteousness in the great congregation : lo , I have not refrained my lips , O LORD , thou knowest .
I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart ; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation : I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation .
for innumerable evils have compassed me about : mine iniquities have taken hold upon me , so that I am not able to look up ; they are more than the hairs of mine head : therefore my heart faileth me .
let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee : let such as love thy salvation say continually , The LORD be magnified .
and if he come to see me , he speaketh vanity : his heart gathereth iniquity to itself ; when he goeth abroad , he telleth it .
all that hate me whisper together against me : against me do they devise my hurt .
all this is come upon us ; yet have we not forgotten thee , neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant .
thou LOVEST righteousness , and hatest wickedness : therefore God , thy God , hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows .
kings ' daughters were among thy honourable women : upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir .
so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty : for he is thy Lord ; and worship thou him .
I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations : therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever .
God reigneth over the heathen : God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness .
my mouth shall speak of wisdom ; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding .
they that trust in their wealth , and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches ;
though while he lived he blessed his soul : and men will praise thee , when thou doest well to thyself .
I will take no bullock out of thy house , nor he goats out of thy folds .
but unto the wicked God saith , What hast thou to do to declare my statutes , or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth ?
seeing thou hatest instruction , and castest my words behind thee .
thou givest thy mouth to evil , and thy tongue frameth deceit .
whoso offereth praise glorifieth me : and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God .
hide thy face from my sins , and blot out all mine iniquities .
restore unto me the joy of thy salvation ; and uphold me with thy free spirit .
O Lord , open thou my lips ; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise .
lo , this is the man that made not God his strength ; but trusted in the abundance of his riches , and strengthened himself in his wickedness .
for strangers are risen up against me , and oppressors seek after my soul : they have not set God before them . Selah .
he hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him : he hath broken his covenant .
but thou , O God , shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction : bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days ; but I will trust in thee .
what time I am afraid , I will trust in thee .
shall they escape by iniquity ? in thine anger cast down the people , O God .
thou tellest my wanderings : put thou my tears into thy bottle : are they not in thy book ?
their poison is like the poison of a serpent : they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear ;
the righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance : he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked .
the God of my mercy shall prevent me : God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies .
for the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride : and for cursing and lying which they speak .
unto thee , O my strength , will I sing : for God is my defence , and the God of my mercy .
Gilead is mine , and Manasseh is mine ; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head ; Judah is my lawgiver ;
so will I sing praise unto thy name for ever , that I may daily perform my vows .
in God is my salvation and my glory : the rock of my strength , and my refuge , is in God .
thus will I bless thee while I live : I will lift up my hands in thy name .
who whet their tongue like a sword , and bend their bows to shoot their arrows , even bitter words :
that they may shoot in secret at the perfect : suddenly do they shoot at him , and fear not .
so they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves : all that see them shall flee away .
blessed is the man whom thou choosest , and causest to approach unto thee , that he may dwell in thy courts : we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house , even of thy holy temple .
which my lips have uttered , and my mouth hath spoken , when I was in trouble .
then shall the earth yield her increase ; and God , even our own God , shall bless us .
but God shall wound the head of his enemies , and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses .
that thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies , and the tongue of thy dogs in the same .
because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee .
princes shall come out of Egypt ; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God .
O God , thou knowest my foolishness ; and my sins are not hid from thee .
let not them that wait on thee , O Lord GOD of hosts , be ashamed for my sake : let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake , O God of Israel .
because for thy sake I have borne reproach ; shame hath covered my face .
for the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up ; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me .
I made sackcloth also my garment ; and I became a proverb to them .
but as for me , my prayer is unto thee , O LORD , in an acceptable time : O God , in the multitude of thy mercy hear me , in the truth of thy salvation .
and hide not thy face from thy servant ; for I am in trouble : hear me speedily .
draw nigh unto my soul , and redeem it : deliver me because of mine enemies .
add iniquity unto their iniquity : and let them not come into thy righteousness .
let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul : let them be turned backward , and put to confusion , that desire my hurt .
let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee : and let such as love thy salvation say continually , Let God be magnified .
for mine enemies speak against me ; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together ,
let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul ; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt .
O God , thou hast taught me from my youth : and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works .
but as for me , my feet were almost gone ; my steps had well nigh slipped .
they set their mouth against the heavens , and their tongue walketh through the earth .
if I say , I will speak thus ; behold , I should offend against the generation of thy children .
for , lo , they that are far from thee shall perish : thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee .
but it is good for me to draw near to God : I have put my trust in the Lord GOD , that I may declare all thy works .
remember thy congregation , which thou hast purchased of old ; the rod of thine inheritance , which thou hast redeemed ; this mount Zion , wherein thou hast dwelt .
thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations ; they set up their ensigns for signs .
they said in their hearts , Let us destroy them together : they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land .
forget not the voice of thine enemies : the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually .
the stouthearted are spoiled , they have slept their sleep : and none of the men of might have found their hands .
thou , even thou , art to be feared : and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry ?
thou holdest mine eyes waking : I am so troubled that I CANNOT speak .
I will meditate also of all thy work , and talk of thy doings .
the voice of thy thunder was in the heaven : the lightnings lightened the world : the earth trembled and shook .
that they might set their hope in God , and not forget the works of God , but keep his commandments :
and might not be as their fathers , a stubborn and rebellious generation ; a generation that set not their heart aright , and whose spirit was not stedfast with God .
and they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust .
he caused an east wind to blow in the heaven : and by his power he brought in the south wind .
nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth , and they lied unto him with their tongues .
but he , being full of compassion , forgave their iniquity , and destroyed them not : yea , many a time turned he his anger away , and did not stir up all his wrath .
for they provoked him to anger with their high places , and moved him to jealousy with their graven images .
so he fed them according to the integrity of his heart ; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands .
pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee , and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name .
so we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever : we will shew forth thy praise to all generations .
so will not we go back from thee : quicken us , and we will call upon thy name .
for they have consulted together with one consent : they are confederate against thee :
yea , the sparrow hath found an house , and the swallow a nest for herself , where she may lay her young , even thine altars , O LORD of hosts , my King , and my God .
for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand . I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God , than to dwell in the tents of wickedness .
O LORD of hosts , blessed is the man that trusteth in thee .
righteousness shall go before him ; and shall set us in the way of his steps .
preserve my soul ; for I am holy : O thou my God , save thy servant that trusteth in thee .
in the day of my trouble I will call upon thee : for thou wilt answer me .
O God , the proud are risen against me , and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul ; and have not set thee before them .
free among the dead , like the slain that lie in the grave , whom thou rememberest no more : and they are cut off from thy hand .
thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me ; thou hast made me an abomination unto them : I am shut up , and I CANNOT come forth .
shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave ? or thy faithfulness in destruction ?
but unto thee have I cried , O LORD ; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee .
lover and friend hast thou put far from me , and mine acquaintance into darkness .
and the heavens shall praise thy wonders , O LORD : thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints .
thou hast broken Rahab in pieces , as one that is slain ; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm .
justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne : mercy and truth shall go before thy face .
blessed is the people that know the joyful sound : they shall walk , O LORD , in the light of thy countenance .
if his children forsake my law , and walk not in my judgments ;
if they break my statutes , and keep not my commandments ;
nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him , nor suffer my faithfulness to fail .
but thou hast cast off and abhorred , thou hast been wroth with thine anointed .
all that pass by the way spoil him : he is a reproach to his neighbours .
what man is he that liveth , and shall not see death ? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave ? Selah .
because thou hast made the LORD , which is my refuge , even the most High , thy habitation ;
for he shall give his angels charge over thee , to keep thee in all thy ways .
ye that love the LORD , hate evil : he preserveth the souls of his saints ; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked .
he that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house : he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight .
hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble ; incline thine ear unto me : in the day when I call answer me speedily .
because of thine indignation and thy wrath : for thou hast lifted me up , and cast me down .
so the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD , and all the kings of the earth thy glory .
when the LORD shall build up Zion , he shall appear in his glory .
the children of thy servants shall continue , and their seed shall be established before thee .
he made known his ways unto Moses , his acts unto the children of Israel .
man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening .
that thou givest them they gather : thou openest thine hand , they are filled with good .
saying , Touch not mine anointed , and do my prophets no harm .
and he brought forth his people with joy , and his chosen with gladness :
thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass .
but murmured in their tents , and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD .
thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions : and the plague brake in upon them .
yea , they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils ,
and shed innocent blood , even the blood of their sons and of their daughters , whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan : and the land was polluted with blood .
many times did he deliver them ; but they provoked him with their counsel , and were brought low for their iniquity .
and he remembered for them his covenant , and repented according to the multitude of his mercies .
fools because of their transgression , and because of their iniquities , are afflicted .
let his children be continually vagabonds , and beg : let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places .
let mine adversaries be clothed with shame , and let them cover themselves with their own confusion , as with a mantle .
the LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion : rule thou in the midst of thine enemies .
the Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath .
a good man sheweth favour , and lendeth : he will guide his affairs with discretion .
his heart is established , he shall not be afraid , until he see his desire upon his enemies .
not unto us , O LORD , not unto us , but unto thy name give glory , for thy mercy , and for thy truth 's sake .
O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes !
then shall I not be ashamed , when I have respect unto all thy commandments .
I will praise thee with uprightness of heart , when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments .
I will keep thy statutes : O forsake me not utterly .
wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way ? by taking heed thereto according to thy word .
with my whole heart have I sought thee : O let me not wander from thy commandments .
blessed art thou , O LORD : teach me thy statutes .
thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed , which do err from thy commandments .
my soul melteth for heaviness : strengthen thou me according unto thy word .
I have chosen the way of truth : thy judgments have I laid before me .
I will run the way of thy commandments , when thou shalt enlarge my heart .
Stablish thy word unto thy servant , who is devoted to thy fear .
and take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth ; for I have hoped in thy judgments .
I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings , and will not be ashamed .
my hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments , which I have loved ; and I will meditate in thy statutes .
I remembered thy judgments of old , O LORD ; and have comforted myself .
thou art my portion , O LORD : I have said that I would keep thy words .
at midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments .
thou hast dealt well with thy servant , O LORD , according unto thy word .
teach me good judgment and knowledge : for I have believed thy commandments .
thou art good , and doest good ; teach me thy statutes .
it is good for me that I have been afflicted ; that I might learn thy statutes .
let the proud be ashamed ; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause : but I will meditate in thy precepts .
they continue this day according to thine ordinances : for all are thy servants .
thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies : for they are ever with me .
I have not departed from thy judgments : for thou hast taught me .
how sweet are thy words unto my taste ! yea , sweeter than honey to my mouth !
I am afflicted very much : quicken me , O LORD , according unto thy word .
my soul is continually in my hand : yet do I not forget thy law .
the wicked have laid a snare for me : yet I erred not from thy precepts .
my flesh trembleth for fear of thee ; and I am afraid of thy judgments .
I have done judgment and justice : leave me not to mine oppressors .
mine eyes fail for thy salvation , and for the word of thy righteousness .
therefore I love thy commandments above gold ; yea , above fine gold .
my zeal hath consumed me , because mine enemies have forgotten thy words .
I am small and despised : yet do not I forget thy precepts .
trouble and anguish have taken hold on me : yet thy commandments are my delights .
I cried with my whole heart ; hear me , O LORD : I will keep thy statutes .
salvation is far from the wicked : for they seek not thy statutes .
I have longed for thy salvation , O LORD ; and thy law is my delight .
I have gone astray like a lost sheep ; seek thy servant ; for I do not forget thy commandments .
he will not suffer thy foot to be moved : he that keepeth thee will not slumber .
peace be within thy walls , and prosperity within thy palaces .
for the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous ; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity .
do good , O LORD , unto those that be good , and to them that are upright in their hearts .
happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them : they shall not be ashamed , but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate .
for thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands : happy shalt thou be , and it shall be well with thee .
thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house : thy children like olive plants round about thy table .
the LORD shall bless thee out of Zion : and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life .
yea , thou shalt see thy children 's children , and peace upon Israel .
many a time have they afflicted me from my youth , may Israel now say :
many a time have they afflicted me from my youth : yet they have not prevailed against me .
wherewith the mower filleth not his hand ; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom .
Lord , hear my voice : let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications .
I will not give sleep to mine eyes , or slumber to mine eyelids ,
arise , O LORD , into thy rest ; thou , and the ark of thy strength .
the LORD will perfect that which concerneth me : thy mercy , O LORD , endureth for ever : forsake not the works of thine own hands .
thou compassest my path and my lying down , and art acquainted with all my ways .
for there is not a word in my tongue , but , lo , O LORD , thou knowest it altogether .
whither shall I go from thy spirit ? or whither shall I flee from thy presence ?
yea , the darkness hideth not from thee ; but the night shineth as the day : the darkness and the light are both alike to thee .
my substance was not hid from thee , when I was made in secret , and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth .
how precious also are thy thoughts unto me , O God ! how great is the sum of them !
for they speak against thee wickedly , and thine enemies take thy name in vain .
do not I hate them , O LORD , that hate thee ? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee ?
they have sharpened their tongues like a serpent ; Adders ' poison is under their lips . Selah .
O GOD the Lord , the strength of my salvation , thou hast covered my head in the day of battle .
let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense ; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice .
incline not my heart to any evil thing , to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity : and let me not eat of their dainties .
attend unto my cry ; for I am brought very low : deliver me from my persecutors ; for they are stronger than I.
hear my prayer , O LORD , give ear to my supplications : in thy faithfulness answer me , and in thy righteousness .
I remember the days of old ; I meditate on all thy works ; I muse on the work of thy hands .
hear me speedily , O LORD : my spirit faileth : hide not thy face from me , lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit .
cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning ; for in thee do I trust : cause me to know the way wherein I should walk ; for I lift up my soul unto thee .
teach me to do thy will ; for thou art my God : thy spirit is good ; lead me into the land of uprightness .
quicken me , O LORD , for thy name 's sake : for thy righteousness ' sake bring my soul out of trouble .
one generation shall praise thy works to another , and shall declare thy mighty acts .
they shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness , and shall sing of thy righteousness .
the eyes of all wait upon thee ; and thou givest them their meat in due season .
for he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates ; he hath blessed thy children within thee .
let Israel rejoice in him that made him : let the children of Zion be joyful in their King .
let the saints be joyful in glory : let them sing aloud upon their beds .
for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head , and chains about thy neck .
but ye have set at nought all my counsel , and would none of my reproof :
he keepeth the paths of judgment , and preserveth the way of his saints .
whose ways are crooked , and they froward in their paths :
my son , forget not my law ; but let thine heart keep my commandments :
trust in the LORD with all thine heart ; and lean not unto thine own understanding .
it shall be health to thy navel , and marrow to thy bones .
honour the LORD with thy substance , and with the firstfruits of all thine increase :
so shall they be life unto thy soul , and grace to thy neck .
say not unto thy neighbour , Go , and come again , and to morrow I will give ; when thou hast it by thee .
for I was my father 's son , tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother .
put away from thee a froward mouth , and perverse lips put far from thee .
lest strangers be filled with thy wealth ; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger ;
and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers , nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me !
give not sleep to thine eyes , nor slumber to thine eyelids .
my son , keep thy father 's commandment , and forsake not the law of thy mother :
can one go upon hot coals , and his feet not be burned ?
men do not despise a thief , if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry ;
but whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding : he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul .
my son , keep my words , and lay up my commandments with thee .
say unto wisdom , Thou art my sister ; and call understanding thy kinswoman :
that they may keep thee from the strange woman , from the stranger which flattereth with her words .
he hath taken a bag of money with him , and will come home at the day appointed .
my fruit is better than gold , yea , than fine gold ; and my revenue than choice silver .
the LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way , before his works of old .
blessed is the man that heareth me , watching daily at my gates , waiting at the posts of my doors .
for by me thy days shall be multiplied , and the years of thy life shall be increased .
if thou be wise , thou shalt be wise for thyself : but if thou scornest , thou alone shalt bear it .
he that withholdeth corn , the people shall curse him : but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it .
he that is despised , and hath a servant , is better than he that honoureth himself , and lacketh bread .
he that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread : but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding .
he that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life : but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction .
whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed : but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded .
he that spareth his rod hateth his son : but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes .
the backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways : and a good man shall be satisfied from himself .
the poor is hated even of his own neighbour : but the rich hath many friends .
he that despiseth his neighbour sinneth : but he that hath mercy on the poor , happy is he .
a fool despiseth his father 's instruction : but he that regardeth reproof is prudent .
a wise son maketh a glad father : but a foolish man despiseth his mother .
the LORD hath made all things for himself : yea , even the wicked for the day of evil .
the highway of the upright is to depart from evil : he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul .
he that laboureth laboureth for himself ; for his mouth craveth it of him .
a violent man enticeth his neighbour , and leadeth him into the way that is not good .
he loveth transgression that loveth strife : and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction .
he that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow : and the father of a fool hath no joy .
a foolish son is a grief to his father , and bitterness to her that bare him .
he that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul : he that keepeth understanding shall find good .
he that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul ; but he that despiseth his ways shall die .
a king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes .
whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor , he also shall cry himself , but shall not be heard .
whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles .
thorns and snares are in the way of the froward : he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them .
if thou hast nothing to pay , why should he take away thy bed from under thee ?
remove not the ancient landmark , which thy fathers have set .
a wise man is strong ; yea , a man of knowledge increaseth strength .
for by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war : and in multitude of counsellers there is safety .
wisdom is too high for a fool : he openeth not his mouth in the gate .
debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself ; and discover not a secret to another :
as he that taketh away a garment in cold weather , and as vinegar upon nitre , so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart .
he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down , and without walls .
as a dog returneth to his vomit , so a fool returneth to his folly .
the slothful hideth his hand in his bosom ; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth .
so is the man that deceiveth his neighbour , and saith , Am not I in sport ?
let another man praise thee , and not thine own mouth ; a stranger , and not thine own lips .
ointment and perfume rejoice the heart : so doth the sweetness of a man 's friend by hearty counsel .
whosoever hideth her hideth the wind , and the ointment of his right hand , which bewrayeth itself .
better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness , than he that is perverse in his ways , though he be rich .
he that turneth away his ear from hearing the law , even his prayer shall be abomination .
he that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread : but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough .
whoso robbeth his father or his mother , and saith , It is no transgression ; the same is the companion of a destroyer .
he that giveth unto the poor shall not lack : but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse .
he , that being often reproved hardeneth his neck , shall suddenly be destroyed , and that without remedy .
a man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet .
whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul : he heareth cursing , and bewrayeth it not .
two things have I required of thee ; deny me them not before I die :
there is a generation that are pure in their own eyes , and yet is not washed from their filthiness .
for an odious woman when she is married ; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress .
the ants are a people not strong , yet they prepare their meat in the summer ;
give not thy strength unto women , nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings .
let him drink , and forget his poverty , and remember his misery no more .
she girdeth her loins with strength , and strengtheneth her arms .
she layeth her hands to the spindle , and her hands hold the distaff .
I communed with mine own heart , saying , Lo , I am come to great estate , and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem : yea , my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge .
and whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them , I withheld not my heart from any joy ; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour : and this was my portion of all my labour .
for what hath man of all his labour , and of the vexation of his heart , wherein he hath laboured under the sun ?
there is nothing better for a man , than that he should eat and drink , and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour . this also I saw , that it was from the hand of God .
I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men , that God might manifest them , and that they might see that they themselves are beasts .
the fool foldeth his hands together , and eateth his own flesh .
be not rash with thy mouth , and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God : for God is in heaven , and thou upon earth : therefore let thy words be few .
be not righteous over much ; neither make thyself over wise : why shouldest thou destroy thyself ?
go thy way , eat thy bread with joy , and drink thy wine with a merry heart ; for God now accepteth thy works .

thy lips are like a thread of scarlet , and thy speech is comely : thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks .

fear thou not , O Jacob my servant , saith the LORD : for I am with thee ; for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee : but I will not make a full end of thee , but correct thee in measure ; yet will I not leave thee wholly unpunished .
at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses , at the rushing of his chariots , and at the rumbling of his wheels , the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands ;
Moab hath been at ease from his youth , and he hath settled on his lees , and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel , neither hath he gone into captivity : therefore his taste remained in him , and his scent is not changed .
O vine of Sibmah , I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer : thy plants are gone over the sea , they reach even to the sea of Jazer : the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage .
for thus saith the LORD ; Behold , he shall fly as an eagle , and shall spread his wings over Moab .
Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys , thy flowing valley , O backsliding daughter ? that trusted in her treasures , saying , Who shall come unto me ?
leave thy fatherless children , I will preserve them alive ; and let thy widows trust in me .
my people hath been lost sheep : their shepherds have caused them to go astray , they have turned them away on the mountains : they have gone from mountain to hill , they have forgotten their restingplace .
all that found them have devoured them : and their adversaries said , We offend not , because they have sinned against the LORD , the habitation of justice , even the LORD , the hope of their fathers .
cut off the sower from Babylon , and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest : for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people , and they shall flee every one to his own land .
I have laid a snare for thee , and thou art also taken , O Babylon , and thou wast not aware : thou art found , and also caught , because thou hast striven against the LORD .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and deliver every man his soul : be not cut off in her iniquity ; for this is the time of the LORD 's vengeance ; he will render unto her a recompence .
the LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself , saying , Surely I will fill thee with men , as with caterpillers ; and they shall lift up a shout against thee .
every man is brutish by his knowledge ; every founder is confounded by the graven image : for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
behold , I am against thee , O destroying mountain , saith the LORD , which destroyest all the earth : and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee , and roll thee down from the rocks , and will make thee a burnt mountain .
the mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight , they have remained in their holds : their might hath failed ; they became as women : they have burned her dwellingplaces ; her bars are broken .
therefore thus saith the LORD ; Behold , I will plead thy cause , and take vengeance for thee ; and I will dry up her sea , and make her springs dry .
though Babylon should mount up to heaven , and though she should fortify the height of her strength , yet from me shall spoilers come unto her , saith the LORD .
and changed his prison garments : and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life .
all her people sigh , they seek bread ; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul : see , O LORD , and consider ; for I am become vile .
Zion spreadeth forth her hands , and there is none to comfort her : the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob , that his adversaries should be round about him : Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them .
I called for my lovers , but they deceived me : my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city , while they sought their meat to relieve their souls .
they say to their mothers , Where is corn and wine ? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city , when their soul was poured out into their mothers ' bosom .
all thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee : they hiss and gnash the teeth : they say , We have swallowed her up : certainly this is the day that we looked for ; we have found , we have seen it .
their heart cried unto the Lord , O wall of the daughter of Zion , let tears run down like a river day and night : give thyself no rest ; let not the apple of thine eye cease .
he hath hedged me about , that I CANNOT get out : he hath made my chain heavy .
it is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth .
to crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth ,
Wherefore doth a living man complain , a man for the punishment of his sins ?
all our enemies have opened their mouths against us .
waters flowed over mine head ; then I said , I am cut off .
thou hast heard my voice : hide not thine ear at my breathing , at my cry .
O Lord , thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul ; thou hast redeemed my life .
the hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children : they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
the punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished , O daughter of Zion ; he will no more carry thee away into captivity : he will visit thine iniquity , O daughter of Edom ; he will discover thy sins .
we Gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness .
turn thou us unto thee , O LORD , and we shall be turned ; renew our days as of old .
and they went every one straight forward : whither the spirit was to go , they went ; and they turned not when they went .
and thou , son of man , be not afraid of them , neither be afraid of their words , though briers and thorns be with thee , and thou dost dwell among scorpions : be not afraid of their words , nor be dismayed at their looks , though they be a rebellious house .
not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language , whose words thou canst not understand . surely , had I sent thee to them , they would have hearkened unto thee .
then the spirit took me up , and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing , saying , Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place .
yet if thou warn the wicked , and he turn not from his wickedness , nor from his wicked way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but thou hast delivered thy soul .
nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man , that the righteous sin not , and he doth not sin , he shall surely live , because he is warned ; also thou hast delivered thy soul .
then I arose , and went forth into the plain : and , behold , the glory of the LORD stood there , as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar : and I fell on my face .
then the spirit entered into me , and set me upon my feet , and spake with me , and said unto me , Go , shut thyself within thine house .
but thou , O son of man , behold , they shall put bands upon thee , and shall bind thee with them , and thou shalt not go out among them :
thou also , son of man , take thee a tile , and lay it before thee , and pourtray upon it the city , even Jerusalem :
and when thou hast accomplished them , lie again on thy right side , and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days : I have appointed thee each day for a year .
and , behold , I will lay bands upon thee , and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another , till thou hast ended the days of thy siege .
and the LORD said , Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles , whither I will drive them .
that they may want bread and water , and be astonied one with another , and consume away for their iniquity .
and thou , son of man , take thee a sharp knife , take thee a barber 's rasor , and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard : then take thee balances to weight , and divide the hair .
thou shalt also take thereof a few in number , and bind them in thy skirts .
and she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations , and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her : for they have refused my judgments and my statutes , they have not walked in them .
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I , even I , am against thee , and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations .
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments in thee , and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds .
thus shall mine anger be accomplished , and I will cause my fury to rest upon them , and I will be comforted : and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal , when I have accomplished my fury in them .
now is the end come upon thee , and I will send mine anger upon thee , and will judge thee according to thy ways , and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations .
now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee , and accomplish mine anger upon thee : and I will judge thee according to thy ways , and will recompense thee for all thine abominations .
therefore will I also deal in fury : mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice , yet will I not hear them .
he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice , saying , Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near , even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand .
and it came to pass , while they were slaying them , and I was left , that I fell upon my face , and cried , and said , Ah Lord GOD ! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem ?
and one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims , and took thereof , and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen : who took it , and went out .
and when the cherubims went , the wheels went by them : and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth , the same wheels also turned not from beside them .
dig thou through the wall in their sight , and carry out thereby .
because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the wicked , that he should not return from his wicked way , by promising him life :
then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me , and sat before me .
son of man , these men have set up their idols in their heart , and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face : should I be inquired of at all by them ?
that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart , because they are all estranged from me through their idols .
for thus saith the Lord GOD ; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem , the sword , and the famine , and the noisome beast , and the pestilence , to cut off from it man and beast ?
none eye pitied thee , to do any of these unto thee , to have compassion upon thee ; but thou wast cast out in the open field , to the lothing of thy person , in the day that thou wast born .
and I put a jewel on thy forehead , and earrings in thine ears , and a beautiful crown upon thine head .
and thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty : for it was perfect through my comeliness , which I had put upon thee , saith the Lord GOD .
moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters , whom thou hast borne unto me , and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured . is this of thy whoredoms a small matter ,
and in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth , when thou wast naked and bare , and wast polluted in thy blood .
and it came to pass after all thy wickedness , ( woe , woe unto thee ! saith the Lord GOD ; )
in that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way , and makest thine high place in every street ; and hast not been as an harlot , in that thou scornest hire ;
they give gifts to all whores : but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers , and hirest them , that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom .
so will I make my fury toward thee to rest , and my jealousy shall depart from thee , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
thou art thy mother 's daughter , that lotheth her husband and her children ; and thou art the sister of thy sisters , which lothed their husbands and their children : your mother was an Hittite , and your father an Amorite .
and thine elder sister is Samaria , she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand : and thy younger sister , that dwelleth at thy right hand , is Sodom and her daughters .
yet hast thou not walked after their ways , nor done after their abominations : but , as if that were a very little thing , thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways .
behold , this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom , pride , fulness of bread , and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters , neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy .
neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins ; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they , and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done .
for thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride ,
nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth , and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant .
then thou shalt remember thy ways , and be ashamed , when thou shalt receive thy sisters , thine elder and thy younger : and I will give them unto thee for daughters , but not by thy covenant .
there was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers : and , behold , this vine did bend her roots toward him , and shot forth her branches toward him , that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation .
say now to the rebellious house , Know ye not what these things mean ? tell them , Behold , the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem , and hath taken the king thereof , and the princes thereof , and led them with him to Babylon ;
and hath taken of the king 's seed , and made a covenant with him , and hath taken an oath of him : he hath also taken the mighty of the land :
but he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt , that they might give him horses and much people . shall he prosper ? shall he escape that doeth such things ? or shall he break the covenant , and be delivered ?
seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant , when , lo , he had given his hand , and hath done all these things , he shall not escape .
and hath not eaten upon the mountains , neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , neither hath defiled his neighbour 's wife , neither hath come near to a menstruous woman ,
he that hath not given forth upon usury , neither hath taken any increase , that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity , hath executed true judgment between man and man ,
that hath taken off his hand from the poor , that hath not received usury nor increase , hath executed my judgments , hath walked in my statutes ; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father , he shall surely live .
but if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die ? saith the Lord GOD : and not that he should return from his ways , and live ?
again , when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed , and doeth that which is lawful and right , he shall save his soul alive .
because he considereth , and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
yet saith the house of Israel , The way of the Lord is not equal . O house of Israel , are not my ways equal ? are not your ways unequal ?
cast away from you all your transgressions , whereby ye have transgressed ; and make you a new heart and a new spirit : for why will ye die , O house of Israel ?
now when she saw that she had waited , and her hope was lost , then she took another of her whelps , and made him a young lion .
and she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule , and her stature was exalted among the thick branches , and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches .
because they had not executed my judgments , but had despised my statutes , and had polluted my sabbaths , and their eyes were after their fathers ' idols .
Wherefore say unto the house of Israel , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers ? and commit ye whoredom after their abominations ?
thus saith the Lord GOD ; Remove the diadem , and take off the crown : this shall not be the same : exalt him that is low , and abase him that is high .
and I will pour out mine indignation upon thee , I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath , and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men , and skilful to destroy .
then say thou , Thus saith the Lord GOD , The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it , that her time may come , and maketh idols against herself to defile herself .
behold , the princes of Israel , every one were in thee to their power to shed blood .
in thee have they discovered their fathers ' nakedness : in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution .
behold , therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made , and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee .
and I will scatter thee among the heathen , and disperse thee in the countries , and will consume thy filthiness out of thee .
and Aholah played the harlot when she was mine ; and she doted on her lovers , on the Assyrians her neighbours ,
and that she increased her whoredoms : for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall , the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion ,
and as soon as she saw them with her eyes , she doted upon them , and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea .
so she discovered her whoredoms , and discovered her nakedness : then my mind was alienated from her , like as my mind was alienated from her sister .
there , O Aholibah , thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I will raise up thy lovers against thee , from whom thy mind is alienated , and I will bring them against thee on every side ;
thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee , and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt : so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them , nor remember Egypt any more .
and they shall deal with thee hatefully , and shall take away all thy labour , and shall leave thee naked and bare : and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered , both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms .
thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow , with the cup of astonishment and desolation , with the cup of thy sister Samaria .
for when they had slain their children to their idols , then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it ; and , lo , thus have they done in the midst of mine house .
son of man , write thee the name of the day , even of this same day : the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day .
in thy filthiness is lewdness : because I have purged thee , and thou wast not purged , thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more , till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee .
son of man , behold , I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke : yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep , neither shall thy tears run down .
behold , therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession , and they shall set their palaces in thee , and make their dwellings in thee : they shall eat thy fruit , and they shall drink thy milk .
behold , therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee , and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen ; and I will cut thee off from the people , and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries : I will destroy thee ; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD .
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I am against thee , O Tyrus , and will cause many nations to come up against thee , as the sea causeth his waves to come up .
he shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field : and he shall make a fort against thee , and cast a mount against thee , and lift up the Buckler against thee .
thus saith the Lord GOD to Tyrus ; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall , when the wounded cry , when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee ?
for thus saith the Lord GOD ; When I shall make thee a desolate city , like the cities that are not inhabited ; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee , and great waters shall cover thee ;
fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail ; blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was that which covered thee .
the inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy mariners : thy wise men , O Tyrus , that were in thee , were thy pilots .
the ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy calkers : all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise .
they of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army , thy men of war : they hanged the shield and helmet in thee ; they set forth thy comeliness .
the men of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about , and the Gammadims were in thy towers : they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about ; they have made thy beauty perfect .
by thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased thy riches , and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches :
behold , therefore I will bring strangers upon thee , the terrible of the nations : and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom , and they shall defile thy brightness .
thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created , till iniquity was found in thee .
by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence , and thou hast sinned : therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God : and I will destroy thee , O covering cherub , from the midst of the stones of fire .
he and his people with him , the terrible of the nations , shall be brought to destroy the land : and they shall draw their swords against Egypt , and fill the land with the slain .
thus was he fair in his greatness , in the length of his branches : for his root was by great waters .
thus saith the Lord GOD ; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people ; and they shall bring thee up in my net .
all the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee , and set darkness upon thy land , saith the Lord GOD .
yea , I will make many people amazed at thee , and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee , when I shall brandish my sword before them ; and they shall tremble at every moment , every man for his own life , in the day of thy fall .
Pharaoh shall see them , and shall be comforted over all his multitude , even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword , saith the Lord GOD .
nevertheless , if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it ; if he do not turn from his way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but thou hast delivered thy soul .
say unto them , As I live , saith the Lord GOD , I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked ; but that the wicked turn from his way and live : turn ye , turn ye from your evil ways ; for why will ye die , O house of Israel ?
again , when I say unto the wicked , Thou shalt surely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is lawful and right ;
when the righteous turneth from his righteousness , and committeth iniquity , he shall even die thereby .
but if the wicked turn from his wickedness , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall live thereby .
as a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered ; so will I seek out my sheep , and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day .
and ye my flock , the flock of my pasture , are men , and I am your God , saith the Lord GOD .
and say unto it , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , O mount Seir , I am against thee , and I will stretch out mine hand against thee , and I will make thee most desolate .
I will make thee perpetual desolations , and thy cities shall not return : and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
and thou shalt know that I am the LORD , and that I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel , saying , They are laid desolate , they are given us to consume .
therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; I have lifted up mine hand , Surely the heathen that are about you , they shall bear their shame .
neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more , neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more , neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more , saith the Lord GOD .
son of man , when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land , they defiled it by their own way and by their doings : their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman .
then shall ye remember your own evil ways , and your doings that were not good , and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations .
and I will lay sinews upon you , and will bring up flesh upon you , and cover you with skin , and put breath in you , and ye shall live ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
and join them one to another into one stick ; and they shall become one in thine hand .
and I will turn thee back , and put hooks into thy jaws , and I will bring thee forth , and all thine army , horses and horsemen , all of them clothed with all sorts of armour , even a great company with bucklers and shields , all of them handling swords :
for in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken , Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel ;
and I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand , and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand .
after that they have borne their shame , and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me , when they dwelt safely in their land , and none made them afraid .
thou son of man , shew the house to the house of Israel , that they may be ashamed of their iniquities : and let them measure the pattern .
and the altar shall be twelve cubits long , twelve broad , square in the four squares thereof .
and ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things : but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves .
because they ministered unto them before their idols , and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity ; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them , saith the Lord GOD , and they shall bear their iniquity .
and they shall not come near unto me , to do the office of a priest unto me , nor to come near to any of my holy things , in the most holy place : but they shall bear their shame , and their abominations which they have committed .
they shall enter into my sanctuary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister unto me , and they shall keep my charge .
the ephah and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain the tenth part of an Homer , and the ephah the tenth part of an Homer : the measure thereof shall be after the Homer .
and upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering .
but Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king 's meat , nor with the wine which he drank : therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself .
then Daniel went to his house , and made the thing known to Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah , his companions :
then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face , and worshipped Daniel , and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him .
Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them , Is it true , O Shadrach , Meshach , and Abed @-@ nego , do not ye serve my gods , nor worship the golden image which I have set up ?
then these men were bound in their coats , their hosen , and their hats , and their other garments , and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied , and rose up in haste , and spake , and said unto his counsellers , Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire ? they answered and said unto the king , True , O king .
I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me .
I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house , and flourishing in my palace :
thus were the visions of mine head in my bed ; I saw , and behold a tree in the midst of the earth , and the height thereof was great .
I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed , and , behold , a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven ;
Wherefore , O king , let my counsel be acceptable unto thee , and break off thy sins by righteousness , and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor ; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity .
then the king 's countenance was changed , and his thoughts troubled him , so that the joints of his loins were loosed , and his knees smote one against another .
then Daniel answered and said before the king , Let thy gifts be to thyself , and give thy rewards to another ; yet I will read the writing unto the king , and make known to him the interpretation .
O thou king , the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom , and majesty , and glory , and honour :
but when his heart was lifted up , and his mind hardened in pride , he was deposed from his kingly throne , and they took his glory from him :
then these men assembled , and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God .
and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den ; and the king sealed it with his own signet , and with the signet of his lords ; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel .
then was the king exceeding glad for him , and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . so Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no manner of hurt was found upon him , because he believed in his God .
in the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed : then he wrote the dream , and told the sum of the matters .
I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body , and the visions of my head troubled me .
and I prayed unto the LORD my God , and made my confession , and said , O Lord , the great and dreadful God , keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him , and to them that keep his commandments ;
neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets , which spake in thy name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God , to walk in his laws , which he set before us by his servants the prophets .
and he hath confirmed his words , which he spake against us , and against our judges that judged us , by bringing upon us a great evil : for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem .
and now , O Lord our God , that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and hast gotten thee renown , as at this day ; we have sinned , we have done wickedly .
now therefore , O our God , hear the prayer of thy servant , and his supplications , and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate , for the Lord 's sake .
O Lord , hear ; O Lord , forgive ; O Lord , hearken and do ; defer not , for thine own sake , O my God : for thy city and thy people are called by thy name .
and , behold , an hand touched me , which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands .
now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days : for yet the vision is for many days .
then shall he return into his land with great riches ; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant ; and he shall do exploits , and return to his own land .
he shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries : and the land of Egypt shall not escape .
and he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain ; yet he shall come to his end , and none shall help him .
plead with your mother , plead : for she is not my wife , neither am I her husband : let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight , and her adulteries from between her breasts ;
therefore , behold , I will hedge up thy way with thorns , and make a wall , that she shall not find her paths .
and I will give her her vineyards from thence , and the valley of Achor for a door of hope : and she shall sing there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness : and thou shalt know the LORD .
and I will sow her unto me in the earth ; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy ; and I will say to them which were not my people , Thou art my people ; and they shall say , Thou art my God .
and I said unto her , Thou shalt abide for me many days ; thou shalt not play the harlot , and thou shalt not be for another man : so will I also be for thee .
my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge : because thou hast rejected knowledge , I will also reject thee , that thou shalt be no priest to me : seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God , I will also forget thy children .
my people ask counsel at their stocks , and their staff declareth unto them : for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err , and they have gone a whoring from under their God .
and the pride of Israel doth testify to his face : therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity ; Judah also shall fall with them .
when Ephraim saw his sickness , and Judah saw his wound , then went Ephraim to the Assyrian , and sent to king Jareb : yet could he not heal you , nor cure you of your wound .
and they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness : now their own doings have beset them about ; they are before my face .
they make the king glad with their wickedness , and the princes with their lies .
in the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine ; he stretched out his hand with scorners .
for they have made ready their heart like an oven , whiles they lie in wait : their baker sleepeth all the night ; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire .

but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth , and cry mightily unto God : yea , let them turn every one from his evil way , and from the violence that is in their hands .
and God saw their works , that they turned from their evil way ; and God repented of the evil , that he had said that he would do unto them ; and he did it not .

O thou that art named the house of Jacob , is the spirit of the LORD straitened ? are these his doings ? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly ?
the women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses ; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever .

and am no more worthy to be called thy son : make me as one of thy hired servants .
and the son said unto him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and in thy sight , and am no more worthy to be called thy son .
but as soon as this thy son was come , which hath devoured thy living with harlots , thou hast killed for him the fatted calf .
and he said also unto his disciples , There was a certain rich man , which had a steward ; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods .
then the steward said within himself , What shall I do ? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship : I CANNOT dig ; to beg I am ashamed .
I am resolved what to do , that , when I am put out of the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses .
so he called every one of his lord 's debtors unto him , and said unto the first , How much owest thou unto my lord ?
and he cried and said , Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue ; for I am tormented in this flame .
take heed to yourselves : if thy brother trespass against thee , rebuke him ; and if he repent , forgive him .
and he would not for a while : but afterward he said within himself , Though I fear not God , nor regard man ;
and shall not God avenge his own elect , which cry day and night unto him , though he bear long with them ?
and he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and despised others :
the Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself , God , I thank thee , that I am not as other men are , extortioners , unjust , adulterers , or even as this publican .
I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other : for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .
and he called his ten servants , and delivered them ten pounds , and said unto them , Occupy till I come .
but those mine enemies , which would not that I should reign over them , bring hither , and slay them before me .
and some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him , Master , rebuke thy disciples .
saying , If thou hadst known , even thou , at least in this thy day , the things which belong unto thy peace ! but now they are hid from thine eyes .
and shall lay thee even with the ground , and thy children within thee ; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another ; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation .
but when the Husbandmen saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , This is the heir : come , let us kill him , that the inheritance may be ours .
then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples ,
and he looked up , and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury .
and take heed to yourselves , lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting , and drunkenness , and cares of this life , and so that day come upon you unawares .
and he took the cup , and gave thanks , and said , Take this , and divide it among yourselves :
but I have prayed for thee , that thy faith fail not : and when thou art converted , strengthen thy brethren .
then said he unto them , But now , he that hath a purse , let him take it , and likewise his scrip : and he that hath no sword , let him sell his garment , and buy one .
and the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together : for before they were at enmity between themselves .
but Jesus turning unto them said , Daughters of Jerusalem , weep not for me , but weep for yourselves , and for your children .
and as they were afraid , and bowed down their faces to the earth , they said unto them , Why seek ye the living among the dead ?
and they talked together of all these things which had happened .
and it came to pass , that , while they communed together and reasoned , Jesus himself drew near , and went with them .
and he said unto them , What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another , as ye walk , and are sad ?
then said they unto him , Who art thou ? that we may give an answer to them that sent us . what sayest thou of thyself ?
the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him , and saith , Behold the Lamb of God , which taketh away the sin of the world .
and John bare record , saying , I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove , and it abode upon him .
for God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world ; but that the world through him might be saved .
John answered and said , A man can receive nothing , except it be given him from heaven .
the woman then left her waterpot , and went her way into the city , and saith to the men ,
therefore said the disciples one to another , Hath any man brought him ought to eat ?
for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool , and troubled the water : whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had .
and immediately the man was made whole , and took up his bed , and walked : and on the same day was the sabbath .
then answered Jesus and said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , The Son can do nothing of himself , but what he seeth the Father do : for what things soever he doeth , these also doeth the Son likewise .
I can of mine own self do nothing : as I hear , I judge : and my judgment is just ; because I seek not mine own will , but the will of the Father which hath sent me .
but I know you , that ye have not the love of God in you .
Jesus therefore answered and said unto them , Murmur not among yourselves .
the Jews therefore strove among themselves , saying , How can this man give us his flesh to eat ?
then Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man , and drink his blood , ye have no life in you .
when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it , he said unto them , doth this offend you ?
if any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of God , or whether I speak of myself .
then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught , saying , Ye both know me , and ye know whence I am : and I am not come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye know not .
then said Jesus unto them , When ye have lifted up the Son of man , then shall ye know that I am he , and that I do nothing of myself ; but as my Father hath taught me , I speak these things .
art thou greater than our father Abraham , which is dead ? and the prophets are dead : whom makest thou thyself ?
Jesus said unto them , If ye were blind , ye should have no sin : but now ye say , We see ; therefore your sin remaineth .
I am the good shepherd : the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep .
but he that is an hireling , and not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , seeth the wolf coming , and leaveth the sheep , and fleeth : and the wolf catcheth them , and scattereth the sheep .
and I give unto them eternal life ; and they shall never perish , neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand .
Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave . it was a cave , and a stone lay upon it .
this he said , not that he cared for the poor ; but because he was a thief , and had the bag , and bare what was put therein .
for the poor always ye have with you ; but me ye have not always .
the Pharisees therefore said among themselves , perceive ye how ye prevail nothing ? behold , the world is gone after him .
he that loveth his life shall lose it ; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal .
he that rejecteth me , and receiveth not my words , hath one that judgeth him : the word that I have spoken , the same shall judge him in the last day .
for I have not spoken of myself ; but the Father which sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
he riseth from supper , and laid aside his garments ; and took a towel , and girded himself .
by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples , if ye have love one to another .
and if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and receive you unto myself ; that where I am , there ye may be also .
Believest thou not that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself : but the Father that dwelleth in me , he doeth the works .
if ye keep my commandments , ye shall abide in my love ; even as I have kept my Father 's commandments , and abide in his love .
greater love hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends .
if ye were of the world , the world would love his own : but because ye are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world hateth you .
and now , O Father , glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was .
and now come I to thee ; and these things I speak in the world , that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves .
O righteous Father , the world hath not known thee : but I have known thee , and these have known that thou hast sent me .
Jesus answered him , sayest thou this thing of thyself , or did others tell it thee of me ?
when Jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he loved , he saith unto his mother , Woman , behold thy son !
then saith he to the disciple , Behold thy mother ! and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home .
Jesus saith unto her , Touch me not ; for I am not yet ascended to my Father : but go to my brethren , and say unto them , I ascend unto my Father , and your Father ; and to my God , and your God .
and they were all amazed and marvelled , saying one to another , Behold , are not all these which speak Galilaeans ?
but Peter , standing up with the eleven , lifted up his voice , and said unto them , Ye men of Judaea , and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem , be this known unto you , and hearken to my words :
and I will shew wonders in heaven above , and signs in the earth beneath ; blood , and fire , and vapour of smoke :
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves ,
and now , Lord , behold their threatenings : and grant unto thy servants , that with all boldness they may speak thy word ,
whiles it remained , was it not thine own ? and after it was sold , was it not in thine own power ? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart ? thou hast not lied unto men , but unto God .
and laid their hands on the apostles , and put them in the common prison .
and said unto them , Ye men of Israel , take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men .
after this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing , and drew away much people after him : he also perished ; and all , even as many as obeyed him , were dispersed .
and said unto him , Get thee out of thy country , and from thy kindred , and come into the land which I shall shew thee .
and delivered him out of all his afflictions , and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt ; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house .
and at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren ; and Joseph 's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh .
the same dealt subtilly with our kindred , and evil entreated our fathers , so that they cast out their young children , to the end they might not live .
and when he was cast out , Pharaoh 's daughter took him up , and nourished him for her own son .
and when he was full forty years old , it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel .
then they cried out with a loud voice , and stopped their ears , and ran upon him with one accord ,
repent therefore of this thy wickedness , and pray God , if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee .
was returning , and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet .
the place of the scripture which he read was this , He was led as a sheep to the slaughter ; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer , so opened he not his mouth :
and the eunuch answered Philip , and said , I pray thee , of whom speaketh the prophet this ? of himself , or of some other man ?
then Ananias answered , Lord , I have heard by many of this man , how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem :
and when he looked on him , he was afraid , and said , What is it , Lord ? and he said unto him , Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God .
now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean , behold , the men which were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon 's house , and stood before the gate ,
and the morrow after they entered into Caesarea . and Cornelius waited for them , and had called together his kinsmen and near friends .
how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power : who went about doing good , and healing all that were oppressed of the devil ; for God was with him .
and they said unto her , Thou art mad . but she constantly affirmed that it was even so . then said they , It is his angel .
and Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem , when they had fulfilled their ministry , and took with them John , whose surname was Mark .
and when they were at Salamis , they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews : and they had also John to their minister .
nevertheless he left not himself without witness , in that he did good , and gave us rain from heaven , and fruitful seasons , filling our hearts with food and gladness .
that ye abstain from meats offered to idols , and from blood , and from things strangled , and from fornication : from which if ye keep yourselves , ye shall do well . fare ye well .
but Paul cried with a loud voice , saying , Do thyself no harm : for we are all here .
and when he had brought them into his house , he set meat before them , and rejoiced , believing in God with all his house .
and when they opposed themselves , and blasphemed , he shook his raiment , and said unto them , Your blood be upon your own heads ; I am clean : from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles .
and Crispus , the chief ruler of the synagogue , believed on the Lord with all his house ; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed , and were baptized .
and now , behold , I know that ye all , among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God , shall see my face no more .
take heed therefore unto yourselves , and to all the flock , over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers , to feed the church of God , which he hath purchased with his own blood .
also of your own selves shall men arise , speaking perverse things , to draw away disciples after them .
and when he had thus spoken , he kneeled down , and prayed with them all .
there went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea , and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus , an old disciple , with whom we should lodge .
do therefore this that we say to thee : we have four men which have a vow on them ;
and I said , Lord , they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee :
then said Paul , I wist not , brethren , that he was the high priest : for it is written , Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people .
then Agrippa said unto Paul , Thou art permitted to speak for thyself . then Paul stretched forth the hand , and answered for himself :
my manner of life from my youth , which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem , know all the Jews ;
and when they were gone aside , they talked between themselves , saying , This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds .
and when they agreed not among themselves , they departed , after that Paul had spoken one word , Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers ,
making request , if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you .
and likewise also the men , leaving the natural use of the woman , burned in their lust one toward another ; men with men working that which is unseemly , and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet .
or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering ; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance ?
but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God ;
and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind , a light of them which are in darkness ,
but I see another law in my members , warring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members .
for what the law could not do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh , and for sin , condemned sin in the flesh :
and not only they , but ourselves also , which have the firstfruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for the adoption , to wit , the redemption of our body .
but what saith it ? the word is nigh thee , even in thy mouth , and in thy heart : that is , the word of faith , which we preach ;
for I would not , brethren , that ye should be ignorant of this mystery , lest ye should be wise in your own conceits ; that blindness in part is happened to Israel , until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in .
dearly beloved , avenge not yourselves , but rather give place unto wrath : for it is written , Vengeance is mine ; I will repay , saith the Lord .
whosoever therefore resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God : and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation .
so then every one of us shall give account of himself to God .
hast thou faith ? have it to thyself before God . happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth .
for even Christ pleased not himself ; but , as it is written , The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me .
now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that ye may abound in hope , through the power of the Holy Ghost .
let no man deceive himself . if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world , let him become a fool , that he may be wise .
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you , or of man 's judgment : yea , I judge not mine own self .
for I know nothing by myself ; yet am I not hereby justified : but he that judgeth me is the Lord .
I write not these things to shame you , but as my beloved sons I warn you .
now therefore there is utterly a fault among you , because ye go to law one with another . why do ye not rather take wrong ? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded ?
what ? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you , which ye have of God , and ye are not your own ?
but and if she depart , let her remain unmarried , or be reconciled to her husband : and let not the husband put away his wife .
for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily , eateth and drinketh damnation to himself , not discerning the Lord 's body .
for if we would judge ourselves , we should not be judged .
and if they will learn any thing , let them ask their husbands at home : for it is a shame for women to speak in the church .
upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store , as God hath prospered him , that there be no gatherings when I come .
but we had the sentence of death in ourselves , that we should not trust in ourselves , but in God which raiseth the dead :
but I determined this with myself , that I would not come again to you in heaviness .
not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves ; but our sufficiency is of God ;
and not as Moses , which put a Vail over his face , that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished :
for whether we be beside ourselves , it is to God : or whether we be sober , it is for your cause .
for we dare not make ourselves of the number , or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves : but they measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves among themselves , are not wise .
of such an one will I glory : yet of myself I will not glory , but in mine infirmities .
examine yourselves , whether ye be in the faith ; prove your own selves . know ye not your own selves , how that Jesus Christ is in you , except ye be reprobates ?
I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel :
for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews ' religion , how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God , and wasted it :
but when it pleased God , who separated me from my mother 's womb , and called me by his grace ,
then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas , and took Titus with me also .
and my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not , nor rejected ; but received me as an angel of God , even as Christ Jesus .
I have confidence in you through the Lord , that ye will be none otherwise minded : but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment , whosoever he be .
for all the law is fulfilled in one word , even in this ; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
brethren , if a man be overtaken in a fault , ye which are spiritual , restore such an one in the spirit of meekness ; considering thyself , lest thou also be tempted .
for if a man think himself to be something , when he is nothing , he deceiveth himself .
but let every man prove his own work , and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone , and not in another .
as we have therefore opportunity , let us do good unto all men , especially unto them who are of the household of faith .
in whom also we have obtained an inheritance , being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will :
cease not to give thanks for you , making mention of you in my prayers ;
but God , who is rich in mercy , for his great love wherewith he loved us ,
that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus .
this I say therefore , and testify in the Lord , that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk , in the vanity of their mind ,
Wherefore putting away lying , speak every man truth with his neighbour : for we are members one of another .
let all bitterness , and wrath , and anger , and clamour , and evil speaking , be put away from you , with all malice :
speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord ;
for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall be joined unto his wife , and they two shall be one flesh .
servants , be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in singleness of your heart , as unto Christ ;
let nothing be done through strife or vainglory ; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves .
look not every man on his own things , but every man also on the things of others .
for all seek their own , not the things which are Jesus Christ 's .
and I intreat thee also , true yokefellow , help those women which laboured with me in the gospel , with Clement also , and with other my fellowlabourers , whose names are in the book of life .
forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved , to fill up their sins alway : for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost .
he therefore that despiseth , despiseth not man , but God , who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit .
and that ye study to be quiet , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , as we commanded you ;
for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the archangel , and with the trump of God : and the dead in Christ shall rise first :
one that ruleth well his own house , having his children in subjection with all gravity ;
let the deacons be the husbands of one wife , ruling their children and their own houses well .
take heed unto thyself , and unto the doctrine ; continue in them : for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself , and them that hear thee .
let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour , that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed .
charge them that are rich in this world , that they be not highminded , nor trust in uncertain riches , but in the living God , who giveth us richly all things to enjoy ;
when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee , which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois , and thy mother Eunice ; and I am persuaded that in thee also .
remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel :
and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work , and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom : to whom be glory for ever and ever . Amen .
in all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works : in doctrine shewing uncorruptness , gravity , sincerity ,
I thank my God , making mention of thee always in my prayers ,
that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus .
I beseech thee for my son Onesimus , whom I have begotten in my bonds :
whom I would have retained with me , that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel :
and of the angels he saith , Who maketh his angels spirits , and his ministers a flame of fire .
but unto the Son he saith , Thy throne , O God , is for ever and ever : a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom .
thou hast loved righteousness , and hated iniquity ; therefore God , even thy God , hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows .
and , Thou , Lord , in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth ; and the heavens are the works of thine hands :
and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up , and they shall be changed : but thou art the same , and thy years shall not fail .
for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise , And God did rest the seventh day from all his works .
for he that is entered into his rest , he also hath ceased from his own works , as God did from his .
and no man taketh this honour unto himself , but he that is called of God , as was Aaron .
and here men that die receive tithes ; but there he receiveth them , of whom it is witnessed that he liveth .
and they shall not teach every man his neighbour , and every man his brother , saying , Know the Lord : for all shall know me , from the least to the greatest .
but into the second went the high priest alone once every year , not without blood , which he offered for himself , and for the errors of the people :
then said I , Lo , I come ( in the volume of the book it is written of me , ) to do thy will , O God .
then said he , Lo , I come to do thy will , O God . he taketh away the first , that he may establish the second .
but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition ; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul .
by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death ; and was not found , because God had translated him : for before his translation he had this testimony , that he pleased God .
by faith Noah , being warned of God of things not seen as yet , moved with fear , prepared an ark to the saving of his house ; by the which he condemned the world , and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith .
therefore sprang there even of one , and him as good as dead , so many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable .
these all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them afar off , and were persuaded of them , and embraced them , and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt : for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward .
a double minded man is unstable in all his ways .
but be ye doers of the word , and not hearers only , deceiving your own selves .
for if any be a hearer of the word , and not a doer , he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass :
and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing , and say unto him , Sit thou here in a good place ; and say to the poor , Stand thou there , or sit here under my footstool :
are ye not then partial in yourselves , and are become judges of evil thoughts ?
if ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself , ye do well :
yea , a man may say , Thou hast faith , and I have works : shew me thy faith without thy works , and I will shew thee my faith by my works .
ye see then how that by works a man is justified , and not by faith only .
and he prayed again , and the heaven gave rain , and the earth brought forth her fruit .
ye also , as lively stones , are built up a spiritual house , an holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to God by Jesus Christ .
likewise , ye wives , be in subjection to your own husbands ; that , if any obey not the word , they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives ;
for he that will love life , and see good days , let him refrain his tongue from evil , and his lips that they speak no guile :
forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh , arm yourselves likewise with the same mind : for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin ;
but there were false prophets also among the people , even as there shall be false teachers among you , who privily shall bring in damnable heresies , even denying the Lord that bought them , and bring upon themselves swift destruction .
if we say that we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
hereby perceive we the love of God , because he laid down his life for us : and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren .
but whoso hath this world 's good , and seeth his brother have need , and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him , how dwelleth the love of God in him ?
herein is love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us , and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins .
and this commandment have we from him , That he who loveth God love his brother also .
for there are three that bear record in heaven , the Father , the Word , and the Holy Ghost : and these three are one .
he that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself : he that believeth not God hath made him a liar ; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son .
I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth , as we have received a commandment from the Father .
look to yourselves , that we lose not those things which we have wrought , but that we receive a full reward .
how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time , who should walk after their own ungodly lusts .
the Revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave unto him , to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass ; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John :
I was in the Spirit on the Lord 's day , and heard behind me a great voice , as of a trumpet ,
and he had in his right hand seven stars : and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword : and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength .
nevertheless I have somewhat against thee , because thou hast left thy first love .
I know thy works , and tribulation , and poverty , ( but thou art rich ) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews , and are not , but are the synagogue of Satan .
I know thy works , and charity , and service , and faith , and thy patience , and thy works ; and the last to be more than the first .
thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments ; and they shall walk with me in white : for they are worthy .
I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire , that thou mayest be rich ; and white raiment , that thou mayest be clothed , and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear ; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve , that thou mayest see .
and immediately I was in the spirit : and , behold , a throne was set in heaven , and one sat on the throne .
and round about the throne were four and twenty seats : and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting , clothed in white raiment ; and they had on their heads crowns of gold .
the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne , and worship him that liveth for ever and ever , and cast their crowns before the throne , saying ,
and when he had opened the third seal , I heard the third beast say , Come and see . and I beheld , and lo a black horse ; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand .
and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together ; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places .
and I said unto him , Sir , thou knowest . and he said to me , These are they which came out of great tribulation , and have washed their robes , and made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
neither repented they of their murders , nor of their sorceries , nor of their fornication , nor of their thefts .
and he had in his hand a little book open : and he set his right foot upon the sea , and his left foot on the earth ,
and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven ,
and the seventh angel sounded ; and there were great voices in heaven , saying , The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord , and of his Christ ; and he shall reign for ever and ever .
and the four and twenty elders , which sat before God on their seats , fell upon their faces , and worshipped God ,
and the temple of God was opened in heaven , and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament : and there were lightnings , and voices , and thunderings , and an earthquake , and great hail .
and there appeared another wonder in heaven ; and behold a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and seven crowns upon his heads .
and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven , Now is come salvation , and strength , and the kingdom of our God , and the power of his Christ : for the accuser of our brethren is cast down , which accused them before our God day and night .
and the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard , and his feet were as the feet of a bear , and his mouth as the mouth of a lion : and the dragon gave him his power , and his seat , and great authority .
and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God , to blaspheme his name , and his tabernacle , and them that dwell in heaven .
and I heard a voice from heaven , as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of a great thunder : and I heard the voice of Harpers harping with their harps :
and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me , Write , Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth : yea , saith the Spirit , that they may rest from their labours ; and their works do follow them .
and he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth ; and the earth was reaped .
and another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven , he also having a sharp sickle .
and the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth , and gathered the vine of the earth , and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God .
and I saw another sign in heaven , great and marvellous , seven angels having the seven last plagues ; for in them is filled up the wrath of God .
who shall not fear thee , O Lord , and glorify thy name ? for thou only art holy : for all nations shall come and worship before thee ; for thy judgments are made manifest .
and the first went , and poured out his vial upon the earth ; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast , and upon them which worshipped his image .
and the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea ; and it became as the blood of a dead man : and every living soul died in the sea .
and the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters ; and they became blood .
and the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun ; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire .
and the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast ; and his kingdom was full of darkness ; and they gnawed their tongues for pain ,
and blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores , and repented not of their deeds .
and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates ; and the water thereof was dried up , that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared .
behold , I come as a thief . blessed is he that watcheth , and keepeth his garments , lest he walk naked , and they see his shame .
and the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee , and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee , and thou shalt find them no more at all .
and after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven , saying , Alleluia ; Salvation , and glory , and honour , and power , unto the Lord our God :
and the sea gave up the dead which were in it ; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them : and they were judged every man according to their works .
in the midst of the street of it , and on either side of the river , was there the tree of life , which bare twelve manner of fruits , and yielded her fruit every month : and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
