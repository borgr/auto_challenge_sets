'@@ Let me see what was it ? ' he thought , trying to recall his dream .
there were many other delightful things which I can '@@ t just get hold of - can '@@ t catch now I 'm awake . '
'@@ Oh dear , dear , dear ! ' he gro@@ an@@ ed recalling what had happened .
and the details of his quarrel with his wife , his inextr@@ icable position , and , worst of all , his guilt , rose up in his imagination .
he could no longer find for@@ get@@ fulness in sleep , at any rate not before night , could not go back to the music and the songs of the little dec@@ an@@ ter @@@ -@@ @ women , consequently he must seek for@@ get@@ fulness in the dream of life .
the bell was answered immediately by his old friend and val@@ et , Matthew , who brought in his clothes , boots , and a tel@@ eg@@ ram .
'@@ Any papers from the Office ? ' asked O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , as he took the tel@@ eg@@ ram and sat down before the looking @@@ -@@ @ glass .
'@@ They 're on your table , ' answered Matthew with a questioning and sympath@@ izing glance at his master - adding after a pause with a sly smile : ' some one has called from the job@@ master 's . '
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky did not answer , but glanced at Matthew 's face in the looking @@@ -@@ @ glass . from their looks , as they met in the glass , it was evident that they understood one another .
he t@@ ore open the tel@@ eg@@ ram and read it , gu@@ essing at the words , which ( as so often happens in tele@@ grams ) were mis@@ sp@@ elt , and his face bri@@ ghtened .
'@@ Matthew , my sister Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna is coming to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row , ' he said , mo@@ tioning away for a moment the shiny pl@@ ump hand of the bar@@ ber , which was sha@@ ving a rosy path between his long cur@@ ly whis@@ kers .
'@@ It 's me , sir , ' answered a firm and pleasant woman 's voice , and Mat@@ ren@@ a Fil@@ im@@ on@@ ovna , the children 's nurse thrust her stern po@@ ck@@ marked face in at the door .
she suffers dread@@ fully ; it 's p@@ iti@@ ful to see her , and everything in the house is top@@ sy @@@ -@@ @ tur@@ vy .
Matthew blew some invisible spec@@ k off the shirt which he held ready gathered up like a horse 's collar , and with evident pleasure invested with it his master 's carefully tended body .
then he heard the sound of two chil@@ dish voices outside the door , and recognized them as the voices of his el@@ dest daughter , T@@ anya , and of his little boy G@@ ris@@ ha .
'@@ How 's M@@ ama ? ' he asked , passing his hand over his daughter 's smooth delicate little neck , as he smil@@ ingly said ' Good morning ' in answer to the little boy 's greeting .
he was conscious of not caring as much for the boy as for the girl but did his best to treat them both alike . the boy felt this and did not respond to his father 's cold smile .
'@@ i don '@@ t know , ' she said . ' she said we were not to have any lessons , but must walk with Miss H@@ ull to Grand@@ mam@@ ma 's . '
'@@ the carriage is ready , ' said Matthew , ' and there is a woman on business waiting for you . '
'@@ But I must give you time to finish your coffee , ' answered Matthew in his friendly ru@@ de tone , with which it was impossible to be angry .
she pressed her lips together and a cheek @@@ -@@ @ muscle t@@ wit@@ ched on the right side of her pale nervous face .
she wished to go away , but stagg@@ ered and held on to the back of a chair to support herself .
'@@ But what 's to be done ? - what 's to be done ? ' said he , in a pit@@ eous voice , hardly knowing what he was saying , and sinking his head lower and lower .
to me you are det@@ est@@ able , disgu@@ sting - a stranger , yes , a perfect stranger ! ' she uttered that word stranger , so terrible to herself , with angu@@ ish and hatred .
she seemed to be trying to recoll@@ ect herself , as if she did not know where she was or what she had to do . then she rose quickly and moved toward the door .
I am going away to @@@ -@@ @ day , and you may live here with your mistress ! '
for a few seconds O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky stood alone ; then he wiped his eyes , sigh@@ ed , and expanding his chest went out of the room .
'@@ En@@ ough or not , we shall have to manage , that 's clear , ' said Matthew , closing the carriage door and stepping back into the por@@ ch .
having arrived at his destination , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky ; respec@@ tfully followed by the door @@@ -@@ @ keeper bearing his portfolio , entered his little private room , put on his uniform , and came out into the Office .
you know it is very , very important for me to have a talk with you , ' said Levin .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , who had long known that Levin was in love with his , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's , sister @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law Kit@@ ty , smiled very slightly and his eyes spark@@ led mer@@ r@@ ily .
in his student days he very nearly fell in love with the el@@ dest daughter , Dol@@ ly ; but a marriage was soon after arranged between her and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
moreover , his former relation to Kit@@ ty had been that of a grown @@@ -@@ @ up man towards a child whose brother 's friend he was , and this seemed an additional obstacle in love 's path .
the question was the fashionable one , whether a definite line exists between psychological and physiological phenomena in human activity ; and if so , where it lies ?
when Levin entered , Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich greeted him with the col@@ dly aff@@ able smile he bestowed on everybody and , having introduced him to the professor , went on with the discussion .
the small spectac@@ led man with the narrow forehead interrupted the conversation a moment to say , ' how do you do ' to Levin and , paying no further attention to him , went on talking .
Levin sat down to wait till the professor should go , but soon became interested in the subject of their conversation .
the most fundamental perception - that of existence - is not received through the senses , for there is no special organ to convey that perception . '
but here again it seemed to Levin that having reached the most important matter they avoided it ; and he made up his mind to ask the professor a question .
'@@ In@@ capable ! ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev . ' no , you don '@@ t look at it from the right point of view . '
Levin read the note , written in a curious but familiar hand : ' I hum@@ bly beg you to leave me alone .
when Levin had read the note , holding it in his hand , he remained standing in front of Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev without lifting his head .
a struggle was going on within him between the desire to forget his unfortunate brother for the present , and the consciousness that this would be wrong .
having got the address from Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev 's foot@@ man Levin thought of going at once to see his brother ; but , on reflection , decided to put off the visit till the evening .
on that day of the week and at that hour , people belonging to the same set and acquainted with one another , met on the ice .
yet skaters appeared quite calmly to gain on her , to catch her up , and even speak to her , and quite independently of her to am@@ use themselves enjoying the excellent ice and the fine weather .
Nicholas Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky , Kit@@ ty 's cousin , in a short jacket , tight trous@@ ers , with sk@@ ates on his feet , was sitting on a bench , and seeing Levin , called out to him .
having turned the corner , she pushed off with an elastic little foot , gli@@ ded straight up to Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky , and catching hold of him with her hand , nodded smil@@ ingly to Levin .
there is a tradition here that you are the best sk@@ ater , ' she said , fl@@ icking off with a small black @@@ -@@ @ glo@@ ved hand some ho@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ frost crystals that had fallen on her mu@@ ff .
'@@ i 'll go and put them on at once , ' he said , and went to hire some sk@@ ates .
help me , O Lord ! ' thought Levin , ha@@ st@@ ening toward the old French@@ woman with the grey cur@@ ls ; who sat on one of the ben@@ ches .
he had not the fain@@ test recoll@@ ection of it , but she was fond of the joke and had laughed at it for the last ten years .
he then flew down the slope and gli@@ ded along the ice without so much as changing the easy position of his arms .
he caught his foot on the last step , but , scarcely touching the ice with his hand , made a violent effort , regained his balance , and sk@@ ated away laughing .
when he saw Kit@@ ty who was going away , and her mother who had met her on the steps , Levin , fl@@ ushed with the violent exercise , stood still and considered .
he then took off his sk@@ ates and over@@ took mother and daughter at the gates of the Gardens .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky crum@@ pled his star@@ ched n@@ ap@@ kin and pushed a corner of it inside his wai@@ st@@ coat , then , with his arms comfortably on the table , attacked the oy@@ sters .
'@@ i can '@@ t help it , ' replied Levin . ' put yourself in my place - look at it from a country fellow 's point of view !
but here people purpos@@ ely let their nails grow until they begin to cur@@ l , and have little s@@ auc@@ ers for stu@@ ds to make it quite impossible for them to use their hands ! '
the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys asked me again and again , just as if I ought to know all about you .
'@@ no , not behind me , but you have the future and I have the present ; and even that only half @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ half ! '
'@@ There is nothing I should like better , ' said he , ' nothing !
'@@ W@@ ait a bit : you must take some sauce , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , stopping Levin 's hand that was pushing away the sauce @@@ -@@ @ boat .
at these words a sudden smile bri@@ ghtened Levin 's face , the kind of smile that is not far from tears of ten@@ derness .
'@@ ah , but all the same , ' said Levin , ' looking back at my life , I trem@@ ble and curse and bit@@ terly regret ...
as I have got to know him now , he turns out to be both educated and very clever - a man who will go far . '
'@@ Exc@@ use me , but really I ... it 's quite incomprehensible to me . it 's as if ... just as incomprehensible as if I , after eating my fill here , went into a b@@ aker 's shop and stole a roll . '
'@@ It 's all very well for you to talk like that - it 's like that gentleman in D@@ ick@@ ens , who with his left hand threw all difficult questions over his right shoulder .
a man hardly has time to turn round , before he feels that he can no longer love his wife in that way , whatever his regard for her may be .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky had more than once experienced this kind of acute e@@ strang@@ ement instead of union following a dinner with a friend , and knew what to do in such a case .
'@@ the bill ! ' he shouted and went out into the dining @@@ -@@ @ hall , where he immediately saw an aide @@@ -@@ @ de @@@ -@@ @ camp of his acquaintance , and entered into conversation with him about an actress and her protector .
and immediately in conversation with the aide @@@ -@@ @ de @@@ -@@ @ camp O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky felt relief and rest after the talk with Levin , who always demanded of him too great a mental and spiritual strain .
V@@ ron@@ sky was openly attentive to Kit@@ ty when they met at balls , danced with her , and came to the house , so there could be no doubt as to the seriousness of his intentions .
at least so it seemed to the Princess . but in her daughters ' case she experienced how far from easy and simple the apparently easy business of mar@@ rying off a daughter really was .
the Princess had grown used to this in respect to her older daughters , but now she felt that her husband 's punc@@ tili@@ ousness had more justification .
the French way , of parents deciding a daughter 's fate , was not accepted , and was even condemned .
the English way , of giving a girl perfect freedom , was also rejected , and would have been impossible in Russian Society .
that is why the Princess was more anxious about Kit@@ ty than she had been about her elder daughters .
she saw that Kit@@ ty was in love with him , but consol@@ ed herself with the thought that V@@ ron@@ sky was an honest man and therefore would not act in such a way .
at the same time she knew that the freedom now permitted made it easy for a man to turn a girl 's head , and knew how lightly men regarded an offence of that kind .
during THE interval between dinner and the beginning of the evening party , Kit@@ ty experienced something resembling a young man 's feelings before a battle .
on the other hand when she pic@@ tured to herself a future with V@@ ron@@ sky a brilliant vision of happiness rose up before her , while a future with Levin appeared wrapped in mist .
at half @@@ -@@ @ past seven , as soon as she had come down into the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room , the foot@@ man announced ' Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich Levin ! '
he too sat down until the arrival of other guests should enable him to get away unnoticed .
her constant and favourite amusement was to make fun of him .
'@@ i love it when he looks down at me from the height of his dignity , or breaks off his clever conversation because I am too stupid , or when he shows his con@@ des@@ cension toward me .
'@@ no , Princess , I am no longer on the Zem@@ st@@ vo , ' he answered , ' I have come to Moscow for a few days . '
but I 'll draw him out , I do love to make a fool of him when Kit@@ ty 's about , and I will . '
V@@ ron@@ sky was a dark stur@@ d@@ ily @@@ -@@ @ built man of medium height , with a good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured , handsome , exceedingly quiet and firm face .
everything about his face and figure - from his black closely @@@ -@@ @ cro@@ pped hair and freshly @@@ -@@ @ sha@@ ven chin to his wide , brand @@@ -@@ @ new uniform - was simple and at the same time elegant .
having greeted and spoken a few words to every one else , he sat down without having once looked at Levin , who had not taken his eyes off him .
and Naples and Sor@@ ren@@ to are pleasant only for a short stay , and it is there that one thinks of Russia , and l@@ ongs especially for the Russian countryside .
Levin wished to join in the general conversation , but found it impossible , and kept saying to himself , ' Now I will go , ' yet he did not go , but waited for something indefinite .
'@@ Very well , next Saturday , ' replied the Countess Nord@@ ston . ' and you ; Mr. Levin , do you believe in it ? ' she asked , turning to him .
we admit the existence of electricity , which we don '@@ t understand , why can '@@ t there be other forces which we do not yet know , but which ... '
just as the others began settling round the table and Levin was about to go , the old Prince came in , and having greeted the ladies he turned to Levin .
V@@ ron@@ sky 's un@@ fl@@ in@@ ching eye glanced in aston@@ ishment at the old Prince , and slightly smiling he at once began talking to the Countess Nord@@ ston about the ball that was to take place the next week .
this one is a little Petersburg f@@ op . they are machine @@@ -@@ @ made by the dozen , all to one pattern , and all mere rub@@ bish .
'@@ i know this much , ' the Princess interrupted him , ' that if I were to listen to what you say we should never see our daughter married , and we had better go and live in the country . '
no , certainly not , but a young man and an excellent young man falls in love with Kit@@ ty , and she too seems ... '
I can recognize a man who has serious intentions - such as Levin - and I can see through a we@@ ather@@ cock like that pop@@ inj@@ ay who only wishes to am@@ use himself . '
and having made the sign of the cross over one another and kis@@ sed , feeling that each of them retained their individual opinions , the couple separated for the night .
his mother in her youth had been a brilliant Society woman , and during her married life and especially in her wi@@ do@@ wh@@ ood had had many love affairs , known to everybody .
on leaving that Corps as a very young and brilliant officer he at once joined the swim of the wealthy military Petersburg set .
in Moscow , after this luxurious course of Petersburg life , he experienced for the first time the delight of intim@@ acy with a sweet , innocent Society girl who fell in love with him .
I feel myself better and pu@@ rer , I feel I have a heart and that there is much that is good in me .
'@@ i don '@@ t know how it is that all Muscov@@ ites , present company of course excep@@ ted , ' V@@ ron@@ sky put in jo@@ kingly , ' are so abrupt .
the approach of the train was made more and more evident by the increasing bust@@ le and preparation on the platform and the arrival of people who had come to meet the train .
it was as if an excess of vitality so filled her whole being that it betrayed itself against her will , now in her smile , now in the light of her eyes .
his mother , a thin old woman with black eyes and cur@@ led hair , scre@@ wed up her eyes as she recognized her son and her thin lips smiled slightly .
'@@ She is very charming , is@@ n '@@ t she ? ' said the Countess , referring to Mrs. K@@ aren@@ ina . ' her husband put her into the compartment with me and I was very pleased .
'@@ There , Countess , you have met your son and I my brother , ' she said , ' and I have exhausted my stock of stories and should have had nothing more to tell you . '
you are one of those charming women with whom it is nice to talk , and nice to be silent . but please don '@@ t fre@@ t about your son , you can '@@ t expect never to be parted . '
he pressed the little hand , and the firm grip with which she shook his gave him unusual pleasure .
the old major @@@ -@@ @ dom@@ o , who had accompanied the Countess on her journey , came in and announced that everything was ready , and the Countess rose to go .
V@@ ron@@ sky gave his arm to his mother , but , just as they were coming out of the carriage , several people ran past them with frightened faces .
the ladies re @@@ -@@ @ entered the carriage , while V@@ ron@@ sky and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky followed the crowd , to find out about the accident .
a watch@@ man , either ti@@ p@@ sy or too much mu@@ ff@@ led up because of the severe frost , had not heard a tram that was being shun@@ ted , and had been run over .
when he returned a few minutes later O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky was already talking to the Countess about the new opera singer , while she was impati@@ ently gl@@ ancing at the door in expectation of her son .
they went together , V@@ ron@@ sky walking in front with his mother , Mrs. K@@ aren@@ ina following with her brother .
'@@ For the widow , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , sh@@ ru@@ gging his shoulders . ' I don '@@ t understand what need there is to ask . '
Mrs. K@@ aren@@ ina got into her brother 's carriage , and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky noticed with surprise that her lips were trembling and that it was with difficulty she kept back her tears .
on reaching his house , he helped his sister out of the carriage , pressed her hand , and drove off to his office .
it was true that , as far as she could remember her visit to the K@@ aren@@ ins in Petersburg , she had not liked their house : there seemed to be something false in the tone of their family life .
and when she heard soft steps and the ru@@ st@@ le of pet@@ ti@@ coats already in the doorway , she looked round with an expression not of pleasure but of surprise on her care@@ worn face .
dear me , how he has grown ! ' said Anna , and having kis@@ sed him , she stood with her eyes fixed on Dol@@ ly and bl@@ ushed . ' no , please do not let us go anywhere . '
she not only mentioned them all by name , but remembered the years and even the months of their births , their characters , and what illnesses they had had ; and Dol@@ ly could not help appreci@@ ating this .
what is the best way of acting in this dreadful position ? that is what one has to consider . '
I know they say husbands tell their wives how they have lived , but Steve ... ' She corrected herself .
'@@ But Stephen Ark@@ ady@@ evich never told me anything . you will hardly believe it , but up to now I thought I was the only woman he had ever known .
to be fully convinced of one 's happiness and suddenly ... ' continued Dol@@ ly , suppressing her so@@ bs , ' to read a letter , his letter to his mistress , my children 's govern@@ ess . no , it is too horrible ! '
'@@ Yes , I understand that his position is dreadful ; it is worse for the guilty than for the innocent one , ' she said , ' if he feels that the mis@@ fortune all comes from his fault .
I have served his purpose and lost all I had in the service , and of course a fresh , good @@@ -@@ @ for @@@ -@@ @ nothing creature now pleas@@ es him better .
you are so deeply hurt , so upset , that you see many things in the wrong light . '
they manage in some way to hold these women in contempt and don '@@ t let them interfere with the family .
she spent the earlier part of the day with Dol@@ ly and the children , and sent a note to her brother to be sure and come home to dinner .
after dinner , when Dol@@ ly had gone to her own room , Anna got up quickly and went to her brother who was just lighting a ci@@ gar .
here , take this , ' she said , turning to T@@ anya who was drawing off a ring which fitted loosely on her aunt 's small tap@@ ering finger .
G@@ ris@@ ha , please don '@@ t pull so hard , it is all in a t@@ angle already , ' she said , arranging a loose lock of hair with which G@@ ris@@ ha was playing .
there 's Miss H@@ ull calling you to tea , ' she went on , dis@@ engaging herself from the children and dispat@@ ching them to the dining @@@ -@@ @ room .
'@@ She particularly wished me to go and see her , ' continued Anna . ' I shall be glad to see the old lady again , and will go to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row .
'@@ all together ! ' said Anna laughing and running to meet them , and putting her arms round them she tum@@ bled the whole heap of children - struggling and shri@@ e@@ king joy@@ fully - on to the floor .
the B@@ ALL H@@ AD ON@@ LY J@@ UST BE@@ G@@ UN when Kit@@ ty and her mother asc@@ ended the broad staircase which was delu@@ ged with light , decorated with flow@@ ering plants , and occupied by pow@@ dered foot@@ men in red li@@ ver@@ ies .
Kit@@ ty smiled , here at the ball , when she caught sight of it again in the mirror .
her eyes shone and she could not keep her rosy lips from smiling at the consciousness of her attractive appearance .
she looked about for some one to hold her fan and the mistress of the house took it from her with a smile .
bending her left arm she put her hand on his shoulder , and her little feet in their pink shoes began moving quickly , lightly , and rhyth@@ m@@ ically in time with the music , over the smooth par@@ quet floor .
the only noticeable things about it were the wil@@ ful ring@@ lets that always escaped at her temples and on the n@@ ape of her neck and added to her beauty .
'@@ Well , if it is impossible not to dance to @@@ -@@ @ night , let us dance , ' she said taking no notice of V@@ ron@@ sky 's bow and quickly putting her hand on Kor@@ sun@@ sky 's shoulder .
'@@ Par@@ don , pardon , a wal@@ tz - a wal@@ tz , ' shouted Kor@@ sun@@ sky from the other end of the room , and seizing the first girl within reach he himself began dancing .
she was sure that she would dance the ma@@ z@@ ur@@ ka with him as at previous balls , and she refused five other partners for that dance , saying that she was already engaged .
she had not come across Anna since the beginning of the ball , and now she suddenly saw her again in a different and unexpected light .
'@@ no , it is not the admiration of the crowd that intox@@ icates her , but the rap@@ ture of one , and that one is ... can it be he ? '
only the thorough training she had had enabled and obliged her to do what was expected of her , that is , to dance , to answer the questions put to her , to talk , and even to smile .
but before the ma@@ z@@ ur@@ ka began , when the chairs were already being placed for it , and several couples moved from the small to the large ball @@@ -@@ @ room , Kit@@ ty was for a moment seized with despair .
and she saw them with her far @@@ -@@ @ sighted eyes , she saw them close by , too ; when they met in the dance , and the more she saw of them the su@@ rer she was that the blow had fallen .
on V@@ ron@@ sky 's face , usually so firm and self @@@ -@@ @ possessed she noticed that expression of bewil@@ der@@ ment and submission which had so surprised her - an expression like that of an intelligent dog when it feels guilty .
in the middle of the ma@@ z@@ ur@@ ka , performing a complicated figure newly @@@ -@@ @ invented by Kor@@ sun@@ sky , Anna stepped into the middle of the room and chose two men and two ladies , one of whom was Kit@@ ty , to join her .
of course , from Pro@@ k@@ of@@ y 's point of view , who saw him in a r@@ agged coat and ti@@ p@@ sy , he is a des@@ pic@@ able fellow ; but I know him from another side .
Levin went up to a lamp @@@ -@@ @ post and read his brother 's address which he had in his pocket @@@ -@@ @ book , and then hired a sle@@ dge .
he remembered an affair with a shar@@ per to whom his brother had lost money , and whom he had first given a promis@@ sory note and then prosecuted on a charge of fraud .
he was te@@ ased and called ' Noah ' and ' monk , ' and then when he broke loose no one helped him , but all turned away from him with horror and dis@@ gust .
his hair was thinner but the same straight mou@@ st@@ ache covered his lips ; and the same eyes with their peculiar , naive gaze looked out at the new @@@ -@@ @ com@@ er .
and our society has so shaped itself that the more the people work the richer the merchants and land@@ owners will become , while the people will remain beasts of burden for ever .
'@@ Yes , of course , ' said Constan@@ tine , looking int@@ ently at the hec@@ tic flush which had appeared on his brother 's face below its prominent cheek bones .
'@@ And so we are starting a lock@@ s@@ mi@@ ths ' Association , in which all the products and the profits and , above all , the instruments of production will be common property . '
'@@ Have you read his article ? ' he said , turning to K@@ rit@@ sky again , sitting down to the table and clearing away from it a heap of half @@@ -@@ @ filled cigarettes to make room .
but it is a different matter with me . I see through his thought , and therefore know why it is weak . '
'@@ If you want my full confession about it , I will tell you that I take no side in your quarrel with Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich .
M@@ asha promised to write to Constan@@ tine in case of need , and to try to persuade Nicholas to go and live with him .
secondly , he would never again allow himself to be carried away by passion , the re@@ pul@@ sive memory of which had so tor@@ m@@ ented him when he was making up his mind to propose .
a light fell on the snow @@@ -@@ @ covered space in front of the house from the windows of the room of his old nurse Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na , who now acted as his house@@ keeper .
L@@ aska , a set@@ ter bit@@ ch , ran out too , almost throwing Kuz@@ ma off his feet , and wh@@ ined and rub@@ bed herself against Levin 's knees , jumping up and wishing but not daring to put her front pa@@ ws on his chest .
when he saw all this , he was overcome by a mom@@ entary doubt of the possibility of starting the new life of which he had been dreaming on his way .
his ste@@ ward entered and said that , ' the Lord be thanked , ' everything was all right , but that the buck@@ wheat had burned in the new drying kil@@ n .
the ste@@ ward had always been against the new kil@@ n , and now proclaimed with suppressed triumph that the buck@@ wheat had got burnt .
there was a warm ste@@ aming smell of man@@ ure when the frozen door opened , and the cows , astonished at the un@@ accustomed light of the lan@@ tern , began moving on their clean straw .
Vasily Fed@@ or@@ ich , is@@ n '@@ t she fine ? ' he said , turning to the ste@@ ward , and quite for@@ giving him for the buck@@ wheat under the influence of his satisfaction about the cal@@ f .
it W@@ AS A large OL@@ D @@@ -@@ @ fashioned HO@@ USE , and though only Levin was living in it , he used and heated the whole of it .
Stephen O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky was not dining at home , but promised to be back at seven to see his sister off .
her eyes shone peculi@@ arly and kept filling with tears . ' I did not want to leave Petersburg , and now I do not want to leave here . '
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , sm@@ elling of wine and ci@@ gars , with his face red and happy , came in late , just as she was about to start .
Ann@@ ush@@ ka was already do@@ zing , her broad hands , with a hole in one of the gloves , holding the red bag on her lap .
but there was nothing to be done , so she forced herself to read , while her little hand to@@ yed with the smooth paper @@@ -@@ @ knife .
'@@ Well , what of it ? ' she finally said to herself with decision , changing her position on the seat . ' what does it signi@@ fy ?
to get over it she rose , threw off her wrap , and took off the cape of her coat .
she asked Ann@@ ush@@ ka to give her the cape she had removed and a sha@@ w@@ l , and putting them on she moved to the door .
a blu@@ stering storm W@@ AS rushing and whist@@ ling between the wheels of the train and round the pillars and the corners of the station .
though she could remember neither his nor her own words , she instinc@@ tively felt that that mom@@ entary conversation had drawn them terribly near to one another , and this both frightened her and made her happy .
at once thoughts of home , her husband , her son , and the cares of the coming day and of those that would follow , bes@@ et her .
it was that ordinary well @@@ -@@ @ known feeling , as if she were dissem@@ bling , which she experienced in regard to her husband , but formerly she had not noticed it , while now she was clearly and painfully conscious of it .
when he had got out of the train at B@@ olo@@ go@@ e station to drink a glass of Sel@@ t@@ zer water and had seen Anna , he had involun@@ tarily at once told her just what he was thinking about it .
when he returned to the train , he kept recalling all the positions in which he had seen her , and all her words ; and in his imagination , causing his heart to stand still , floated pictures of a possible future .
K@@ aren@@ in 's g@@ ait , the sw@@ inging of his thi@@ gh@@ s , and his wide short feet , particularly offended V@@ ron@@ sky , who acknowledged only his own un@@ questionable right to love Anna .
he saw the husband and wife meet , and with the penetration of a lover he noticed the signs of slight embarrassment when she spoke to her husband .
by addressing himself thus to his wife he conveyed to V@@ ron@@ sky his wish to be alone with her , and turning to V@@ ron@@ sky he touched his hat . but V@@ ron@@ sky , addressing Anna , said :
'@@ You insist too much on your devotion , for me to value it greatly , ' she replied in the same play@@ ful tone , while she involun@@ tarily listened to the sound of V@@ ron@@ sky 's footsteps following them .
and , do you know , if I may advise , you should go and see her to @@@ -@@ @ day .
Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna was Anna 's husband 's friend and the centre of that set in Petersburg Society with which Anna , through her husband , was most closely connected .
now I Sh@@ an '@@ t have to dine alone , ' he went on , no longer in a ban@@ tering manner . ' you can '@@ t think how I used ... '
'@@ i am getting tired of breaking lan@@ ces us@@ el@@ essly in the cause of truth , and sometimes I feel quite un@@ str@@ ung .
'@@ This is all just as it was before , but how is it that I never noticed it before ? ' said Anna to herself . ' or is it that she is specially irrit@@ ated this morning ?
but it is really funny ; her aim is to do good , she is a Christian and yet she is always angry and always has enemies - all on account of Christianity and philanthrop@@ y ! '
after the Countess had left , a friend - a high official 's wife - arrived and gave Anna all the Petersburg news .
the feeling of ca@@ useless shame she had felt during the journey , and her agitation , had quite vanished .
K@@ aren@@ in returned FROM THE MIN@@ IS@@ TR@@ Y at four o 'clock , but , as often happened , he had no time to go up and see his wife .
at dinner he spoke a little about Moscow affairs with his wife , asking with an ir@@ on@@ ical smile after Stephen O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky ; but for the most part the conversation was general and dealt with Petersburg service and social affairs .
after dinner he spent half an hour with his guests , and then , having again with a smile pressed his wife 's hand , went away to the Council .
the d@@ res@@ sm@@ aker came to explain that it was better as she had done it , and Anna lost her tem@@ per to such a degree that she afterwards felt ashamed .
exactly at half @@@ -@@ @ past nine there was a ring at the front door , and he entered the room .
'@@ Yes , quite , ' she replied , and related everything that had happened from the beginning : her journey with the Countess V@@ ron@@ skaya , her arrival , the accident at the railway station .
'@@ Here , on the contrary , it has made quite a stir , ' he said with a self @@@ -@@ @ satisfied smile .
with the same self @@@ -@@ @ satisfied smile he told her about the ov@@ ations he had received on account of the en@@ ac@@ tment of that Statute .
she knew that in spite of his time being almost entirely absorbed by the duties of his post , he considered it incumbent on him to follow everything of importance that appeared in the world of thought .
he liked talking of Shakespeare , Rap@@ hael and Be@@ eth@@ oven , and about the importance of the new schools of poetry and music , which in his mind were all classified with very logical ex@@ acti@@ tude .
when H@@ E W@@ ENT TO Moscow , V@@ ron@@ sky had left his large flat on the Mor@@ skaya to his friend and favourite com@@ rade , Petr@@ itsky .
when he rang the bell , while still outside , he heard men 's laughter , a woman 's lis@@ ping voice , and Petr@@ itsky shouting : ' if it is one of the vill@@ ains , don '@@ t let him in ! '
Petr@@ itsky in his great coat , and Captain Kam@@ er@@ ovsky in full uniform probably straight from parade , sat on each side of her .
I hope you are pleased with this or@@ nament to your study , ' he added , pointing to the Bar@@ on@@ ess . ' of course , you know one another ? '
'@@ i should think so ! ' replied V@@ ron@@ sky with a mer@@ ry smile , as he pressed the Bar@@ on@@ ess 's small hand . ' of course : quite old friends . '
Kam@@ er@@ ovsky rose also , and , without waiting for him to go , V@@ ron@@ sky shook hands with him and went to his dressing @@@ -@@ @ room .
listening to Petr@@ itsky 's familiar tales , in the familiar surroundings of the house he had lived in for three years , V@@ ron@@ sky experienced the satisfaction of returning to his customary ca@@ reless Petersburg life .
'@@ Oh , about Bu@@ z@@ ul@@ ukov there is such a tale - splendid ! ' shouted Petr@@ itsky . ' you know his passion for balls ?
she sees our dear Bu@@ z@@ ul@@ ukov standing there ' - Petr@@ itsky im@@ itated the pose ' the Grand Duchess asks him for his helmet , but he won '@@ t let her have it !
toward THE EN@@ D OF THE WIN@@ TER a consultation was held at the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys ' which was intended to as@@ certain the state of Kit@@ ty 's health and to decide what should be done to restore her failing strength .
he saw that it was waste of time to talk to him , and that the head in this house was the mother .
'@@ But in favour of a journey abroad I should like to mention the change of habits , and the removal from surroundings which awaken memories .
the celebrity informed the Princess ( his sense of what was fitting suggested this to him ) that he would have to see the patient again .
such a discovery could now only deprive her of her accustomed family life , and she let herself be deceived , desp@@ ising him , and especially herself , for such weakness .
added to this the care of a large family worried her continually : either something went wrong with the feeding of the baby or the nurse left , or , as now , one of the children fell ill .
one can '@@ t get at one 's real daughter , but only ca@@ resses the hair of expired females .
when Kit@@ ty , in tears , had left the room , Dol@@ ly , with her mother@@ ly habit of mind , at once saw that here a woman 's task lay before her , and prepared to fulfil it .
she took off her bon@@ net and , having mentally rolled up her sle@@ eves , prepared for action .
'@@ i am going home now and shall have to shut myself up , and you won '@@ t be able to come to me , ' said Dol@@ ly , sitting down beside her sister . ' I want to talk to you . '
she turned on her chair , bl@@ ushed , and began rapidly moving her fingers , pressing now with one hand and now with the other the buck@@ le of a belt she was holding .
and it is my sister who says that to me . my sister who imag@@ ines ... that ... that she sympath@@ izes with me ! ...
the mention of Levin seemed to deprive Kit@@ ty of the last fragments of self @@@ -@@ @ control : she jumped up from her chair , threw the buck@@ le on the floor , and rapidly g@@ es@@ ticul@@ ating with her hands she began :
M@@ ama takes me to a ball : and it seems to me she only takes me there to marry me off as quickly as possible and get rid of me .
formerly to go anywhere in a ball @@@ -@@ @ dress was just a pleasure to me . I used to like myself in it ; but now I feel ashamed and uncomfortable .
and Kit@@ ty insisted on having her own way , went to her sister 's , and nur@@ sed the children all through the scar@@ let fever that really attacked them .
the two sisters nur@@ sed all the six children successfully through the illness , but Kit@@ ty 's health did not improve , and in L@@ ent the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys went abroad .
K@@ aren@@ in set great value on this circle , and Anna , who knew how to get on with every one , had during the first part of her life in Petersburg made friends in it too .
he knew very well that he ran no risk of appearing ridiculous either in Bet@@ sy 's eyes or in the eyes of Society people generally .
I 'll give you a hundred or a thousand gu@@ esses - and you won '@@ t find out !
'@@ What ? from N@@ il@@ sson ? ' asked Bet@@ sy , quite horri@@ fied , though she could not have distinguished N@@ il@@ sson 's voice from that of a chorus girl .
they see that a pretty woman in a hired sle@@ dge is passing them , looking at them , and laughing and nod@@ ding to them - at any rate they think so .
they only manage to see a pair of red lips beneath a short veil , and lovely little feet ... '
well , the young men go into their com@@ rade 's flat . he was giving a farewell dinner .
no one knows ; but their host 's foot@@ man , in answer to their question whether " girls " lived there , replies that there are a lot of them there@@ abouts .
a maid opens the door ; they give her the letter and assure her that they are both so much in love that they will die at once on the door@@ step .
the tit@@ ular Coun@@ cill@@ or lo@@ dges a complaint , and I turn into a peac@@ emaker - and what a peac@@ emaker ! ...
" I agree that they acted badly , but beg you to consider that it was a mistake ; consider their youth ; besides which the young men had just d@@ ined .
they repent from the bottom of their hearts , and ask you to forgive their fault . "
these officers , in their sle@@ dge , rac@@ ed after her ; she became frightened , and feeling still more un@@ well ran up the stairs to her flat .
W@@ end@@ en himself , having returned from his office and hearing the front @@@ -@@ @ door bell and voices , went out , saw the ti@@ p@@ sy officers with the letter , and hu@@ st@@ led them out .
V@@ ron@@ sky realized how un@@ grateful a task it was - that a du@@ el was out of the question , and that everything must be done to soften the tit@@ ular Coun@@ cill@@ or and h@@ ush up the affair .
having reached the French Theatre , V@@ ron@@ sky went out into the fo@@ yer with the C.@@ O. , and informed him of his success or lack of success .
wonderful ! ' he went on , referring to the new French actress . ' however often one sees her , she is new each day .
the conversation in both circles , as always happens at first , hes@@ itated for a few minutes , was interrupted by greetings , recogn@@ itions , and offers of tea , and seemed to be seeking something to settle on .
'@@ She is wonder@@ fully good as an actress , one sees that she has studied K@@ aul@@ bach , ' remarked an att@@ ach@@ é in the circle round the ambassador 's wife . ' did you notice how she fell ... '
this was the Princess My@@ ag@@ k@@ aya , notorious for her simplicity and the rough@@ ness of her manners , and nick@@ named l '@@ en@@ f@@ ant terrible .
'@@ Have you heard ? that that Mal@@ ty@@ sh@@ ch@@ eva woman also - not the daughter but the mother - is having a di@@ able rose costume made for herself ? '
'@@ What ? have you been to the Sch@@ uz@@ bur@@ gs ? ' asked the host@@ ess from her place by the sam@@ ov@@ ar .
he is such a remarkable man , ' said the ambassador 's wife . ' my husband says there are few statesmen like him in Europe . '
'@@ no one is satisfied with his position , but every one is satisfied with his w@@ it , ' remarked the att@@ ach@@ é , qu@@ oting some French lines .
'@@ But I don '@@ t even think of blaming her ! ' Anna 's friend said , justi@@ fying herself .
but immediately , nod@@ ding rapidly to her acquaintances and pressing the hands extended to her , she turned again to her host@@ ess :
'@@ When I was young I was in love with a ch@@ or@@ ister , ' said Princess My@@ ag@@ k@@ aya . ' I don '@@ t know whether it did me any good . '
'@@ i ask only one thing : I ask the right to hope and suffer as I do now ; but if even that is impossible , command me to disappear , and I will do it .
'@@ Your Hotel R@@ amb@@ ou@@ il@@ let is in full mu@@ ster , ' said he , gl@@ ancing round the whole company , ' the gr@@ aces and the M@@ uses . '
after half an hour 's stay K@@ aren@@ in went up to his wife and suggested that they should go home together ; but , without looking at him , she answered that she would stay to sup@@ per .
she gave him her hand , and with her quick elastic step went past the hall @@@ -@@ @ porter and vanished into the carriage .
with the book under his arm he went up@@ stairs ; but to @@@ -@@ @ night , instead of his usual thoughts and calculations about his official affairs , his mind was full of his wife and of something unpleasant that had happened concerning her .
he now experienced a sensation such as a man might feel who , while quietly crossing a bridge over an abyss , suddenly sees that the bridge is being taken to pieces and that he is facing the abyss .
'@@ i must think it over , come to a decision , and throw it off , ' he said aloud .
as head of the family I am the person whose duty it is to guide her , and who is therefore partly responsible ; I must show her the danger which I see , warn her , and even use my authority .
by the sound of her light step on the st@@ air he was aware of her approach and , though he was satisfied with his speech , he felt some apprehen@@ sion of the coming explanations .
her face shone with a vivid glow , but it was not a joy@@ ous glow - it resem@@ bled the terrible glow of a confl@@ agr@@ ation on a dark night .
more than that , he knew from her tone that she was not ashamed of this , but seemed to be saying frankly : ' yes , it is closed , and so it should be and will be in future . '
as she spoke she wondered at her quietly natural tone and at her correct choice of words .
your feelings concern your own conscience , but it is my duty to you , to myself , and to God , to point out to you your duties .
Oh dear ! and as ill @@@ -@@ @ luck will have it , I am dread@@ fully sleep@@ y ! ' said she , while with de@@ ft fingers she felt for the remaining pins in her hair .
for an instant her head had dro@@ op@@ ed and the mo@@ cking spark in her eyes had died away , but the word ' love ' aroused her again .
for a moment the sound he emitted seemed to have star@@ tled K@@ aren@@ in , and he stopped ; but , after he had breath@@ ed twice , the whist@@ ling recomm@@ enced with fresh and calm regularity .
for a long time she lay still with wide @@@ -@@ @ open eyes , the brightness of which it seemed to her she could herself see in the darkness .
but in spite of the murderer 's horror of the body of his victim , that body must be cut in pieces and hidden away , and he must make use of what he has obtained by the murder .
now that years have passed , when I remember it , I am surprised that it could have griev@@ ed me so much .
he could not find peace , because he had so long dreamed of family life and felt so ripe for it , but was still un@@ married and further than ever from marriage .
he himself felt painfully what all those around him felt too , that it is not good for a man of his age to be alone .
meanwhile spring had come , a glorious steady spring , without the expectations and dis@@ appointments spring usually brings . it was one of these rare springs which plants , animals , and men alike rejoice in .
Easter found snow still on the ground ; but on Easter Monday a warm wind began to blow , the clouds gathered , and for three days and nights warm stor@@ my rain poured down .
on the Thursday the wind fell and a thick grey mist rose as if to hide the secret of the changes nature was carrying on .
in the morning the bright rising sun quickly melted the thin ice on the water and the warm air all around vibr@@ ated with the vap@@ our given off by the awakening earth .
the cows had been let out there , and , war@@ med by the sunshine , their glossy new coats g@@ listening , they were lowing to be let out into the fields .
he sent for the carp@@ enter , who was under contract to be with the thresh@@ ing @@@ -@@ @ machine , but it turned out that he was men@@ ding the har@@ rows , which should have been men@@ ded the week before L@@ ent .
he found out that the racks which were not wanted in winter had been taken into the farm @@@ -@@ @ horses ' stable , and there had got broken , as they were lightly made , being meant only for the cal@@ ves .
Levin sent for the ste@@ ward , but instead of waiting went at once to look for him himself .
'@@ It 's not a case of such people , but of such a ste@@ ward ! ' said Levin fl@@ aring up .
'@@ Five are making com@@ po@@ te ' ( he meant comp@@ ost ) ' and four are turning the o@@ ats over . they might begin sp@@ routing , Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich . '
'@@ Ign@@ at ! ' he called to the co@@ ach@@ man , who with sle@@ eves rolled up was washing a carriage at the pump , ' sadd@@ le me ... '
'@@ i 'll send right enough , ' said Vasily Fed@@ or@@ ich , the ste@@ ward , desp@@ ond@@ ently . ' but the horses too are getting weak . '
'@@ You won '@@ t be able to cross the bro@@ ok , Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich , ' the co@@ ach@@ man called out .
and Levin rode across the mud@@ dy yard and out of the gate into the field at a b@@ risk am@@ ble , his fresh little horse s@@ nor@@ ting at the p@@ ud@@ dles and pulling at the bri@@ dle .
dreaming such dreams , carefully guiding his horse so as not to tr@@ ample down his young growth , he rode up to the lab@@ our@@ ers who were sowing the clo@@ ver .
when Vasily came up Levin told him to take the cart and horse on to the border .
'@@ But the sowing , Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich , is getting on first @@@ -@@ @ rate , ' he said making up to the master .
'@@ Oh , but we crum@@ ble it up , ' said Vasily , taking a handful and rubbing the earth between his pal@@ ms .
Levin mounted his horse and rode to the field where clo@@ ver had been s@@ own the year before , and to another which was deeply pl@@ ough@@ ed and ready for sowing the spring wheat .
Levin rode on at a tro@@ t , so as to have dinner and get his gun ready for the evening .
as Levin , IN THE highest SP@@ IR@@ ITS , was nearing the house he heard the sound of a tin@@ k@@ ling bell approaching the main entrance .
but he was ashamed of that feeling , and immediately , as it were , opened out his spiritual arms and with tender joy expected , and now hoped with his whole soul , that it was his brother .
'@@ It would have been worse still on wheels , Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich , ' said the driver , whom Levin knew .
Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na , always much concerned about the honour of the house , met him in the hall with questions about dinner .
when he returned , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , fresh and clean , with hair br@@ ushed , and face radiant with smiles , was just coming out of his room , and they went up@@ stairs together .
a pretty house @@@ -@@ @ maid with a little ap@@ ron would be preferable ; but with your severe and mon@@ astic style this one is more suitable . '
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky had much interesting news to tell , and one item of special interest to Levin was that his brother , Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich , intended to come and stay in the country with him that summer .
you know I am quite an out@@ sider in these matters , but I should think this theory and its application ought to influence the lab@@ ou@@ rer too . '
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky went down and himself carefully took the canvas cover off the var@@ nished case , opened it , and set to work to put together his valuable gun , which was of the newest type .
Kuz@@ ma , already s@@ cent@@ ing a substantial tip , did not leave O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky for a moment . he put on his stock@@ ings and his boots for him , and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky willingly allowed him to do so .
he sat down , wrapped a rug round his legs , and lit a ci@@ gar . ' how is it you don '@@ t smoke . ?
I am made that way . and really so little harm is done to anyone , and one gets so much pleasure ... '
when they had reached the wood Levin got down and led O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky to the corner of a mos@@ sy and marsh@@ y gl@@ ade , already free from snow .
the sun was setting behind the forest , and the little bir@@ ches inter@@ s@@ pers@@ ed among the asp@@ en trees stood out clearly against the evening glow with their dro@@ oping branches and their sw@@ ol@@ len bu@@ ds ready to burst into leaf .
from the th@@ icket , where the snow had not all melted , the water still flowed in bran@@ ching stream@@ lets with a gentle rip@@ pling sound .
one can hear and see the grass growing , ' thought Levin , as he noticed a wet s@@ late @@@ -@@ @ coloured asp@@ en leaf move close to the point of a blade of grass .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's figure again disappeared behind the bush , and Levin only saw the fl@@ are of a match , followed by the red glow of a cigarette and a spiral of blue smoke .
Levin looked to the right and to the left , and there before him against the dull light @@@ -@@ @ blue sky , over the lower branches of the asp@@ en tops , appeared the flying birds .
through the young bir@@ ches , Venus bright and sil@@ very , was already shining with her delicate glit@@ ter low down in the west and high up in the east fl@@ ick@@ ered the red fire of the dim Arc@@ tur@@ us .
'@@ Stephen ! ' said Levin suddenly and unexpectedly ' why don '@@ t you tell me whether your sister @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law is married , or when she will be ? '
and no dealer will ever buy without first counting , unless the forest is given to him for nothing , as you are doing .
he was a tall , spare , middle @@@ -@@ @ aged man , with a mou@@ st@@ ache , a prominent sha@@ ven chin , and prominent dim eyes .
he wiped his face all round with his hand@@ ker@@ chief , and smoo@@ thing his coat , which was already quite in order , smil@@ ingly greeted the new arri@@ vals . he held out his hand to O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky as if he were trying to catch something .
on entering the study Ry@@ ab@@ in@@ in looked round by force of habit as though to find the icon , but after finding it he did not cross himself .
'@@ i can do that , ' said Ry@@ ab@@ in@@ in , sitting down and putting his arm on the back of his chair in a most uncomfortable way . ' you must let me off something , Prince .
Levin , who had been putting away his gun in a cu@@ pboard , was just going out of the door , but on hearing the dealer 's words he stopped .
'@@ He is very close , is Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich , ' he said , addressing O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky with a smile . ' it 's absolutely impossible to buy anything of him .
if you have , there 's no use bargaining , but if not , ' said Levin , ' I will buy the forest myself . '
'@@ If you please , the forest is mine , ' he said , rapidly crossing himself and holding out his hand . ' take your money , the forest is mine .
that 's the way Ry@@ ab@@ in@@ in does business , no fus@@ sing about kop@@ eks , ' he said , fro@@ w@@ ning and flourishing his pocket @@@ -@@ @ book .
'@@ If I were you I should not be in a hurry to take it , ' remarked Levin .
why , I am making this purchase , believe me , just for the honour and glory of the thing , so that it should be Ry@@ ab@@ in@@ in and not another that has bought O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's forest .
an hour later the dealer ; with his coat well lap@@ ped over , the hoo@@ ks of his over@@ coat carefully fast@@ ened , and with the agreement in his pocket , seated himself in his little cart and drove home .
" that 's so , " responded the cler@@ k , handing him the re@@ ins and but@@ t@@ oning the leather ap@@ ron . " but I can congratulate you on the purchase , Mi@@ hail Ign@@ ati@@ t@@ ch ? "
the stupid sale of the forest , the sw@@ ind@@ le O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky had fallen a prey to , which had been perpetr@@ ated in his house , irrit@@ ated him .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky wrink@@ led his face good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ure@@ dly , like an innocent man who was being hurt and interfer@@ ed with .
'@@ Oh don '@@ t ! ' he said . ' when has a man ever sold anything without being told immediately after that it was worth much more ?
and impoverished not from extravag@@ ance . that would not matter so much : to spend like a no@@ bl@@ eman is their business - only the no@@ bl@@ esse know how to do it .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky sat down to table and began jo@@ king with Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na , assuring her that it was long since he had had such a dinner and sup@@ per as that day .
there was one question he wanted to put to O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , but could not bring himself to ask , nor could he find the form to put it in or the moment to ask it .
'@@ Yes , by the by , where is V@@ ron@@ sky now ? ' he asked , suddenly putting down the soap .
I want to tell you candi@@ dly that if I were you , I 'd came to Moscow now with me , and ... '
on THE DA@@ Y OF THE Krasno@@ e Sel@@ o RA@@ CES V@@ ron@@ sky came earlier than usual to the regim@@ ental mess @@@ -@@ @ room to eat his be@@ ef@@ ste@@ ak .
he sat waiting with his el@@ b@@ ows on the table and his coat un@@ but@@ t@@ oned over a white wai@@ st@@ coat , and while waiting for the be@@ ef@@ ste@@ ak he had ordered he looked at the pages of a French novel that lay on his plate .
he went to the K@@ aren@@ ins ' country house * as seldom as possible , but now he meant to go there and was considering how to do it .
V@@ ron@@ sky glanced at them , fro@@ w@@ ned , and , as if he had not noticed them , turned his eyes on his book and began to eat and read at the same time .
'@@ Sup@@ pose we have some Rhine wine , ' said the young one , turning his eyes tim@@ idly to V@@ ron@@ sky while his fingers tried to catch hold of his just @@@ -@@ @ bud@@ ding mou@@ st@@ ache .
at that moment Captain Y@@ ash@@ vin , a tall man with a fine figure , entered the room , and having given a cont@@ emp@@ tuous backward nod to the two officers he came up to V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ That is wise , Alex@@ is , ' said the captain in a loud bar@@ it@@ one , ' eat now , and drink one small glass . '
he felt that Y@@ ash@@ vin , though apparently desp@@ ising all emotion , was the only one who could understand the power of the passion that now filled his whole life .
V@@ ron@@ sky did not talk to him of his love , but was aware that he knew all about it and understood it rightly , and it was pleasant to him to read this in Y@@ ash@@ vin 's eyes .
he had really promised to go to Bry@@ ansky 's , who lived seven miles from Pet@@ er@@ hof , and pay him for the horses , and he hoped to make time to call there too .
'@@ W@@ ait ! ' shouted Petr@@ itsky to V@@ ron@@ sky , who was already going out . ' your brother left a letter for you and a note . wait ! where are they ? '
'@@ What business is it of theirs ? ' thought he , and crum@@ pling up the letters he pushed them in between the buttons of his coat , to be read more attentively on the way .
'@@ These are the things to restore me ! ' shouted Petr@@ itsky on seeing the new @@@ -@@ @ com@@ ers . the orderly stood before him with vodka and pick@@ led c@@ uc@@ um@@ bers on a tray . ' Y@@ ash@@ vin here has ordered vodka to fresh@@ en me up . '
'@@ Well , you did give it us last night , ' said one of the new @@@ -@@ @ com@@ ers . ' you did not let us sleep all night . '
'@@ To the st@@ ables ! ' he said , and was taking out the letter to read , but then changed his mind , not wishing to be upset before examining his horse . ' later will do ! ... '
the temporary ST@@ ABLE , a wooden structure , had been built close to the rac@@ ec@@ our@@ se , and it was there his mare was to have been brought the day before .
during these last days he had not exercised her himself , but had entrusted it to the trainer , and therefore did not in the least know in what condition she had arrived or now was .
'@@ Fro@@ u @@@ -@@ @ Fro@@ u is the bra@@ ver , but the other is the more powerful horse , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , smiling at the complim@@ ent to his riding :
the mare is nervous , ' he added , nod@@ ding toward the closed horse@@ box before which they were standing , and from which was heard the tram@@ pling of hoo@@ fs among the straw .
but she possessed in the highest degree a characteristic which made one forget all her defects . this was her thorough@@ bred quality - the kind of blood that tells , as they say in English .
the mare 's excitement had communicated itself to V@@ ron@@ sky . he felt that the blood was rushing to his heart , and that he , like the horse , wished to move and to bite ; it was both frightening and joyful .
'@@ Well then , I rely on you , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky to the Englis@@ hman . ' you will be on the spot at half @@@ -@@ @ past six . '
V@@ ron@@ sky raised his head in amaz@@ ement and looked as he knew how to , not into the Englis@@ hman 's eyes but at his forehead , surprised at the bold@@ ness of the question .
he had not gone many yards before the clouds , which had been threatening since morning , broke , and there was a down@@ pour of rain .
'@@ This is bad ! ' thought V@@ ron@@ sky , raising the hood of the cal@@ è@@ che . ' it was mud@@ dy before , but now it will be a sw@@ amp . '
sitting alone in the closed chal@@ ice he drew out his mother 's letter and his brother 's note and read them through .
she wore a white dress trim@@ med with wide embroi@@ dery , and as she sat in a corner of the ver@@ and@@ ah behind some plants , did not hear V@@ ron@@ sky coming .
b@@ owing her cur@@ ly head she pressed her forehead against a cold wat@@ ering @@@ -@@ @ can that stood on the bal@@ u@@ str@@ ade , and both her beautiful hands , with the rings he knew so well , were holding the can .
he wished to run toward her , but remembering that there might be others near , turned to look at the ver@@ and@@ ah door and bl@@ ushed , as he always did when he felt that he had reason to fear and to be circum@@ spect .
she did not answer , but , slightly b@@ owing her head , looked at him from under her brows question@@ ingly , her eyes shining from under their long l@@ ashes .
better not tell him , - why put him to the proof ? ' she thought , continuing to look at him in the same way and feeling that her hand with the leaf was trembling more and more .
the leaf in her hand shook still more violently , but she did not move her eyes from his face , watching to see how he would take it .
he gave her a look full of emotion , hum@@ bly kis@@ sed her hand , rose , and began silently pac@@ ing up and down the ver@@ and@@ ah .
only after going some five miles did he recoll@@ ect himself sufficiently to look at his watch and to realize that it was already half @@@ -@@ @ past five , and that he was late .
he could be in time for his own race , but , if he called on Bry@@ ansky first he could only just manage it , and the whole Court would already be at the rac@@ ec@@ our@@ se .
when he reached his quarters he found no one there - they had all gone to the races and his val@@ et was waiting at the gate .
while he was changing his things , the val@@ et told him that the second race had already begun and that many gentlemen had been to inqu@@ ire for him , and a l@@ ad had run over twice from the st@@ ables .
having changed without hur@@ rying ( he never hur@@ ried or lost his self @@@ -@@ @ control ) , V@@ ron@@ sky ordered the co@@ ach@@ man to drive him to the st@@ ables .
from there he could see the sea of carriages , pedestrians , and soldiers surrounding the rac@@ ec@@ our@@ se , and the stands , which were thr@@ ong@@ ed with people .
on his way he met Mak@@ ho@@ tin 's white @@@ -@@ @ leg@@ ged ch@@ est@@ nut G@@ lad@@ i@@ ator , which in a blue @@@ -@@ @ bor@@ dered orange covering , with his ears looking enormous in their blue @@@ -@@ @ trim@@ med cloth , was being led to the course .
but he continually met acquaintances who stopped him , told him about the races that had been run , and asked him why he was so late .
'@@ ah , there is K@@ aren@@ in ! ' said the acquaintance with whom he was talking . ' he is looking for his wife , and she is in the centre of the pavilion .
he had not had time to examine the sadd@@ le , about which he wished to give some directions , when the riders were summoned to the pavilion to draw their numbers and places .
cord , in honour of the races , was dressed in his best clothes : a black but@@ t@@ oned @@@ -@@ @ up coat , a stiff star@@ ched collar that pressed against his cheeks , a bow@@ ler hat , and top boots .
Gal@@ tsin , one of the formidable competitors and a friend of V@@ ron@@ sky 's , was struggling with a sor@@ rel g@@ el@@ ding that would not let him mount .
'@@ Don '@@ t hurry , ' said C@@ ord to V@@ ron@@ sky , ' and remember one thing : do not hold back or urge on your horse at an obstacle . let her have her way . '
having got his right foot also in its stir@@ r@@ up he strai@@ ghtened out the double re@@ ins between his practi@@ sed fingers , and C@@ ord removed his hand .
the res@@ tive horse tu@@ gged at the re@@ ins , now to one side , now to the other , trying to deceive her ri@@ der , and V@@ ron@@ sky v@@ ain@@ ly sought by voice and hand to soo@@ the her .
it was to take place on the large four @@@ -@@ @ ver@@ st el@@ lip@@ tical course in front of the pavilion .
three times the riders drew up in line , but each time someone 's horse made a false start and they had to line up again .
it had looked to the public as if they had all started together , but the riders were aware of a difference of seconds which to them were of great importance .
these particul@@ ars V@@ ron@@ sky learned later , now he only saw that Diana 's head or legs might come just where Fro@@ u @@@ -@@ @ Fro@@ u had to ali@@ ght .
but Fro@@ u @@@ -@@ @ Fro@@ u , like a falling cat , made an effort with her legs and back while in the air , and clearing the other horse rushed on .
after crossing the bro@@ ok V@@ ron@@ sky had the mare quite under control , and held her in , inten@@ ding to cross the big barrier behind Mak@@ ho@@ tin and then to try and pass him on the flat 300 yards before the next obstacle .
they ran side by side for a few strides , but before the obstacle they were approaching , V@@ ron@@ sky , not to lose ground , gave the mare her head and just on the dec@@ li@@ vity passed Mak@@ ho@@ tin .
V@@ ron@@ sky did not even look at it , but hoping to win by a distance , began working the re@@ ins with a circular movement , raising and dropping the mare 's head in time with her stri@@ de .
he himself , without knowing it , had made the un@@ par@@ don@@ able mistake of dropping back in his sadd@@ le and pulling up her head .
before he could realize this , the white legs of the g@@ el@@ ding fl@@ ashed close by him and Mak@@ ho@@ tin passed at a rapid gal@@ lo@@ p .
the mare again began to struggle like a fish , causing the fl@@ aps of the sadd@@ le to cre@@ ak ; she got her front legs free , but unable to lift her h@@ ind @@@ -@@ @ quarters , struggled and immediately again fell on her side .
he turned away and , without picking up the cap that had fallen from his head , left the rac@@ ec@@ our@@ se without knowing where he was going .
for the first time in his life he experienced the worst kind of mis@@ fortune - one that was ir@@ retri@@ ev@@ able , and caused by his own fault .
he who had been a consider@@ ate father , since the end of that winter had become particularly cold toward his son , and treated him in the same ban@@ tering manner as he did his wife .
that was why K@@ aren@@ in 's face bore a stern , proud expression when anyone asked about his wife 's health .
once he d@@ ined there , and the other time he spent an evening with some visitors , but he had not once stayed the night , as he used to do in former years .
on the previous day the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna had sent him a pam@@ ph@@ let by a celebrated traveller in China , and a letter asking him to receive this traveller , who for various reasons was very interesting and necessary to them .
at the same time as the traveller , a provincial Mar@@ sh@@ al of the Nob@@ ility was announced with whom K@@ aren@@ in had some things to talk over .
when he too had left , he had to finish his everyday business with his private secretary and had also to drive to see an important person@@ age on a grave and serious matter .
he only managed to get back at five , his dinner @@@ -@@ @ time , and having d@@ ined with his private secretary , he invited the latter to drive with him to his country house and to go to the races with him .
'@@ It is too early for Bet@@ sy , ' she thought , and gl@@ ancing out of the window she saw the carriage , and sticking out of it a black hat and K@@ aren@@ in 's familiar ears . ' how unfortunate !
'@@ i am going , good @@@ -@@ @ bye ! ' said Anna , and giving her son a kiss she went up to K@@ aren@@ in and held out her hand to him . ' you were very kind to come . '
two men - her husband and her lover - were the two centres of her life , and without the aid of her senses she was aware of the presence of either .
she was tor@@ m@@ ented by anxiety for V@@ ron@@ sky , but suffered even more from what seemed to her the incess@@ ant flow of her husband 's shr@@ ill voice with its familiar int@@ on@@ ations .
and as it is natural for the child to skip about , so it was natural for him to speak cl@@ ever@@ ly and well .
'@@ the danger in military , that is , cav@@ alry , ste@@ epl@@ ech@@ ases is an unavoidable element of the racing .
'@@ It is exciting , but one C@@ AN@@ NOT tear oneself away , ' said another lady . ' if I had been a Roman , I should never have missed a gl@@ adi@@ atorial show . '
and though the answer did not mean anything , the general made as though he had heard a clever reply from a clever man , and quite appreciated la Po@@ in@@ te de la sauce . '
'@@ There are two sides to it , ' continued K@@ aren@@ in , ' that of the performers and that of the spectators . the love of such spectac@@ les is the su@@ rest proof of low development in the on@@ loo@@ kers , I admit , but ... '
K@@ aren@@ in was not interested in races and therefore did not watch the riders , but began absent @@@ -@@ @ min@@ dedly looking at the spectators with his weary eyes .
by the end of the race every one was disturbed , and this disturbance was increased by the fact that the Emperor was dis@@ pleased .
she put down her glasses and was about to go ; but at that moment an officer gal@@ lo@@ ped up and reported something to the Emperor .
'@@ no , Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich , ' she put in , ' I brought Anna here and I have promised to take her back again . '
'@@ Don '@@ t forget , ' said he to her , pointing at the open window behind the co@@ ach@@ man 's box ; and , slightly rising , he lifted the window .
now that a complete disclosure was impending , he expected nothing so much as that she would , as before , answer him mock@@ ingly that his suspicions were ridiculous and ground@@ less .
as they were driving up to it , he turned his face to her still with the same expression and said :
in the presence of the servants he pressed her hand , re @@@ -@@ @ entered the carriage , and drove off toward Petersburg .
when all this had become firmly established , Kit@@ ty began to feel very dull , especially as her father had gone to Car@@ ls@@ bad and she was left alone with her mother .
among these people she was specially interested in a young Russian girl who had come to the wat@@ ering @@@ -@@ @ place with an invalid Russian lady , Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l , as every one called her .
Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l belonged to the highest Society , but she was so ill that she could not walk , and only on fine days occasionally appeared on the pro@@ men@@ ade in a bath @@@ -@@ @ chair .
soon after the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys ' arrival , two new persons who provoked everybody 's dis@@ approval began to appear of a morning at the W@@ ells .
but the Princess , having found out from the visitors ' list that they were Nicholas Levin and Mary Ivan@@ ovna , explained to Kit@@ ty what a bad man this Levin was , and all her dreams about those two people vanished .
this Levin , by his habit of jer@@ king his head , now inspired an irre@@ pres@@ sible feeling of aver@@ sion in her .
it W@@ AS A dull DA@@ Y , it rained the whole morning , and the patients with their umbrel@@ las crowded the covered gallery .
Kit@@ ty was walking with her mother and the Moscow Colonel , who sw@@ agg@@ ered g@@ aily in his short , German coat , bought ready @@@ -@@ @ made in Frank@@ fort .
'@@ Well , if you want to so much , I will inqu@@ ire about her first and will speak to her myself , ' answered her mother . ' what do you see particular in her ?
that tall gentleman has been quar@@ rel@@ ling with the doctor and insul@@ ting him , because he is dissatisfied with the doctor 's treatment . he shook his stick at him !
'@@ Luc@@ kily that ... you know the girl with a hat like a mush@@ room - she 's Russian , I think - intervened , ' said the Colonel .
choosing a moment when her daughter had gone to the Well and V@@ aren@@ ka had stopped in front of a b@@ aker 's shop , the Princess went up to her .
'@@ Well , you see , his companion called me , and I tried to soo@@ the him ; he is very ill and was dissatisfied with his doctor .
Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l , of whom some people said that she had tor@@ m@@ ented her husband to death , while others said that , by his immoral conduct , he had tor@@ m@@ ented her , had always been a sick@@ ly and ec@@ static woman .
'@@ See , ' said the Colonel , looking out of the window , ' what an audience has assembled to hear you . ' underneath the window a considerable crowd really had collected .
the Princess asked V@@ aren@@ ka to sing again , and she sang another song just as truly , clearly , and well , standing straight at the piano , and beating time on it with her thin brown hand .
you did not think that I too have had a romance ? ' she said , and on her handsome face there fl@@ ick@@ ered for an instant a spark of the fire which , Kit@@ ty felt , had once lighted up her whole being .
and once , when Kit@@ ty met a Roman Catholic priest at the house , she observed that Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l carefully hid her face behind the lam@@ p@@ shade and smiled in a peculiar manner .
in V@@ aren@@ ka she saw that it was only necessary to forget oneself and to love others in order to be at peace , happy , and lovely .
'@@ Well , go if you like , ' said the Princess , looking int@@ ently into her daughter 's confused face and trying to guess the cause of her confusion .
it was one of those things which one knows and yet C@@ AN@@ NOT say even to oneself - so dreadful and shameful would it be to make a mistake .
she remembered her first efforts to conquer the re@@ pulsion she felt for him , as for all consu@@ mp@@ tives , and her efforts to find something to say to him .
she remembered the tim@@ id look , full of emotion , with which he gaz@@ ed at her , and the strange feeling of compassion and awk@@ wardness followed by a consciousness of her own ben@@ evol@@ ence , that she had experienced .
quite TO@@ W@@ ARD THE EN@@ D OF THE SE@@ AS@@ ON Prince Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky , who from Car@@ ls@@ bad had gone on to Baden and Kis@@ sing@@ en to see some Russian friends and to ' in@@ hale some Russian spirit , ' as he expressed it , returned to his family .
but these unpleasant rumours were soon drowned in that sea of kind @@@ -@@ @ hearted cheer@@ fulness which was always within him and which was increased by the Car@@ ls@@ bad water .
'@@ Intro@@ duce me , introduce me to your new friends , ' he said to his daughter , pressing her arm with his el@@ bow . ' I have even taken a liking to your nasty So@@ den because it has done you so much good .
just at the entrance to the gardens they met the blind Mad@@ ame Ber@@ the with her guide , and the Prince was pleased by the tender look on the old French@@ woman 's face when she heard Kit@@ ty 's voice .
'@@ of course I know you , I 've heard all about you , ' the Prince said to her with a smile , by which Kit@@ ty saw with joy that her father liked V@@ aren@@ ka . ' where are you hur@@ rying so to ? '
the man raised his straw hat above his thin cur@@ ly hair , un@@ covering a tall forehead with an unhealthy redness where the hat had pressed it .
'@@ How is it you sent word to the Princess that we were not going ? ' he said in an irrit@@ able whis@@ per , his voice failing him .
behind her was a sul@@ len @@@ -@@ @ looking , robust German work@@ man who pushed her bath @@@ -@@ @ chair .
'@@ ah ! ' exclaimed the Prince , seeing the Moscow Colonel standing near by , and with a bow to Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l he moved away with his daughter and with the Moscow Colonel , who had joined them .
there remained only a short @@@ -@@ @ leg@@ ged woman who was always lying down because she had a bad figure , and who tor@@ m@@ ented poor un@@ resisting V@@ aren@@ ka for not t@@ uc@@ king her pl@@ aid the right way .
they knew his generosity , and in a quarter of an hour the sick Hamburg doctor , who lived up@@ stairs , was looking with envy from his window at the mer@@ ry party of healthy Russians gathered under the ch@@ est@@ nut tree .
to this problem was added the change in her relations with the Pet@@ rov@@ s , which had been so clearly and un@@ pleas@@ antly demonstrated that morning .
she felt almost as she used to feel when , as a child , she was locked up in a room for punishment and heard her sister 's mer@@ ry laughter .
I have not conquered anybody , but here I have to take off my own boots and even put them outside the door myself .
there are times when one would give a whole month for a sh@@ illing and there are times when you would not give half an hour at any price .
'@@ Oh dear , I have not laughed so much for a long time ! ' said V@@ aren@@ ka , collecting her sun@@ shade and bag . ' what a dear your Pap@@ a is ! '
'@@ There is nothing special to tell , only Pet@@ rov used to want to leave sooner but now does not want to go , ' said V@@ aren@@ ka smiling .
'@@ It serves me right , it serves me right ! ' Kit@@ ty began hur@@ ri@@ edly , s@@ nat@@ ching V@@ aren@@ ka 's sun@@ shade out of her hands , and looking past her friend 's eyes .
'@@ It serves me right because it was all pret@@ ence , all invented and not heart@@ felt .
she was not as ca@@ reless and light @@@ -@@ @ hearted as before , but she was at peace . her old Moscow sor@@ rows were no more than a memory .
according to his views country life was preferable to any other , and he had now come to his brother 's house to enjoy it .
to say that he knew the peasants was tantamount to saying that he knew human beings .
with an elder brother 's con@@ des@@ cension he sometimes explained to him the meaning of things , but could find no pleasure in discussion , because he could gain too easy a victory .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev loved to lie bas@@ king in the sunshine , talking laz@@ ily .
'@@ no ; I must just look in at the counting @@@ -@@ @ house for a moment , ' answered Levin , and off he ran to the fields .
it was the time of that short pause before the labour , yearly renewed , of getting in the harvest , which always demands all the peasants ' strength for its accomplishment .
Levin , on the contrary , was impati@@ ent to get home in order to give orders about hiring the m@@ ow@@ ers on the mor@@ row , and to decide about the ha@@ y harvest , which greatly occupied his mind .
pe@@ ering into the distance across the river , he made out something black in the cor@@ n@@ field , and could not see whether it was only a horse or the ste@@ ward on horse@@ back .
you have made an attempt , and because according to your judgment it was a failure , you gave it up .
Constan@@ tine felt that there was nothing for him but to submit or else to own to a lack of love for the common cause , and he felt wounded and griev@@ ed .
he remained silent a@@ while , lifted his rod and threw the line again , and then turned to his brother with a smile .
the roads are not better and C@@ AN@@ NOT be made better , and my horses do manage to pull me over the bad ones .
I not only do not require schools , but they would even do me harm , as I have already told you .
'@@ Come , ' smil@@ ingly interrupted Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , ' it was not our personal interest which induced us to work for the emancip@@ ation of the ser@@ fs , and yet we did it . '
'@@ He too has some philosophy or other to serve his in@@ clin@@ ations , ' he thought
the bir@@ ches are not stuck in : some of them are planted , and others are s@@ own and have to be tended carefully .
but while walking over the me@@ adow he recalled the impression m@@ owing had made on him , and almost made up his mind to do it .
'@@ It 's ready , master ! like a ra@@ zor , it will mo@@ w of itself , ' said Tit@@ us , taking off his cap and smiling as he handed the sc@@ y@@ the .
the peasants , per@@ spir@@ ing and mer@@ ry , who had finished their sw@@ aths came out on to the road one after another , and laugh@@ ingly exchanged greetings with the master .
'@@ Mind , master ! having put your hand to the pl@@ ough , don '@@ t look back ! ' and Levin heard the sound of repressed laughter among the m@@ ow@@ ers .
'@@ i will try not to lag behind , ' he said , taking his place behind Tit@@ us and waiting his turn to fall in .
when they had gone some hundred steps Tit@@ us was still going on without pa@@ using , showing no signs of fatigue , while Levin was already beginning to fear he would not be able to keep up , he felt so tired .
what gave him most pleasure was the knowledge that he would be able to keep up with the peasants .
some of the peasants went to put on their coats ; others as well as Levin felt pleasure in the refreshing rain and merely moved their shoulders up and down .
only then he remembered that he had not been right about the weather and that the rain was wet@@ ting the ha@@ y .
his pleasant young face , with a wis@@ p of grass tied round the forehead over his hair , worked all over with the effort ; but whenever anyone glanced at him he smiled .
and really Levin thought he had never t@@ asted any nic@@ er drink than this lu@@ ke@@ warm water with green stuff floating in it and a flav@@ our of the ru@@ sty tin box .
all the m@@ ow@@ ers on reaching the river went across the sw@@ aths to where their coats lay , and where the children who had brought their dinners sat waiting for them .
some had a wash . the young lad@@ s bath@@ ed in the river ; others arranged places for their after @@@ -@@ @ dinner rest , un@@ fast@@ ened their bags of bread and un@@ stop@@ pered their ju@@ gs of k@@ vas .
the old man had already been long awake and sat setting the sc@@ y@@ thes for the young men .
a wide expan@@ se of the me@@ adow was already m@@ own , and with its sw@@ aths of grass already giving off perf@@ ume , shone with a peculiar fresh brilli@@ ance in the obli@@ que rays of the descending sun .
'@@ What do you think - could we manage to get Mash@@ kin Heights m@@ own to @@@ -@@ @ day ? ' he asked the old man .
the sun was already setting toward the trees when , with their tin boxes ratt@@ ling , they entered the woo@@ ded rav@@ ine of the Heights .
after a short consultation as to whether they should mo@@ w the rav@@ ine across or leng@@ th@@ wise , Pro@@ kh@@ or - a gigantic dark man and a famous m@@ ower - took the lead .
on the short sw@@ aths the m@@ ow@@ ers crowded together , their tin boxes cl@@ attering , their sc@@ y@@ thes ringing whenever they touched , the wh@@ et@@ stones whist@@ ling upon the blades , and their mer@@ ry voices res@@ ounding as they urged each other on .
the old man , who had put on his she@@ ep@@ skin jacket , was still as j@@ ol@@ ly , wit@@ ty , and easy in his movements as before .
the old man sto@@ op@@ ed each time he came upon one , picked it up , and put it inside his jacket , saying , ' Another treat for my old woman . '
it was easy to cut the wet soft grass , but on the other hand it was very difficult to go up and down the steep slopes of the rav@@ ine .
you know , I thought of coming to the me@@ adow to have a look at you , but it was so un@@ bear@@ ably hot that I got only as far as the forest !
'@@ P@@ ossi@@ bly ; but it is a pleasure such as I have never in my life experienced before , and there is nothing wrong in it .
in the spring , when O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky went there to sell the forest , Dol@@ ly had asked him to look over the house and have all necessary repairs done .
when he returned to Moscow he informed his wife that all was being prepared , that the house would look like a new toy , and advised her to move thi@@ ther .
the day after her arrival it poured with rain and in the night the rain came through into the passage and nur@@ sery , so that the children 's beds had to be carried into the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room .
there was nowhere to hang dresses , because what few wardro@@ bes there were would not shut , or else opened of themselves when anyone passed by .
she at once made friends with the ste@@ ward 's wife , and on the very day of the removal drank tea with her and with the ste@@ ward beneath the lab@@ ur@@ num@@ s , discussing arrangements .
at THE EN@@ D OF MA@@ Y , when the house was more or less in order , Dol@@ ly received from her husband an answer to her letter of complaint .
one of the fro@@ cks , which the English govern@@ ess had undertaken to alter , was the cause of much bad blood .
the govern@@ ess put the bod@@ ice dar@@ ts in the wrong places , cut out the arm @@@ -@@ @ holes too big , and nearly spo@@ ilt the dress .
she was not dressing for her own sake , not for her own beauty , but in order , as the mother of all those charming children , not to spoil the general effect .
little L@@ ily was charming in her naive wonder at everything around , and it was difficult to re@@ press a smile when , having swallowed the bread and wine , she said in English , ' More , please ! '
on the ple@@ a of giving her dolls some dinner she had obtained leave from the govern@@ ess to take her plat@@ eful of p@@ ud@@ ding to the nur@@ sery , but had brought it to her brother instead .
previously Miss H@@ ull used to find one and point it out to her ; but this time L@@ ily herself found a fine big one and there was a general shout of delight : ' L@@ ily has found a mush@@ room ! '
when half the children were dressed again , some smar@@ tly @@@ -@@ @ dressed peasant women who had been gathering herbs came up and halted sh@@ y@@ ly by the bathing @@@ -@@ @ house .
Mat@@ ren@@ a Fil@@ im@@ on@@ ovna called to one of these to ask her to dry a bath @@@ -@@ @ sheet and a chem@@ ise that had fallen into the water , and Dol@@ ly entered into conversation with them .
the peasant women , who had begun by laughing behind their hands without compreh@@ ending her questions , soon became b@@ older and more tal@@ k@@ ative , and at once cap@@ tiv@@ ated Dol@@ ly by their frank admiration of her children .
'@@ Just look at the little beauty , as white as sugar ! ' said one , gaz@@ ing admir@@ ingly at T@@ anya and stro@@ king her head . ' but she 's thin . '
and the conversation turned upon the topic that interested Dol@@ ly more than any other : confin@@ ements , children 's illnesses , husbands ' whereabouts , and whether they came home often .
the women am@@ used her and offended the English govern@@ ess , who noticed that she was the object of their laughter , which she did not understand .
she was always glad to see him , but on this day was more pleased than ever because he would now see her in all her glory .
'@@ of course I understood that this only meant you wanted to see me , and was very pleased .
I can well imagine how strange everything here must seem to you , used as you are to managing a town house ; and if you require anything I am quite at your disposal . '
she knew him , knew that he would be a good match for the young lady , and hoped the affair would come off .
'@@ Don '@@ t be afraid ! Don '@@ t be afraid , Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na ! there 's no fear of my hurting or dropping her , ' said he , smiling brightly at the mother .
and as she looked at his easy , strong , consider@@ ate , careful and ultra @@@ -@@ @ cautious movements , the mother lost her fears and looked at them with a smile of approval .
'@@ in that , at any rate , you are mistaken ; I did not know it , though I had my suspicions . '
'@@ no , wait a bit , ' she answered , holding him by the sleeve . ' wait a bit . sit down . '
'@@ Please , please don '@@ t let us talk about it ! ' said he , sitting down again , conscious as he did so that a hope which he had thought dead and buried was waking and stirring within him .
'@@ Yes , now I understand it all , ' continued Dol@@ ly . ' you can '@@ t understand it , you men who are free and have the choice .
she is expected to choose for herself , yet she has no choice ; she can only say " Yes " or " No . " -@@ '
'@@ Yes , a choice between me and V@@ ron@@ sky , ' thought Levin , and the dead hope that had begun to revive in his soul died again and only weighed painfully on his heart .
the local men opposed this innovation by all the means in their power , but the plan succeeded , and in the first year the meadows brought in almost double .
'@@ Make ha@@ y while the sun shines , and you 'll have plenty , ' remarked the old be@@ e@@ keeper , sitting down beside Levin . ' it 's more like tea than ha@@ y !
the sounds of night - the ceas@@ eless cro@@ aking of fro@@ gs , the s@@ nor@@ ting of horses through the morning mist over the me@@ adow - could alone be heard .
aw@@ aking to reality Levin rose from his ha@@ y@@ cock , and gl@@ ancing up at the stars realized that the night was nearly over .
the first was how to renounce his old life and discard his quite useless education .
the horses were pressing close together away from the ru@@ ts , but the sk@@ il@@ ful driver , sitting side@@ ways on the box , guided them so that the coach wheels ran smoothly in the ru@@ ts .
in one corner an elderly woman was do@@ zing ; and close to the window sat a young girl who had just w@@ ak@@ ened and was holding the rib@@ bons of her white night@@ cap with both hands .
in the whole world there was only one being able to unite in itself the universe and the meaning of life for him .
all that had so disturbed Levin during the sle@@ e@@ pless night and all his resolutions vanished suddenly .
there alone , inside that coach on the other side of the road , so rapidly rec@@ eding from him , was the one possible solution of that rid@@ dle which had been weighing on him so painfully of late .
his wife 's words , confirming as they did his worst suspicions , had given K@@ aren@@ in a cruel pain in his heart .
what K@@ aren@@ in experienced was a feeling of this kind : it had been a strange and terrible pain , but it was past , and he felt he could again live , and think of other things beside his wife .
in his youth K@@ aren@@ in had been particularly attracted by the idea of du@@ elling , just because he was physically a tim@@ id man and was quite aware of it .
this would happen : I , knowing beforehand that matters would never be allowed to reach a dangerous point , should have challenged a man in order to cover myself with false glam@@ our .
having considered and rejected the idea of a du@@ el , K@@ aren@@ in turned his thoughts to divorce , the next expedient of which some of the wrong@@ ed husbands he remembered had avail@@ ed themselves .
K@@ aren@@ in saw that in his own case it would be impossible to obtain a legal divorce - that is , a divorce in which the guilty wife would be simply cast off .
to attempt a divorce could only lead to a lawsuit and a scandal which would give his enemies great opportunity for cal@@ um@@ ny , and would lower his high position in Society .
he did not acknowledge it to himself , but in the depths of his soul he wished her to suffer for im@@ pairing his peace of mind and his honour .
on entering the hall of his house he glanced at the letters and papers which had been sent from the Ministry and ordered them to be brought into his study .
with his el@@ bow on the table and his head bent to one side he sat and thought for a minute , and then wrote without an instant 's pause .
my decision is as follows : whatever your actions may have been , I do not consider myself justified in sever@@ ing the bonds with which a Higher Power has united us .
as the summer season is drawing to a close , I would ask you to return to Petersburg as soon as possible , and not later than Tuesday .
he read the letter over and was satisfied with it , especially with having remembered to enc@@ lose the money ; there was not a single cruel word or threat in it , yet it was not yielding in tone .
as soon as the foot@@ man , who had brought in the tea , had left the room , K@@ aren@@ in rose and went to the writing @@@ -@@ @ table .
the case of the subject races had been accidentally raised at the Committee of 2nd June and had been energe@@ tically insisted on by K@@ aren@@ in , as a matter of urgency in view of their w@@ ret@@ ched condition .
on her way back from the races , in a moment of excitement in spite of the pain it caused her - she had told her husband everything , and she was glad she had done so .
after he left her , she told herself that she was glad she had told him , that now everything would be definite - at any rate , the false@@ hood and deception would no longer exist .
when she thought about V@@ ron@@ sky , she imagined that he did not love her , that he was beginning to find her a burden , and that she could not offer herself to him ; and in consequence she felt hostile toward him .
the note was from Bet@@ sy , who reminded her that she ( Bet@@ sy ) was that day expecting Lisa Mer@@ kal@@ ova and the Bar@@ on@@ ess Stol@@ z , with their admir@@ ers Kalu@@ zh@@ sky and old St@@ remo@@ v , to a game of cro@@ quet .
Anna read the note and sigh@@ ed deeply . ' I don '@@ t want anything , anything at all , ' she said to Ann@@ ush@@ ka , who was moving the bottles and br@@ ushes on the dressing table .
'@@ Ser@@ ez@@ ha , ' she said as soon as the govern@@ ess had gone away , ' it was wrong , but you won '@@ t do it again ? ... You love me ? '
'@@ Go to Mari@@ ette , ' she said to Ser@@ ez@@ ha , who had come out after her , and she began pac@@ ing up and down the straw mat@@ ting of the ver@@ and@@ ah .
'@@ no , no , I must not think , ' she said to herself ; ' I must get ready to go .
'@@ i have informed my husband , ' she began , and was unable to write any more .
in ALL THE RO@@ O@@ MS of the country house porters , gar@@ den@@ ers , and foot@@ men went about carrying out the things .
cu@@ p@@ boards and ch@@ ests of draw@@ ers stood open , twice the nearest shop had been sent to for balls of string . the floor was stre@@ wn with newspapers .
'@@ Go and see what it is , ' she said , and , calmly prepared for anything , sat down in an easy @@@ -@@ @ chair and folded her hands on her knees .
no , I shall break it off , break it off ! ' she exclaimed , jumping up and forcing back her tears .
these considerations had made Anna reluctant to come , and it was to her refusal that the hints in Princess T@@ ver@@ skaya 's note had referred .
she felt inclined to ask where his master was ; she wanted to go home and write to him to come to her house , or to go to him herself . but none of these things could be done .
Bet@@ sy burst into an unexpected , mer@@ ry and un@@ controllable Pe@@ al of laughter , a thing she rarely did .
'@@ It is all very well for you to laugh , ' said Anna , who could not help laughing too , ' but I never was able to understand it .
'@@ You see , ' she said , ' I am in a lucky position ! I understand you and I understand Lisa .
now perhaps she is purpos@@ ely ingen@@ uous , ' and Bet@@ sy smiled poin@@ tedly . ' but still it becomes her .
she entered with a short , b@@ risk step , in shoes with high French heels and shook hands with the ladies with a firm grip like a man .
'@@ It may be that those who are not in our set are still more bored , but we - I at any rate - do not feel mer@@ ry , but terribly , terribly bored . '
'@@ the contrast will be too great , ' he remarked , ' if you go to see the old Countess V@@ re@@ de after leaving this company here .
when Petr@@ itsky - who knew that on such occasions V@@ ron@@ sky was often cross - on waking saw his friend at his writing @@@ -@@ @ table , he dressed quietly and went out without disturbing him .
eight thousand roubles under the second heading were less important : they were owing chiefly for the use of the rac@@ ec@@ our@@ se st@@ ables , to the o@@ ats and ha@@ y @@@ -@@ @ dealer , to the Englis@@ hman , to the Sadd@@ ler and others .
his mother 's wish to bribe him offended him to the bottom of his soul and increased his col@@ dness toward her .
he had made this proposal , but now , thinking it over , he saw clearly that it would be better to avoid that plan , and yet , while he told himself so , he feared that this might be wrong .
after returning to the table , the Commander again came forward with a glass of champagne in his hand and announced a to@@ ast : ' to the health of our late com@@ rade , the gall@@ ant General , Prince Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy !
he jer@@ ked his head backwards and raised his glass , welcoming V@@ ron@@ sky and showing by this gesture that he must first go to the ser@@ ge@@ ant @@@ -@@ @ major , who was already stretching himself and p@@ uck@@ ering his lips for a kiss .
Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy kis@@ sed the smart @@@ -@@ @ looking ser@@ ge@@ ant @@@ -@@ @ major on his mo@@ ist fresh lips and , wi@@ ping his mouth on his hand@@ ker@@ chief , stepped up to V@@ ron@@ sky .
after that , feeling rather weak , he sat down on a bench in the yard and began demonstrating to Y@@ ash@@ vin Russia 's superiority to Prussia , especially in cav@@ alry charges , and the car@@ ous@@ al qui@@ eted down for a moment .
V@@ ron@@ sky had taken off his coat and was washing his hair@@ y red neck under the wash@@ stand tap , rubbing it and his head with his hands .
'@@ i do not think so , ' and Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy smiled again . ' I do not mean to say I could not live without it , but it would be a bore .
I used to think the same , yet here I am living and find that it is not worth while living for that alone , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky .
how am I to put to you what I think ? ' and Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy , who was fond of simil@@ es , went on : ' wait a bit ! wait a bit ! ...
yes , if you had to carry a load and use your hands at the same time , it would be possible only if the load were str@@ apped on your back : and that is marriage .
it gave him pleasure to feel the slight pain in his strong leg , to be conscious of the muscles of his chest moving as he breath@@ ed .
before reaching the avenue he ordered the co@@ ach@@ man to stop , opened the carriage door , jumped out while the carriage was still moving , and went up the avenue leading to the house .
if at this news he would firmly , passi@@ on@@ ately , and without a moment 's hesitation say to her : ' give up everything and fly with me ! ' she would abandon her son and go with him .
'@@ It was not at all hard for me - it all came about of itself , ' she said , irrit@@ ably . ' and here ... ' she pulled her husband 's note from under her g@@ love .
I hope ... ' he became confused and bl@@ ushed ' that you will allow me to arrange and to think out a life for ourselves . to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row ... '
he also felt something rising in his throat , and for the first time in his life he felt ready to cry .
she silently shook her head . ' would it not be possible to take your son away with you and go away all the same ? '
Anna 's carriage , which she had sent away and ordered to return to the gate of the V@@ re@@ de Garden , drove up .
he remembered them all and did not even consider it necessary to go over in his mind what he was going to say .
there was silence for some time . ' is Ser@@ ez@@ ha well ? ' he asked ; and without waiting for a reply he added , ' I am not dining at home to @@@ -@@ @ day and must be going at once . '
why did Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na tell me this ? I might have met her accidentally and then all would have come naturally , but now it is impossible ! '
but now he was glad to go away from the proximity of Kit@@ ty and from his farm , and especially to go shooting , an occupation which served him as the best sol@@ ace in all his troubles .
the dog that followed Levin frightened her , but when she was told that it would not hurt her she at once began to laugh at her own alarm .
in the midst of his conversation about his acquain@@ t@@ anc@@ eship with S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky the gates cre@@ aked again , and the lab@@ our@@ ers returning from the fields came into the yard with their Pl@@ ough@@ s and har@@ rows .
'@@ There in the passage , ' answered the old man , winding the re@@ ins into a ring and throwing them on the ground . ' fix them on before we finish dinner . '
'@@ Why , I don '@@ t know ! we have had tea once to @@@ -@@ @ day , ' said he , evidently pleased to accept the invitation . ' well , just for company ! '
ten years previously he had rented about four hundred acres from the land@@ owner , and the year before he had bought them outright and rented another nine hundred from a neighbouring propri@@ et@@ or .
a small part of the land - the worst - he let , and with the aid of his family and two hired men cultivated about a hundred and twenty acres .
the vigorous young son with his mouth full of buck@@ wheat por@@ ridge was saying something funny , and everybody laughed hear@@ tily - the woman with the gol@@ os@@ hes laughing more mer@@ r@@ ily than anyone as she ref@@ illed the bowl with cab@@ bage soup .
now , after his dis@@ illusion with the work on his estate , Levin was especially pleased to stay a while with S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky .
Levin sat beside the host@@ ess at the tea table , and was obliged to con@@ verse with her and her sister , who was sitting opposite him .
this land@@ owner with the grey mou@@ st@@ ache was evidently an inv@@ eter@@ ate believer in ser@@ f@@ dom , and a passionate farmer who had lived long in the country .
'@@ But we see you don '@@ t give it up , ' said Nicholas Ivan@@ ich S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky , ' so it seems it has its advantages . '
they are starving , yet if you hire one of them as a lab@@ ou@@ rer , he 'll spoil and break things , and will even lodge complaints with the magistr@@ ate . '
Levin , who had long been acquainted with these patri@@ arch@@ al methods , exchanged a glance with S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky , and , interrup@@ ting Michael Pet@@ rovich , addressed the land@@ owner with the grey mou@@ st@@ ache .
'@@ Why , carry on the way Michael Pet@@ rovich does : either pay the peasants in kind , or rent it to them ! that is quite possible , but the wealth of the community as a whole is ruined by such methods .
where my land used to yield nin@@ ef@@ old under ser@@ f@@ dom with good management , it only now yields thre@@ ef@@ old when the lab@@ our@@ ers are paid in kind .
S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky looked at Levin with smiling eyes , and even made a just percep@@ tible sar@@ cas@@ tic sign to him ridicul@@ ing the old man , but Levin did not consider the land@@ owner 's words ridiculous , he understood him better than he did S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky .
'@@ the fact that our agriculture is sinking , that it is impossible , our relation to the peasants being what it is , to carry on our rational farming prof@@ itably , is quite true . '
'@@ Italian book@@ keeping ! ' said the land@@ owner scor@@ n@@ fully . ' keep your accounts as you will - if they spoil everything you have got , you won '@@ t have a profit ! '
'@@ Yes , that is quite true , ' said the land@@ owner with the grey mou@@ st@@ ache , and he even laughed with pleasure .
'@@ And I am not the only one , ' continued Levin . ' I can refer you to many farmers who carry on rational farming , and with rare exceptions they all make a loss on it .
the land@@ owner smiled when the profits of S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky 's farming were mentioned , evidently aware of the sort of profits that his neighbour the Mar@@ sh@@ al of the Nob@@ ility was able to make .
'@@ This year the r@@ asp@@ berries are lasting an extraordinarily long time , ' and S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky got up cheer@@ fully and moved away , evidently regarding the conversation as finished at the very point where to Levin it seemed to be just beginning .
then there is a whole gigantic literature on the labour question , with the most Liberal L@@ ass@@ al@@ le tendency ...
I am , of course , not a professor of Soci@@ ology , but it interests me , and really if it interests you , you had better study the matter . '
'@@ What is it you are looking at ? ' he asked Levin , who , having stopped at the round table , was looking at one of the journals .
it was interesting that ' it turns out , ' and he did not consider it necessary to explain why it interested him .
'@@ Yes , and I was greatly interested by that cross old land@@ owner , ' said Levin with a sigh . ' he is intelligent and said much that is true . '
and in what way knowing how to add and sub@@ tract and to say the cat@@ ech@@ ism will help them to improve their material condition , I never could understand !
she replied that she had been to see the " wise woman " because her boy was fr@@ acti@@ ous , and she took him to be cured .
'@@ Oh , not at all ! ' said Levin , cros@@ sly . ' that treatment seems to me just a parallel to treating the peasants by means of schools .
not one of the talks he had had with S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky , though much that was clever had been said by the latter , interested him , but the land@@ owner 's arguments required consideration .
let us consider the lab@@ ou@@ rer not as an abstract labour force but as a Russian peasant with his own instincts , and let us arrange our farming accordingly .
one of the chief difficulties was that the farming was actually going on and it was impossible to stop it all and start af@@ resh ; so that the machine had to be altered while it was working .
it was true that Theodore Re@@ z@@ un@@ w 's group did not pl@@ ough the corn land twice with the English pl@@ ough as they had agreed to do , ple@@ ading lack of time .
these affairs added to the rest of the farming which remained on his hands , and the indoor work on his book , so filled Levin 's whole summer that he hardly ever made time to go out shooting .
he had treated the S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sk@@ ys just as badly , having left their house without saying good @@@ -@@ @ bye .
often , just as he was beginning to understand the idea in his interloc@@ utor 's mind and to explain his own , he would suddenly be asked : and what about K@@ au@@ ff@@ mann and Jones , and Du@@ bo@@ is and Michel@@ li ? '
but rain set in , making it impossible to get in what remained of the corn and potatoes , stopped all the work , and even prevented the delivery of the wheat .
the mud made the roads im@@ pass@@ able : two mills had been carried away by floods , and the weather was getting worse and worse .
on the thir@@ ti@@ eth of September the sun showed itself in the morning , and , in hopes of fine weather , Levin began seriously preparing for his departure .
his conversation with the peasants of the out@@ lying village showed that they were beginning to get used to the new conditions .
an old inn @@@ -@@ @ keeper , into whose house he had gone to dry himself , evidently approved of Levin 's plan and had offered to join a group to buy cattle .
the whole system of farming , and above all the position of the people , must be completely altered : instead of poverty - wealth and satisfaction for all ; instead of hostility - con@@ cord and a bond of common interest .
having d@@ ined , Levin as usual sat down in his easy @@@ -@@ @ chair with a book , and while reading continued to think about his impending journey in connection with the book he was writing .
to @@@ -@@ @ day the importance of his work presented itself to him with especi@@ al clear@@ ness , and whole paragraphs of their own accord shaped themselves in his mind , expressing the g@@ ist of his thoughts .
he rose to go to his writing @@@ -@@ @ table , and L@@ aska , who was lying at his feet , stretched herself , also got up , and looked round at him as if asking where she was to go to .
but he had no time to write his thoughts down , for the lab@@ our@@ ers ' fo@@ remen had come , and Levin went into the hall to speak to them .
L@@ aska lay down under the table , and Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na with her knit@@ ting sat down in her usual place .
if he has a conscience he will work , if not , you can do nothing with him . '
but Levin over@@ took her . his work was not getting on now and he was glad of a visitor , whoever it might be .
under the sway of the thoughts that had come to him and of Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na 's reminders , he was in an un@@ settled and confused state of mind and the forthcoming meeting with his brother seemed particularly dist@@ ressing .
he was still more terrified when , kis@@ sing his brother 's face , his lips felt the dr@@ y@@ ness of the skin and he saw his large strangely brilliant eyes close at hand .
in spite of the fact that he was more round @@@ -@@ @ shoul@@ dered than ever and that , being so tall , his lean@@ ness was startling , his movements were quick and sudden as formerly .
but neither of them dared speak of it , and not having expressed the one thing that occupied their thoughts , whatever they said rang false .
and that Death which was present in this dear brother ( who , waking up , mo@@ an@@ ed and by habit called in@@ discrimin@@ ately on God and on the devil ) was not so far away as it had hitherto seemed to be .
but what that inevitable Death was , he not only did not know , not only had never considered , but could not and dared not consider .
he lit a candle , got up carefully , went to the looking @@@ -@@ @ glass , and began examining his face and hair .
Levin H@@ AD LO@@ NG AG@@ O noticed that after people have made one uncomfortable by their pli@@ ancy and sub@@ mis@@ siveness they soon become un@@ bear@@ ably exac@@ ting and aggressive .
on the third day of his stay Nicholas challenged his brother to explain his plans to him once more , and not only found fault with them but purpos@@ ely confused them with communism .
'@@ But I have been , and now I think it is premature but reasonable , and that it has a future as Christianity had in the first centuries . '
there used to be slaves everywhere , then vil@@ le@@ ins ; and we have labour paid in kind , and le@@ as@@ e@@ holders , and hired labour : so what are you looking for ? '
'@@ You do not want to establish anything . you simply want to be original , as you always have done , and to show that you are not just exploiting the peasants , but have ideas ! '
however much Levin tried afterwards to paci@@ fy his brother , Nicholas would not listen to it , but said that it was much better for them to part . and Levin saw that life had become simply intolerable for his brother .
Nicholas had quite made up his mind to go . Constan@@ tine came to him again and in an un@@ natural manner asked his forgiveness if he had offended him in any way .
K@@ aren@@ in made it a rule to see his wife every day , so as not to give the servants any grounds for making con@@ jec@@ tures , but he avoided dining at home .
he had been chosen to act as guide to a foreign Prince , and was obliged to show him the sights of Petersburg .
in the mor@@ nings they went sight @@@ -@@ @ seeing , and in the evenings took part in the national amus@@ ements .
in Switzerland he had shot a cham@@ ois , in England he had jumped h@@ edges in a pink coat and shot two hundred phe@@ as@@ ants for a bet .
he had been in a ha@@ re@@ m in Turkey , ridden an elephant in India , and now in Russia he wanted a taste of distinctive Russian amus@@ ements .
but , on the whole , of all the Russian amus@@ ements the Prince liked the French actresses , a ballet girl , and white @@@ -@@ @ seal champagne best .
he was obliged to be on his guard the whole time not to devi@@ ate from the path of severe official respect , for fear of being insul@@ ted .
V@@ ron@@ sky was the same , and considered it very merit@@ orious to be so , but in his relations with the Prince he was the inferior and felt indig@@ n@@ ant with that con@@ desc@@ end@@ ingly good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured treatment .
he had that winter been promoted to the rank of colonel , had left the regiment , and was living alone .
he rang for his val@@ et , dressed hur@@ ri@@ edly , and went out into the por@@ ch , having quite forgotten his dream and feeling worried only by the fact that he was late .
as he drove up to the K@@ aren@@ ins ' por@@ ch he again glanced at his watch and saw that it was ten minutes to nine .
the door opened and the hall porter with a rug over his arm called to the co@@ ach@@ man .
the gas@@ light lit up K@@ aren@@ in 's worn , bloo@@ dless face beneath the black hat , and his white tie showing from beneath the be@@ aver collar of his over@@ coat .
V@@ ron@@ sky saw him get into the carriage without looking round , take the rug and a pair of opera @@@ -@@ @ glasses through the carriage window ; then he disappeared in the darkness .
while still in the hall he heard her retre@@ ating footsteps , and knew that she had been waiting and listening for him , but had now gone back to the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room .
he looked at her as a man might look at a faded flower he had pl@@ ucked , in which it was difficult for him to trace the beauty that had made him pick and so destroy it .
they spoke of jealousy as ' the demon . ' ' yes , what had you begun telling me about the Prince ?
'@@ i don '@@ t take his part , and it is a matter of complete indifference to me , but I should say that as you did not like these pleasures you might have declined to go .
she drew up her face , half closed her eyes and quickly changed the expression of her face , folding her hands ; and V@@ ron@@ sky saw at once upon her beautiful face the very look with which K@@ aren@@ in had bowed to him .
soon , very soon , everything will get dis@@ ent@@ angled and we shall be able to rest and not tor@@ ment each other any more . '
'@@ You call it cruelty when a husband gives his wife complete freedom while he affor@@ ds her hon@@ our@@ able shelter , on the one condition that she should observe the laws of propri@@ ety .
since you wish to use that word - it is bas@@ eness to abandon a husband and a son for a lover and to go on eating the husband 's bread ! '
she did not say what she had said to her lover the day before , that V@@ ron@@ sky was her real husband and that he ( K@@ aren@@ in ) was super@@ flu@@ ous , she did not even think it .
" yes , I have even lost my affection for my son , because he is connected with my re@@ pulsion for you . but all the same I shall take him away .
one of the cler@@ ks , without rising from his chair , scre@@ wed up his eyes and addressed K@@ aren@@ in ill @@@ -@@ @ hum@@ ou@@ re@@ dly .
his face was intelligent and peasant @@@ -@@ @ like , but his dress was dan@@ di@@ fied and in bad taste .
I wish for a divorce , but the form in which it can be obtained is of importance to me .
and on K@@ aren@@ in 's nod@@ ding affirm@@ atively the lawyer continued , only occasionally casting a glance at K@@ aren@@ in 's face , which had grown red in patches .
'@@ Div@@ or@@ ce , under our laws , ' he said , with a slight shade of dis@@ approval of the laws , ' as you are aware , may be granted in the following cases ...
I should not venture so to express myself were I talking to a man of un@@ developed mind , ' said the lawyer , ' but I expect it is comprehensible to you . '
'@@ If it is so ... ' K@@ aren@@ in began , growing suddenly pale ; but at that moment the other suddenly rose and went to the door to speak to his assistant , who had again come to interrupt him .
K@@ aren@@ in H@@ AD gained a brilliant victory at the Committee Meeting of the seventeenth of August ; but the consequence of that victory undermined his power .
the subject @@@ -@@ @ races ' conditions had been investigated from the political , administrative , economic , ethno@@ graphical , material , and religious points of view .
'@@ i consider it very fine of him , ' the Princess Bet@@ sy said , referring to it in a conversation with Princess My@@ ag@@ k@@ aya . ' why should they pay for post @@@ -@@ @ horses when everybody knows that we now have railways everywhere ? '
'@@ It is all very well for you to talk who possess I don '@@ t know how many millions , ' she said . ' but I am very glad when my husband goes on inspection @@@ -@@ @ tours in summer .
it is very good for his health , and pleasant for him ; and we have an arrangement by which this allowance goes for the hire of a carriage and co@@ ach@@ man for me . '
K@@ aren@@ in unfol@@ ded the rug he had wrapped round his legs , which were so sensitive to the cold , got out of the carriage , and making his way through the snow approached Dol@@ ly .
'@@ Never mind ! tell them I will pay ! ' and nod@@ ding his head to an acquaintance who was driving past he disappeared round the corner .
having explained that he could not be there at the beginning of the performance , he promised to come for the last act , and take her to sup@@ per .
will you show me the way ? and please find out whether Count An@@ ich@@ kin ' ( the new superior ) ' will receive me . '
'@@ no , I have no time . I 've only come in for a moment , ' replied O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , throwing open his coat .
'@@ Well , what of that ? I never stop thinking of death , ' said Levin .
I consider my ideas very important , yet they too turn out to be insignificant - and would be , even if it were as possible to carry them out as it was to surround this bear .
his instinct had not deceived him ; the dreadful new superior turned out to be a most aff@@ able man . O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky had lunch with him and sat talking so long that it was going on for four when he arrived at K@@ aren@@ in 's .
she cares for Anna as for a sister , she is fond of you , and she is a wonderful woman .
as he put on his over@@ coat while walking away , his arm struck the servant 's head . he laughed and went out .
young Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky , who had not been introduced to K@@ aren@@ in , tried to look as if this did not make him feel at all awkward .
having pat@@ ted T@@ uro@@ v@@ t@@ sy@@ n on the shoulder , he whispered something funny in his ear and got him to sit down next to Dol@@ ly and the old Prince .
in a moment he had kne@@ aded all that Society d@@ ough in such a way that the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room was in first @@@ -@@ @ rate form , and was filled with animated voices .
in the depths of his soul he had felt sure that he should meet her that evening , but to maintain his freedom of thought he had tried to assure himself that he did not know it .
'@@ We spent three hours together in a railway carriage , ' said Levin with a smile , ' but we parted filled with curiosity , as people do after a mas@@ quer@@ ade , at any rate I did . '
they stood round the s@@ cent@@ ed vodka and the delic@@ acies , and the conversation about the Russi@@ fication of Poland between Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , K@@ aren@@ in , and P@@ est@@ sov gradually sl@@ ack@@ ened in the expectation of dinner .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , who knew better than anyone how at the end of a most abstract and serious dispute unexpectedly to administer a grain of At@@ tic salt and thereby to change his interloc@@ utor 's frame of mind , did so now .
'@@ the rights of passengers to a choice of seats are very ill @@@ -@@ @ defined , ' said K@@ aren@@ in , wi@@ ping the tips of his fingers on his hand@@ ker@@ chief .
'@@ i noticed that you were not quite sure what to make of me , ' said Levin with a good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured smile , ' so I ha@@ st@@ ened to start an intellectual conversation , to ex@@ pi@@ ate my sheep @@@ -@@ @ skin . '
the soup , Marie Louise , had succeeded to perfection , the tiny pas@@ ties melted in one 's mouth and were flaw@@ less .
the dinner was a success on the material side , and no less so on the non @@@ -@@ @ material side .
P@@ est@@ sov L@@ IK@@ ED TO BR@@ ING H@@ IS discussions TO A FIN@@ IS@@ H , and had not been satisfied with Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev 's remark , especially as he felt the fall@@ acy of his own opinion .
we see that the Rhine has become F@@ ren@@ chi@@ fied , yet the Germans do not stand on a lower level ! ' he shouted . ' there is some other law ! '
everybody laughed at Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev 's ' pills , ' and T@@ uro@@ v@@ t@@ sy@@ n , who had at last heard the something funny for which he had been waiting as he listened to the conversation , laughed particularly loudly and mer@@ r@@ ily .
hardly had Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev with his joke put an end to the discussion of one question before P@@ est@@ sov immediately raised another .
K@@ aren@@ in expressed the view that the higher education of women is generally conf@@ ounded with the question of women 's emancip@@ ation , and that was the only reason for considering it inj@@ ur@@ ious .
'@@ Oh yes , an Englis@@ hman on board ship did once nurse his baby , ' said the old Prince , allowing himself this ind@@ el@@ icacy in his daughters ' presence .
'@@ i really don '@@ t remember . ' ' how pleas@@ antly T@@ uro@@ v@@ t@@ sy@@ n laughs ! ' said Levin , looking with pleasure at his mo@@ ist eyes and shaking body .
'@@ Yes ? it was wonderful ! he is splendid ! ' said Dol@@ ly , looking toward T@@ uro@@ v@@ t@@ sy@@ n who felt that he was being talked about , and giving him a gentle smile .
the inequality between husband and wife , in his opinion , lay in the fact that the in@@ fidelity of a wife and that of a husband were un@@ equally punished both by law and by public opinion .
as one always seems to knock a sore place , so that day O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky felt that unfortunately the conversation kept striking K@@ aren@@ in 's sore place .
'@@ i am so glad you came , ' said Dol@@ ly with a frightened smile , as she met him in the sitting @@@ -@@ @ room through which he had to pass : ' I must speak with you .
she rose quickly , put her hand on K@@ aren@@ in 's sleeve and said , ' We shall be disturbed here , come this way , please . '
K@@ aren@@ in smiled col@@ dly with his lips only , wishing to prove to her and to himself the firm@@ ness of his conviction ; but this passionate defence , though it did not shake him , lac@@ erated his wound .
and here I am living ; my children growing , my husband returns to the family and feels his error , grows pu@@ rer and better , and I live ...
the conversation had turned to the question of village communes , in which P@@ est@@ sov saw some special principle which he called the ' chorus principle . '
Levin did not agree either with P@@ est@@ sov or with his brother Sergi@@ us , who , in a way of his own , both admitted and did not admit the importance of the Russian Commun@@ al System .
'@@ Yes , you are quite right , ' said Levin , ' for the most part , people argue so warmly only because they C@@ AN@@ NOT make out what it is that their opponent wants to prove . '
'@@ i see : one must find out what one 's opponent is cont@@ ending for , what he likes , and then one can ... '
Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky left them , and Kit@@ ty went up to a table prepared for cards , sat down , took a piece of chal@@ k , and began drawing con@@ centric circles on the new green cloth of the table .
he supported this view by saying that no family can dispen@@ se with a help , and that in every family , rich or poor , there are and must be nurses , either paid or belonging to the family .
'@@ Pl@@ aying " secretary " ? ' said the old Prince approaching them . ' come now , we must be going , if you mean to come to the theatre . '
everything had been said in that conversation . she had said that she loved him , and would tell her father and mother , and he had said that he would call in the morning .
E@@ gor , the attendant , of whom Levin had taken no notice her@@ et@@ o@@ fore , turned out to be a very intelligent , good , and above all very kind man .
it turned out that E@@ gor had a family , three boys and a girl who was a seam@@ stress and whom he wanted to marry to an assistant in a harness business .
after a long round , through the Gaz@@ et@@ ny Street and the Kis@@ lov@@ ka , he returned to the hotel , put his watch in front of him , and sat down waiting till it should be twelve .
in the next room they were saying something about machines and fraud , and c@@ ough@@ ing as people do of a morning .
trying not to offend the others , and promising to let them too drive him later on he hired one and told him to drive to the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys ' .
the iz@@ v@@ osh@@ chik knew the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys ' house , and r@@ ounding his el@@ b@@ ows in a manner specially respectful to his fare called ' Who@@ a ! ' and stopped at the por@@ ch .
the foot@@ man was young , of the new @@@ -@@ @ fashioned kind , and a d@@ andy , but a very kind and good fellow , and he too understood it all .
he put his arms round her and pressed his lips to her mouth that was waiting for his kiss .
she had prepared herself to meet him alone , and had rejo@@ iced at the idea , yet had felt tim@@ id and bas@@ h@@ ful and had not known what she would do .
'@@ Well , you see , I don '@@ t know at all ; I only expressed my wish , ' he said , to excuse himself .
the Princess went up to her husband , kis@@ sed him and was about to go away , but he stopped her , embraced her , and ten@@ derly , like a young lover , kis@@ sed her several times , with a smile .
the old couple seemed to have become confused for the moment , and not to know whether it was they who were again in love or only their daughter .
he had now mastered himself and was able to speak , and there was much he had to say to her ; but what he said was not at all what he had intended .
'@@ i am very pleased indeed , ' said S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky , ' I advise you to go to F@@ om@@ in 's for the flowers . ' -
she was religious and had never doubted the truth of her religion , but the lack of external religion in him did not affect her at all .
how was it they did not see that by giving him that post they were ru@@ ining themselves and their own prestige ?
it was from his wife , and Anna , written in blue pencil , was the first word he saw . ' I am dying .
as he entered the hall K@@ aren@@ in dragged forth his resolve as it were from a remote corner of his brain , and con@@ ned it over . it said :
there was no one in the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room , but the mid@@ wife , with l@@ il@@ ac rib@@ bons in her cap , came out of Anna 's bou@@ do@@ ir .
'@@ Be quick and bring the ice ! ' came the authoritative sound of the doctor 's voice from the bedroom .
beside the table , sitting with his side toward the back of a low chair , was V@@ ron@@ sky , his hands covering his face , we@@ eping .
I am in a hurry , because I have no time . I have not long to live , I shall soon become f@@ ever@@ ish and then I shall no longer understand anything .
but there is another in me as well , and I am afraid of her . she fell in love with that other one , and I wished to hate you but could not forget her who was before .
she put her arm round his bal@@ d head , moved closer to him , and looked up with an expression of proud defiance .
how badly those flowers are drawn , not a bit like viol@@ ets , ' and she pointed to the wallpaper .
toward morning she had become excited and animated , and her thoughts and words flowed rapidly ; but again this state lap@@ sed into un@@ consciousness .
V@@ ron@@ sky got up at once , and sto@@ oping before him looked up into his face without un@@ bending his back .
but most terrible of all was the ridiculous , shameful figure he had cut when K@@ aren@@ in was pulling his hands from before his shame @@@ -@@ @ suff@@ used face .
but with his eyes closed he could see yet more distinctly Anna 's face , as he had seen it on that memorable evening before the race .
again , following each other with great rap@@ idity , his hap@@ pi@@ est moments rose in his fancy ; and with them his recent humiliation .
going up to a door he closed it , then with fixed gaze and tightly cl@@ en@@ ched teeth , approached the table , took up his revol@@ ver , examined it , turned it to a loaded chamber , and pon@@ dered .
for a minute or two he stood mo@@ tionless with bowed head , a strained expression of effort on his face , holding the revol@@ ver in his hand .
they were the same memories of happiness lost for ever , the same thoughts of the sen@@ sel@@ essness of all that life had in store for him , and the same consciousness of his humiliation .
he did not hear the sound of a shot , but a powerful blow on the chest knocked him off his feet .
he wished to steady himself by the table , dropped the revol@@ ver , re@@ eled , and sat down on the floor , looking about him in aston@@ ishment .
but as time went on he saw more and more clearly that , however natural his position might appear to him at the time , he would not be allowed to remain in it .
K@@ aren@@ in had been in the nur@@ sery that morning , and having given orders to send for the doctor , had gone to the Department .
he noticed in all these acquaintances a kind of joy , which they suppressed with difficulty , like the joy he had noticed in the lawyer 's eyes and again just now in the foot@@ man 's .
an English nur@@ sery govern@@ ess , who since Anna 's illness had replaced the French govern@@ ess with the boy , sat doing some cro@@ ch@@ et @@@ -@@ @ work . she hur@@ ri@@ edly rose , cur@@ t@@ se@@ yed , and n@@ ud@@ ged Ser@@ ez@@ ha .
stepping on the soft carpet , as he approached the door he involun@@ tarily over@@ heard a conversation which he had no wish to hear .
'@@ Yes , but you can '@@ t but wish to say good @@@ -@@ @ bye to a man who tried to shoot himself for your sake ... '
'@@ But your face looks f@@ ever@@ ish , ' said he , emphasizing the word f@@ ever@@ ish .
she was ag@@ it@@ at@@ edly to@@ ying with the t@@ as@@ sels of her dressing @@@ -@@ @ g@@ own , gl@@ ancing at him with that tor@@ m@@ enting feeling of physical re@@ pulsion for which she blamed herself , but which she could not overcome .
before Bet@@ sy H@@ AD P@@ AS@@ SE@@ D O@@ UT of the dining @@@ -@@ @ room O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , who had just come from Elis@@ e@@ yev 's , where newly @@@ -@@ @ arrived oy@@ sters were to be had , met her in the doorway .
there is nothing for which I am more thankful than for the revival of the old custom of hand @@@ -@@ @ kis@@ sing , ' and he kis@@ sed Bet@@ sy 's hand : ' when shall I see you again ? '
'@@ He will kill her , ' said Bet@@ sy in a significant whis@@ per . ' this is impossible , impossible ... '
one of two things must happen : either he must take her away , acting energe@@ tically - or he must divorce her .
I was unhappy and thought it impossible to be more so ; but I could never have imagined such a terrible position as I am now in . will you believe it ?
knowing that he is a kind and generous man - that I am not worth his little finger - nevertheless I hate him !
again he smiled his al@@ mond @@@ -@@ @ oil smile . ' I will begin at the beginning : you married a man twenty years older than yourself .
K@@ aren@@ in smiled sadly , looked at his brother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , and without repl@@ ying went to the table and took from it an unfinished letter which he handed to him .
hard as it was for me to assure myself of this , I see that it is so , and there is no help for it .
that silence was so dis@@ concer@@ ting to both that O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's lips t@@ wit@@ ched painfully as he silently and fix@@ edly gaz@@ ed at K@@ aren@@ in 's face .
if she reads this letter she will not have the strength to say anything - she will only hang her head lower than ever . '
and this new relation can only be established when both are free . '
to leave him with his mother was not possible ; the divorced mother would have another , an illegitimate family , in which the position and education of a step@@ son would in all probability be a bad one .
but besides all this , what made divorce seem to K@@ aren@@ in more impossible than any other course was that by con@@ sent@@ ing to it he would by that very act ruin Anna .
however , do as you like ! ' and turning away so that his brother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law should not see his face , he sat down on a chair by the window .
it was very bitter , and he felt ashamed ; yet mixed with the bitterness and the shame he felt a sense of joy and emotion at the greatness of his own humility .
'@@ It is a fatal disaster and has to be faced . I regard this disaster as an accomplished fact and am trying to help both you and her , ' O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky went on .
to his cont@@ ent@@ ment was added an idea that had just occurred to him . when the affair was all settled he would ask his wife and intimate friends a rid@@ dle : ' what is the difference between me and a chemist ? '
answer : ' a chemist makes solutions which do not make anyone happy , but I have made a dissolution and made three people happy ! '
he found he could look people in the face once more , and he was able to live in accord with his former habits .
the one thing he could not tear out of his heart , although he continually struggled against it , was a regret bordering on despair at having lost Anna for ever .
it was with this message that Bet@@ sy went to Anna , and she brought him an answer in the negative .
'@@ So much the better , ' thought V@@ ron@@ sky when he heard it . ' it would have been a weakness - would have taken away all the strength I have left . '
to refuse the fl@@ attering offer of a post at Tashk@@ end , which was a dangerous one , would have seemed dis@@ graceful and impossible according to V@@ ron@@ sky 's former views .
consequently , having decided to divide her daughter 's trous@@ se@@ au into two parts , a lesser and a larger , the Princess eventually con@@ s@@ ented to have the wedding before Adv@@ ent .
this plan would be all the more convenient because the young couple intended immediately after the wedding to go to the country , where the larger part of the trous@@ se@@ au would not be required .
to him , as an ag@@ nostic who yet respected the religious beliefs of others , it was always very trying to be present at , or to take part in , any religious ceremony .
now , in his state of triumph at the flow@@ ering time of his life , he was to be obliged to lie or bl@@ asph@@ eme !
but question O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky as he would , as to whether he could not obtain a certificate without going to communion , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky declared that he must go through with it .
standing in church during the first service he attended , Levin tried to revive the memories of his youth and the strong religious feeling with which at the age of sixteen or seventeen he had been im@@ bu@@ ed .
no one else was in the church except a soldier @@@ -@@ @ beg@@ gar , two old women , and the clergy .
the young de@@ acon , the two hal@@ ves of his long back clearly distingu@@ ishable through his thin under @@@ -@@ @ cass@@ ock , met him , and going at once to a small table beside the wall , began reading the prayers .
the latter , an old man with a thin gri@@ zz@@ led beard and kind , weary eyes , stood beside the lec@@ tern turning over the leaves of a Miss@@ al .
there are hosts of aspir@@ ants who aim at mixing those two professions but I am not one of them ! '
'@@ This custom of taking leave of c@@ eli@@ b@@ acy is not without its reason , ' said Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich . ' however happy you may be , you can '@@ t help regre@@ tting your freedom . '
'@@ of course he feels so , but won '@@ t own up , ' said Kat@@ av@@ asov , and burst out laughing .
'@@ ah , but your soul is in such chaos at the present moment that you are unable to find anything there ! wait till you 've settled down a bit , then you 'll find it , ' said Kat@@ av@@ asov .
'@@ no , I should even now have some consciousness that despite my feelings ' ( he did not wish in Kat@@ av@@ asov 's presence to use the word love ) ' and my happiness I was yet sorry to lose my freedom .
a hopeless case ! ' said Kat@@ av@@ asov . ' well , let us drink to his recovery , or let us wish that at least a hundre@@ d@@ th part of his dreams come true .
when he was alone , Levin , thinking over the remarks of the three bac@@ hel@@ ors , once more asked himself whether there was in his soul any of that regret for his freedom that they had been speaking about .
'@@ But do I know her thoughts , wishes , or feelings ? ' a voice suddenly whispered .
'@@ no , this won '@@ t do ! ' he said to himself des@@ pair@@ ingly . ' I will go to her and tell her for the last time that we are now free , and that perhaps we had better keep so !
I will call you , ' said Kit@@ ty . ' what is the matter with you ? ' she asked as soon as the maid was gone .
'@@ She has scarcely eaten anything all these days and has grown quite plain ; and here you come and upset her with your nonsense ! ' said she . ' be off , be off , my dear ! '
one thing was certain : there was no time to be lost , for it was already half @@@ -@@ @ past six .
'@@ Then this is what we must do : you go and fetch him in our carriage , and Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich , if he will be so kind , will go first and will send the carriage back . '
those who had arrived too late to get into the middle of the thr@@ ong pressed round the windows , pushing and disput@@ ing and trying to peer in between the bars .
a police @@@ -@@ @ officer , un@@ mindful of the frost , stood at the entrance looking brilliant in his blue uniform .
more carriages kept driving up , and now ladies with flowers in their hair got out , holding up their trains ; or men appeared who do@@ ffed their military caps or black hats as they entered the church .
every time the door cre@@ aked every one turned round , expecting to see the bride and bri@@ deg@@ room enter .
at length the delay became awkward , and the friends and relatives tried to look as if they were not thinking about the bride and bri@@ deg@@ room but were absorbed in their conversations .
the priest continually sent a chan@@ ter or de@@ acon to see whether the bri@@ deg@@ room had arrived , and he himself , in his purple sur@@ pl@@ ice with the embroi@@ dered gir@@ dle , went with increasing frequency to the side door in expectation of the bri@@ deg@@ room .
but in the corridor there was nobody , and in despair he returned and addressed O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , who was quietly smoking .
the fact of the matter was that when Levin told his old servant Kuz@@ ma to get his things ready , Kuz@@ ma had duly brought his dress coat , wai@@ st@@ coat and what else he considered necessary .
three minutes later Levin , not looking at the clock to avoid up@@ setting himself still more , ran as fast as he could down the corridor .
'@@ It was such a stupid thing that happened ! I am ashamed to tell it , ' he said with a bl@@ ush , and was obliged to turn round to the approaching Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich .
'@@ Kit@@ ty , mind you step first upon the mat ! ' said Countess Nord@@ ston , coming up to them . ' you are a fine fellow ! ' she added , addressing Levin .
wait a moment , put your head down , ' said Kit@@ ty 's sister , Princess L@@ v@@ ova , and raising her pl@@ ump , beautiful arms she adjusted the flowers on Kit@@ ty 's head .
the handsome , tall senior de@@ acon in a silver cloth AL@@ B , his cur@@ led hair parted down the middle , came b@@ ris@@ kly forward lifting his stole with a practi@@ sed movement of two fingers , and stopped opposite the priest .
'@@ B@@ less us , Lord ! ' slowly succeeding one another , and vibr@@ at@@ ingly reson@@ ant , came the solemn tones .
then , harmon@@ iously filling the whole church from windows to v@@ aulted roof , a full ch@@ ord sung by the invisible choir rose , sw@@ elled , hung for a moment , and softly died away .
there were prayers as usual for the world above , for salvation , for the Sy@@ nod , for the Emperor , and also for the servants of God that day wed@@ ded , Constan@@ tine and Catherine .
'@@ Let us pray to the Lord that He may send them perfect love , peace , and help ! ' the whole church seemed to breathe with the senior de@@ acon 's voice .
it was a feeling of joy at the fru@@ ition of what had been for the last month and a half going on in her soul , of that which for those six weeks had gl@@ add@@ ened and tortured her .
again turning to the reading @@@ -@@ @ desk the priest with some difficulty picked up Kit@@ ty 's little ring , and asking Levin for his hand put the ring on the tip of his finger .
I was married in the evening too , ' answered Mrs. Kor@@ sun@@ skaya , and sigh@@ ed as she remembered how sweet she had looked that day , how fun@@ n@@ ily enam@@ oured her husband then was , and how different things were now .
she was looking at Kit@@ ty and thinking of the time when she would be standing there beside Count Sin@@ y@@ av@@ in , just as Kit@@ ty now stood , and how she would then remind him of his joke .
young Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky told the old M@@ aid of Hon@@ our Nikol@@ ay@@ eva that he intended to put the crown on Kit@@ ty 's ch@@ ig@@ non , to make her happy .
'@@ no , I like him very much , and not just because he will be my brother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , ' answered the Princess . ' how well he behaves !
after the usual questions of whether they wished to be married and whether they had promised themselves to others , and their answers , which sounded strange to themselves , the second part of the service began .
Kit@@ ty listened to the words of the prayer , trying to comprehend their meaning but unable to do so .
they prayed : ' that they may live in ch@@ asti@@ ty for the good of the fruits of the womb , and find joy in their sons and daughters . '
'@@ P@@ ut it quite on ! ' came the words of advice when the priest had put crow@@ ns on their heads and Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky , his hand in its three @@@ -@@ @ but@@ t@@ oned g@@ love trembling , held the crown high above Kit@@ ty 's head .
with light hearts they heard the E@@ pist@@ le read and the roll of the senior de@@ acon 's voice in the last verse , for which the outsiders present had been waiting impati@@ ently .
the spark of joy that was glowing in Kit@@ ty 's heart seemed to have spread to every one in the church .
having lifted the crow@@ ns from their heads , the priest read the last prayer and congratulated the married couple .
the priest helped him out of the difficulty , saying softly , with a smile on his kindly mouth , ' K@@ iss your wife ; and you , kiss your husband ! ' he took the candles from their hands .
he could not believe it was all true and only realized it when their surprised and tim@@ id g@@ lan@@ ces met and he felt that they were already one .
V@@ ron@@ sky took off his soft , broad @@@ -@@ @ bri@@ m@@ med hat and wiped his per@@ spir@@ ing forehead and his hair , which he had allowed to grow half @@@ -@@ @ way down his ears and wore br@@ ushed back so as to hide his bal@@ d patch .
after an absent @@@ -@@ @ minded glance at the man who was still standing there watching him , he was about to go in .
they pre@@ tended to understand completely the significance and meaning of the situation , to coun@@ tenance and even approve of it , but to consider it out of place and unnecessary to explain all this .
from her look V@@ ron@@ sky understood that she did not yet know what attitude he wished to adopt toward Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev , and was afraid she might not have behaved su@@ itably .
yet V@@ ron@@ sky was surprised at , and sorry to see , the irrit@@ able excitement with which Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev spoke on the subject that interested him .
remembering him as a thin , active , good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured , and noble boy , always at the head of his class , V@@ ron@@ sky could not understand the cause of the agitation , nor approve of it .
after trying several topics of conversation she led him on to the subject of art , about which he talked very well , and listened to him with attention .
'@@ i am very pleased about one thing , ' said Anna to Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev when they had returned to the hotel . ' Alex@@ is will have a nice studio .
'@@ Yes , I went in for it long ago , and now have begun a little , ' answered V@@ ron@@ sky with a bl@@ ush .
during TH@@ IS , THE FI@@ R@@ ST PER@@ IO@@ D of her freedom and rapid recovery , Anna was un@@ par@@ don@@ ably happy and full of the joy of life .
the memory of the evil done to her husband aroused in her a feeling akin to re@@ pulsion , such as a man might feel who when in danger of drow@@ ning had shaken off another who cl@@ ung to him .
that other was drowned ; of course it was wrong , but it had been the only way of escape and it was better not to recall such terrible details .
the desire to live , enhanced by her recovery , was so powerful , and the conditions of her life were so novel and pleasant , that Anna felt un@@ par@@ don@@ ably happy .
to her it seemed that if he knew of it he would the sooner cease to love her , and there was nothing she now feared more - though she had no reason to do so - than the loss of his love .
he painted studies from nature under the direction of an Italian professor , and studied Italian life in the Middle Ages .
medi@@ a@@ eval Italian life had at that time become so fascinating to him that he even began to wear his hat and throw his cloak across his shoulder in a medi@@ a@@ eval manner which was very becoming to him .
you know , he is one of those he@@ ath@@ en@@ ish new folk one so often meets nowadays ; you know ! one of those fre@@ e@@ thinkers who have been brought up from the beginning in dis@@ belief , neg@@ ation , and materialism .
but among us at the present day he tum@@ bled straight into the literature of neg@@ ation and rapidly assimil@@ ated the essence of the negative teaching , and there he was !
Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev pulled himself up and un@@ willingly agreed , but as the artist lived in a distant part of the town they decided to hire a carriage .
at best you are only a fool , and when you begin arguing in Italian you become a tre@@ ble fool ! ' he said at the end of a long dispute .
'@@ What a du@@ ff@@ er ! ' he mut@@ tered to himself as he seated himself at the table , and having opened a portfolio he at once set to work with particular ard@@ our at an unfinished drawing .
now he was pleased and excited by the visit to his studio of these grand Russians who had come in a carriage .
'@@ Come in , please ! ' he said , trying to put on an air of indifference , as he entered the hall and took a key from his pocket to unlock the door .
a mass of hair and a very open forehead gave a superficial significance to that face , which had an insignificant chil@@ dish , rest@@ less expression concentrated in the narrow bridge of the nose .
'@@ There ! ' he said , stepping aside with his loose g@@ ait , and pointing to the picture .
they would be in the right when they began to say fal@@ sely @@@ -@@ @ polite things in the presence of the artist , and to pity and laugh at him behind his back .
to break it and to appear calm , he made an effort and addressed Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev .
one can so well understand that man , a kind , first @@@ -@@ @ rate fellow , but an official to his very backbone , who does not know what he is doing .
the fact that this opinion was but one of a million of other opinions which - as Mikha@@ y@@ lov well knew - would all have been just did not for him de@@ tract from the importance of Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev 's remark .
in an instant his whole picture became alive before his eyes , with the in@@ expres@@ sible complexity of everything that lives .
he wished to say that it was just so that he understood Pil@@ ate , but his trembling lips would not obey him and he was unable to speak .
in Christ 's expression there should be pity because there was love in it , a peace not of this world , a readiness for death , and a knowledge of the van@@ ity of words .
of course there was an official expression in Pil@@ ate 's face and pity in Christ 's , for the former was the embodiment of car@@ nal and the latter of spiritual life .
one could walk round it , ' said Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev , showing evidently by this remark that he did not approve of the content and idea of the figure .
he had often noticed - as now when his picture was being praised - that technique was contr@@ asted with inner quality , as if it were possible to paint well something that was bad .
and the most experienced and technical painter could never paint anything by means of mechanical skill alone , if the outline of the subject @@@ -@@ @ matter did not first reveal itself to his mind .
and in almost all the figures and faces he saw traces of wrap@@ p@@ ings that had not been entirely removed and that spo@@ ilt the picture .
'@@ It is , that you have made Him a man @@@ -@@ @ God , and not a God @@@ -@@ @ man .
your picture is so good that a remark of mine C@@ AN@@ NOT do it any harm , besides which it 's only my personal opinion ... yours is different , the idea itself is different .
I consider that if Christ is to be brought down to the level of an historic figure , it would be better to choose another historic theme , a fresh one as yet untouched . '
yet Ivanov 's picture suggests both to a believer and an un@@ believer the question : is this a God or not a God ? and the unity of impression is destroyed . '
he did not even like looking at it , and had only brought it out because he was expecting an Englis@@ hman who wished to buy it .
while correcting the foot he kept gl@@ ancing at the figure of John in the background , which the visitors had not even remarked , but which he knew to be the height of perfection .
when he had completed the foot he was about to do something to that figure , but felt that he was too ag@@ itated .
there was only one stage between calm@@ ness and inspiration , at which work was possible , and to @@@ -@@ @ day he was too excited .
they said that it was impossible to deny his talent , but that his talent could not develop because of his lack of education - the common mis@@ fortune of our Russian artists .
'@@ How long have I been struggling without accompl@@ ishing anything ? ' he said , referring to the portrait he was painting ; ' and he just looked , and painted this !
V@@ ron@@ sky was more than polite to him , and was evidently interested in the artist 's opinion of his ( V@@ ron@@ sky 's ) picture .
when V@@ ron@@ sky talked about his art Mikha@@ y@@ lov remained stubbor@@ nly silent , and as stubbor@@ nly silent when they showed him V@@ ron@@ sky 's picture , and he was evidently oppressed by Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev 's dis@@ courses , to which he made no re@@ join@@ der .
Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev was the first to express the thought that was in all their minds , namely , that Mikha@@ y@@ lov was simply jeal@@ ous of V@@ ron@@ sky .
V@@ ron@@ sky took Mikha@@ y@@ lov 's part , but in the depth of his heart he believed what Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev said , for he considered that a man of that other and lower world must envy him .
he knew it was not possible to forbid V@@ ron@@ sky to tri@@ fle with art , knew that he and all the dil@@ et@@ t@@ anti had a perfect right to paint what they liked - but to him it was unpleasant .
the same thing happened to him as to Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev , who , feeling that he had nothing to express , continually deceived himself by saying that his thought had not yet ri@@ pen@@ ed and that he was bringing it to maturity and preparing materials .
but Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev was em@@ bit@@ tered and tor@@ m@@ ented by it , while V@@ ron@@ sky could not deceive and tor@@ ment himself , and above all could not become em@@ bit@@ tered .
in Petersburg V@@ ron@@ sky planned to separate his property from his brother 's , and Anna to see her son .
far an instant he was offended , but immediately knew he could not be offended with her because she was himself .
his natural feelings prompted him to justify himself and prove that she was in the wrong ; but to prove her in the wrong would mean irrit@@ ating her still more , and widening the breach which was the cause of all the trouble .
like a man half @@@ -@@ @ asleep and oppressed with pain , he wanted to tear off the aching part and cast it from him , but found on waking that the aching part was - himself .
only in the third month of their married life , after returning from Moscow where they had spent a month , did their life begin to run more smoothly .
many of his former thoughts now appeared super@@ flu@@ ous and extreme , but many omis@@ sions became clear to him when he went over the matter af@@ resh .
this is almost the first day that I have really set to work seriously and what has come of it ?
she takes no interest in our work , in the farm , in the peasants , or in music , though she is quite good at that , or in books .
he perceived that despite Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na 's grief at the advent of the new mistress who had taken the re@@ ins of management into her own hands , Kit@@ ty had conquered and had made the old woman love her .
'@@ And I say that if you go I shall go with you . I will certainly go ! ' she said hastily and an@@ gr@@ ily .
I know that my husband 's brother is dying , that my husband is going to him , and that I am going with my husband in order ... '
but just think , this matter is so important - it hurts me to think that you are mixing up with it your weakness , your dislike of remaining alone .
why , since you are rep@@ enting ? ' she said , and jumped up and ran into the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room .
he had expected to find him in that state of self @@@ -@@ @ deception which , he had heard , was frequent in consu@@ mp@@ tive cases and which had so struck him at the time of his brother 's visit to him in the autumn .
Levin at once felt the repro@@ ach in the look fixed on him , and a sense of repentance because of his own happiness .
Nicholas seemed pleased at this , but said he was afraid the condition he was in might fri@@ ghten her .
taking advantage of the first moment of silence , Levin got up , wishing to free himself if only for a few minutes from his painful sensations , and said he would fetch his wife .
stepping lightly and gl@@ ancing repeatedly at her husband , showing him a brave face full of sympathy she entered the sick @@@ -@@ @ room , and , turning without ha@@ ste , nois@@ el@@ essly closed the door .
'@@ You would not have known me again ? ' he asked , with a smile that had lit up his face at her entrance .
she had not finished speaking before that stern repro@@ ach@@ ful look of jealousy , felt by the dying for the living , settled on his face .
when he entered the sick@@ room his eyes and his attention became clou@@ ded without his being conscious of it , and he did not see or distinguish the various details of his brother 's condition .
she herself went several times to their own room and , without paying any attention to the people she met , brought back with her sheets , pillow @@@ -@@ @ cases , towels , and shirts .
he knew too that many great and vir@@ ile minds , whose thoughts on that subject he had read , had pon@@ dered it , and yet did not know a hundre@@ d@@ th part of what his wife and Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na knew on the subject .
she ordered sup@@ per to be brought , un@@ packed their things herself , helped to make the beds and did not forget to sprink@@ le insect powder on them .
it seemed to Levin that it would be in@@ exc@@ usable to eat , sleep , or even to talk , and he felt that his every movement was improper .
she , however , sorted comb@@ s and br@@ ushes , and did it all in such a way that there was nothing offensive about it .
'@@ However , we have hard days before us - let us go to bed , ' said Kit@@ ty with a glance at her tiny watch .
in his large eyes , fixed upon an icon which had been placed on a little table covered with a coloured cloth , was a look of such passionate ent@@ reat@@ y and hope that Levin was frightened at seeing it .
the invalid fell quietly asleep , but aw@@ oke half an hour later with a fit of c@@ ough@@ ing , and immediately every hope fled from those around him and from himself .
the reality of his sufferings destroyed it , leaving no trace nor even any recoll@@ ection of the former hopes , in Levin , Kit@@ ty , or the patient himself .
for a long , a very long , time as it seemed to Levin the invalid lay mo@@ tionless , but he still lived and at long intervals sigh@@ ed .
to all questions of how he felt , he gave the same answer , with an angry and repro@@ ach@@ ful look : ' I am suffering terribly , intoler@@ ably ! '
it was all a lie : a re@@ pul@@ sive , insul@@ ting , bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ous lie ; and as a result of his character , and because he loved the dying man more than the others did , Levin felt that lie most painfully .
there was no position that did not cause him pain ; no moments of for@@ get@@ fulness ; no part of his body that did not hurt and tor@@ ment him .
his life was quite swallowed up in a consciousness of suffering and a desire to be released from it .
therefore all his desires were merged into one : a desire to be released from all this pain and from its source - his body .
having finished the prayer , the priest touched the cold forehead with his cross which he then wrapped in his stole , and after standing in silence another two minutes , touched the enormous bloo@@ dless hand , which was growing cold .
'@@ He has passed away , ' said the priest and turned to go ; but suddenly the clam@@ my mou@@ st@@ ache of the dying man moved and from the depth of his chest through the sti@@ ll@@ ness came his voice , sharp and distinct :
the first two days after his wife 's departure K@@ aren@@ in received peti@@ tion@@ ers , and his private secretary , attended Committee Meetings , and went to the dining @@@ -@@ @ room to dinner as usual .
without rendering account to himself why he did it , during those two days he tried with all his might to appear calm and even indifferent .
their uncle , K@@ aren@@ in , a high official and at one time a favourite with the late Emperor , brought them up .
there was a fellow @@@ -@@ @ student at the university with whom he had subsequently become friendly , and to whom he might have spoken of his grief ; but that fellow @@@ -@@ @ student was now curator in a distant educational district .
the other person , the doctor , was also well @@@ -@@ @ inclined toward K@@ aren@@ in , but they had long ago come to a tacit understanding that they were both overwhelmed with work and had no time to spare .
'@@ J '@@ ai forc@@ é la con@@ sig@@ ne ! [ ' I 've forced my way in . ' ] she said as she entered with hur@@ ried steps , breathing heavily from her rapid movement and from excitement .
the Countess went to Ser@@ ez@@ ha 's part of the house and there , wat@@ ering the frightened boy 's cheeks with her tears , told him that his father was a saint and that his mother was dead .
the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna when quite a young and ec@@ static girl was married to a rich , arist@@ ocratic , very good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured , and most jo@@ vial prof@@ lig@@ ate .
a young ad@@ j@@ ut@@ ant , a com@@ rade of V@@ ron@@ sky 's , through whom she had her information , who hoped through her influence to obtain a concession , told her that they had finished their affairs and were leaving Petersburg next day .
I address myself to you , instead of to Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich , only because I do not wish to give pain to that high @@@ -@@ @ minded man by reminding him of myself .
everything in that letter irrit@@ ated the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna : its matter , the hint contained in the word ' mag@@ n@@ anim@@ ity , ' and especially what seemed to her its free and easy tone .
meeting as they were going out , acquaintances chat@@ ted about the latest news , the newly awarded hon@@ ours , and the changes among the highest officials .
soon after the par@@ ting with his wife he began writing a pam@@ ph@@ let on the new legal procedure , the first of an innumerable series of unwanted pam@@ ph@@ lets on every administrative department which it was his fate to write .
Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna 's dress had cost her a great deal of trouble , as was the case with all her at@@ tire of late .
as he now ran the g@@ aun@@ t@@ let of those mo@@ cking eyes he was drawn toward her enam@@ oured look as naturally as a plant is drawn toward the sun .
when K@@ aren@@ in entered the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna 's sn@@ u@@ g little bou@@ do@@ ir , which was full of old china and had its walls covered with portraits ; the host@@ ess was not yet there .
upon a round table covered with a cloth stood a Chinese tea service and a silver kettle over a spirit lamp .
K@@ aren@@ in glanced absent @@@ -@@ @ min@@ dedly at the num@@ ber@@ less familiar portraits decor@@ ating the bou@@ do@@ ir , and sitting down by the table opened a New Testament that was on it .
granted that you have forgiven her , and do forgive her ; but have we the right to act thus toward the soul of that angel ?
'@@ If you ask my advice , ' she said , when her prayer was ended and she uncovered her face , ' I do not advise you to do it !
the memory of the letter he had written to her also tor@@ m@@ ented him ; above all his forgiveness , which no one wanted , and his care for another man 's child , burned his heart with shame and regret .
and there rose before his mind 's eye a whole row of those vigorous , strong , self @@@ -@@ @ assured men , who had always involun@@ tarily attracted his curiosity and attention .
'@@ Ser@@ ez@@ ha ! ' said his tutor , a S@@ lav , stopping in the doorway that led to the inner rooms , ' take it off yourself . '
Ser@@ ez@@ ha had met him in the hall , and had heard him pit@@ e@@ ously begging the porter to announce him to K@@ aren@@ in , and saying that he and his children were face to face with death .
this joy appeared to him particularly important because it coincided with the satisfaction of the official , and his own happiness that a present had been brought .
in these reflections time passed until the teacher arrived . the lesson on the attributes of Time , Place , and Man@@ ner of Action had not been learnt .
Ser@@ ez@@ ha jumped up , approached his father , kis@@ sed his hand , and looked at him attentively , trying to find some sign of his joy at receiving the Order of Alexander Nevsky .
I am dis@@ pleased with you , and Peter Ig@@ nat@@ ych ' - this was the chief educ@@ ation@@ alist - ' is also dis@@ pleased with you ...
his father from his point of view considered that the boy did not try to learn what he was being taught .
you 'd better tell me , ' said Vasily Luk@@ ich , smiling , which he rarely did . ' well , lie down , and I 'll put out the candle . '
his mother and his sister @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law received him just as usual , asked him about his trip abroad and spoke of mutual acquaintances , but did not say a single word about his union with Anna .
she , he thought , would cast no stones , but would simply and resolutely go and see Anna and receive her at her own house .
'@@ But we must call things by their real names . you wish me to go and see her and to receive her , and so rehabilit@@ ate her in Society ; but please understand that I C@@ AN@@ NOT do it !
at one moment she appeared to be in love with him , and at the next would turn cold , irrit@@ able , and im@@ penetr@@ able .
the nearer they came to Petersburg the greater its joy and importance appeared .
it was painful to her even to think of writing to and coming into contact with her husband : she could be calm only when she did not think of him .
next morning Anna went alone , and at eight o 'clock got out of the hired carriage and rang the bell at the front door of the house which used to be her home .
now he was not even as she had left him ; he was still further removed from the four @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old child ; he had grown still more and had got thinner .
but still it was he : the slope of the head was his , the lips were his , the soft neck and the broad shoulders .
Kor@@ ney , the val@@ et , went down into the hall @@@ -@@ @ porter 's room to inqu@@ ire who had let her in , and hearing that it was Kap@@ it@@ on@@ ich who had done so , he re@@ pri@@ man@@ ded the old man .
the hall @@@ -@@ @ porter remained obst@@ in@@ ately silent ; but when the val@@ et said he ' ought to get the sack , ' Kap@@ it@@ on@@ ich rushed at Kor@@ ney and , flourishing his hands about before Kor@@ ney 's face , began to speak out :
I 've been in service here ten years , and have had nothing but kindness : you had better go up and tell her , " You be off , please ! "
she was listening to the sound of his voice , saw his face and the play of his features , felt his hands , but did not understand what he was saying .
Ser@@ ez@@ ha , with bright eyes and be@@ aming smile , holding his mother with one hand and his nurse with the other , jumped with his pl@@ ump bare feet on to the carpet .
she had not had time even to un@@ wrap the toys she had chosen with so much love and sadness the day before , and she took them back with her .
'@@ Yes , it is all ended and I am alone again , ' she said to herself ; and without taking off her bon@@ net she sat down in an easy @@@ -@@ @ chair by the fireplace .
V@@ ron@@ sky was examining her son 's photos , which she had forgotten on the table , and did not hurry to look at her .
but of course you don '@@ t care for life abroad , ' she went on with a pleasant smile : ' I know you and know all your tastes , though we have met so seldom . '
'@@ Then we shall not meet again ? ' said Y@@ ash@@ vin , rising ; and then turning to V@@ ron@@ sky he asked , ' Where are you dining ? '
he decided that it was necessary to have an explanation with her , and he waited for her in the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room .
the Princess asked to be exc@@ used for not coming to say good @@@ -@@ @ bye ; she was not well , but asked Anna to come and see her between half @@@ -@@ @ past six and nine .
'@@ i 'm sorry that between half @@@ -@@ @ past six and nine is just the time when I C@@ AN@@ NOT come , ' she replied with a faint smile .
after dinner T@@ ush@@ kevich went to get a box and Y@@ ash@@ vin to have a smoke . V@@ ron@@ sky went with Y@@ ash@@ vin down to his own rooms , but after sitting with him a while , ran up@@ stairs again .
he saw all the beauty of her face and of her dress , which suited her as her dresses always did .
Y@@ ash@@ vin emp@@ tied another glass of brandy into the sparkling water , drank it , and then rose , but@@ t@@ oning his coat .
'@@ With a wife one has trouble , but with one who is not a wife it 's worse , ' thought Y@@ ash@@ vin as he left the hotel .
through a door slightly aj@@ ar came the sounds of a mu@@ ff@@ led st@@ acc@@ ato accompan@@ iment by the orchestra and of a female voice rendering a musical phrase with precision .
the door was closed immediately and he did not hear the end of the phrase nor the tr@@ ill after it , but knew from the thunder of applause behind the door that the tr@@ ill was finished .
'@@ How little of the military man is left in you ! ' remarked Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy . ' you might be a diplom@@ atist , an artist , or anything of that kind . '
'@@ Yes , as soon as I returned home I put on a black coat , ' V@@ ron@@ sky replied with a smile , slowly taking out his opera @@@ -@@ @ glasses .
I , when I come back from abroad and put this on again , regret my freedom , ' he said , touching his shoulder @@@ -@@ @ knot .
next to a lady wearing a Tur@@ ban , and a bal@@ d old man who blin@@ ked an@@ gr@@ ily just as V@@ ron@@ sky 's moving glass reached him , he suddenly saw Anna 's proud head , strikingly beautiful , and smiling in its frame of lace .
the wife , a thin little woman , was standing up in her box with her back to Anna , putting on an opera @@@ -@@ @ cloak which her husband was holding for her .
K@@ art@@ asov , a st@@ out bal@@ d @@@ -@@ @ headed man , kept gl@@ ancing round at Anna while trying to paci@@ fy his wife .
but Anna , with obvious intention , took no notice of him and , turning round , was saying something to Y@@ ash@@ vin , whose cro@@ pped head was bent toward her .
having conducted the Princess Sor@@ ok@@ ina back to V@@ ron@@ sky 's mother , Var@@ ya held out her hand to her brother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law and at once began to talk of the matter that interested him .
'@@ i have been expecting you all the time , ' said his mother with a sar@@ cas@@ tic smile . ' I never see anything of you . '
V@@ ron@@ sky did not reply , and after a few words addressed to the Princess Sor@@ ok@@ ina he left the box .
he hur@@ ried down@@ stairs feeling that he must do something , he knew not what .
when V@@ ron@@ sky entered she was still dressed as she had been at the theatre .
the house on her own estate was quite dil@@ ap@@ id@@ ated , so Levin and his wife persuaded her to spend the summer with them .
and Kit@@ ty , who conducted her household with great assi@@ du@@ ity , had no little trouble to proc@@ ure all the chickens , tur@@ keys , and duc@@ ks , of which , with the visitors ' and the children 's summer appe@@ ti@@ tes very many were required .
Kit@@ ty stood near her husband , evidently waiting for the end of the conversation - which did not interest her - before speaking to him .
'@@ K@@ ate , it is not good for you to be standing , ' said her husband , with a meaning look , moving a chair toward her .
in advance of them all , at a side@@ ways gal@@ lo@@ p , came T@@ anya in tightly pulled @@@ -@@ @ up stock@@ ings , running toward Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , flourishing a basket and his hat .
'@@ i must look at the new w@@ agg@@ ons , and count them , ' said Levin . ' and where will you be ? '
'@@ Steve says it 's better to give them money , ' Dol@@ ly remarked , returning to the interesting topic of what presents it was best to give to the servants , ' but ... '
'@@ But don '@@ t get excited ; there is no need at all for you to get excited , ' admon@@ ished her mother .
'@@ Well ? ' he asked , looking at her with the expression with which every one addressed her nowadays .
'@@ Well , Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na , is the jam done ? ' asked Levin , smiling at her and wishing to che@@ er her up . ' has it turned out well the new way ? '
they had nothing to say to one another , but he wanted to hear the sound of her voice , which like her look had been changed by pregnancy .
'@@ no , but he is so used to living a purely spiritual life that he C@@ AN@@ NOT reconcile himself to realities , and , after all , V@@ aren@@ ka is a reality ! '
'@@ Oh no ! he is very fond of you , and it is always such a pleasure to me when my people are fond of you . '
'@@ no . I feel it now more than ever - and it is your fault , ' he answered , pressing her arm , ' that it 's not the right thing .
'@@ Well then , we won '@@ t count this tiny one , ' said he , picking off a short ill @@@ -@@ @ formed pet@@ al . ' and here 's the trap over@@ taking us . '
'@@ If it is so , I must think it over and come to a decision , and not let myself be carried away like a boy by the impulse of the moment , ' he told himself .
suddenly , from the skirts of the wood not far off , he heard V@@ aren@@ ka 's contr@@ al@@ to voice calling to G@@ ris@@ ha , and a smile of pleasure lit up his face .
but it is nothing of the kind . the one thing I can find against it is that when I lost Marie I told myself that I would remain true to her memory .
she had all the charm and fresh@@ ness of youth but was no longer a child , and if she loved him , loved him consciously as a woman ought to love . that was one favourable consideration .
I have lived many years , and now in you for the first time I have met what I was in search of .
'@@ i have only heard that the white bol@@ eti grow chiefly on the outskirts , but I can '@@ t even tell which are the white ones . '
she was frightened : frightened of what he might or might not say .
'@@ What is it , Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na ? ' Kit@@ ty asked suddenly when the old woman stopped in front of her with a look of mystery and importance .
even in the Lev@@ ins ' well @@@ -@@ @ ordered household she found ways to be of use . ' I will see about sup@@ per , ' she said , ' and you stay here ' ; and she rose to accompany Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na .
it must be Pap@@ a ! ' shouted Levin , who had stopped at the bend of the avenue . ' Kit@@ ty , don '@@ t come down those steep steps , go round ! '
it was long since the farm work had seemed so important to him as it did that evening .
'@@ Yes ! do let 's go ! ' cried V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky , changing from one chair to another and sitting side@@ ways with one of his fat legs doubled under him .
Levin remained at the other end of the table , and while not c@@ easing to talk with the Princess and V@@ aren@@ ka saw that O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , Dol@@ ly , Kit@@ ty , and V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky were carrying on an animated and mysterious conversation .
moreover , he saw his wife had an expression of serious feeling as she gaz@@ ed attentively at Vas@@ enka 's handsome face while he was vi@@ v@@ aci@@ ously nar@@ rating something .
meanwhile Vas@@ enka , without the least suspicion of the sufferings his presence was causing , rose from the table after Kit@@ ty and followed her , smiling pleas@@ antly .
please let 's go ! ' said Vas@@ enka , sitting down and once more doubling his leg under him , as his habit was .
'@@ Come , Ko@@ st@@ ya , you are exagg@@ erating ! ' re@@ monstr@@ ated Kit@@ ty , at the bottom of her heart pleased by the force of love for her which was now expressing itself in his jealousy .
'@@ the worst of it all is that you - are as you always are , and now when you are my holy of hol@@ ies and we are so happy - so specially happy - suddenly this good @@@ -@@ @ for @@@ -@@ @ nothing comes along ...
'@@ Well then , I will keep him here all the summer on purpose . I will lav@@ ish atten@@ tions on him , ' said Levin , kis@@ sing her hands .
at length the door opened nois@@ ily and out b@@ ounded , spinning round and round in the air , Kra@@ k , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's yellow spotted pointer , followed by O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky himself with a gun in his hand and a ci@@ gar in his mouth .
Vas@@ enka had been ignorant that the sty@@ lis@@ hness of a real sport@@ sman consists in being dressed in r@@ ags but having one 's shooting implements of the very best quality .
'@@ Why , but three steps will add to its length as well ... Where will it get to ? '
when they had gone about three ver@@ sts , V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky suddenly missed his ci@@ gars and pocket @@@ -@@ @ book , and did not know whether he had lost them or left them on his table .
he had three hundred and seventy roubles in the pocket @@@ -@@ @ book , and therefore the matter could not be ignored .
so the co@@ ach@@ man rode back on the side @@@ -@@ @ horse and Levin drove the other two himself .
Levin himself felt inclined to stop at those little places , but , as they were near home , they were always within his reach and they were small , so that there was not room enough for three persons to shoot there .
when they came to a small mar@@ sh he wished to drive past it , but O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , with the practi@@ sed eye of a sport man , noticed the marsh@@ y place from the road .
suddenly the horses started , Levin knocked his head against the barrel of some one 's gun , and there was a report .
when they reached the second mar@@ sh , which was of considerable size and would take a good deal of time Levin tried to dissu@@ ade them from getting out .
L@@ aska , who had long been wh@@ ining plain@@ tively , as if complaining of the injustice , rushed straight forward to a likely spot covered with hum@@ mo@@ cks and known to Levin , where Kra@@ k had not yet been .
when everything was in order and the vehicles had been brought back to the road , Levin gave orders for lunch to be served .
it 's a splendid mar@@ sh , and I see there are hawks too , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , pointing at two large birds cir@@ cling above the se@@ dges . ' where there are hawks , there is sure to be game . '
Levin knew L@@ aska 's method of search - careful and dubious ; he knew it , and expected to see a flight of sni@@ pe .
Vas@@ enka had fired into a flight of duc@@ ks that were cir@@ cling above the mar@@ sh far out of range and were at that moment flying straight toward the sportsmen .
Levin had barely time to turn , before he heard the cry of a sni@@ pe , then another , and a third , and about eight more rose one after the other .
meanwhile from the opposite side of the mar@@ sh came not frequent but , as it seemed to Levin , significant reports from O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's gun , followed almost every time by a cry to the dog , ' Kra@@ k ! Kra@@ k !
the cry near the ground and sound in the air came incess@@ antly from every side . the sni@@ pe that had risen previously and had been flying about descended in front of the sportsmen .
though there was little hope of finding as many birds in the un@@ m@@ own strips as on the m@@ own part , Levin , having promised O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky to meet him , went with his companion farther on over the m@@ own and un@@ m@@ own strips .
'@@ Come along ! never mind ! ' shouted a mer@@ ry , bear@@ ded , red @@@ -@@ @ faced peasant ; showing a row of white teeth and holding alo@@ ft a green@@ ish vodka bottle that glit@@ tered in the sunshine .
I should go and have a drink , ' said Levin , not quite dis@@ interest@@ edly , hoping that the vodka would temp@@ t V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky and lure him away .
at last , after a dis@@ graceful miss , he threw his gun , and hat on the ground .
Kra@@ k , quite black with sm@@ elly mar@@ sh sli@@ me , sprang out from beneath the up@@ turned root of an al@@ der with the air of a conqu@@ er@@ or and sni@@ ffed at L@@ aska .
do they keep vodka for sale ? ' said the soldier who had at last succeeded in dragging off one wet boot together with a black@@ ened stoc@@ king .
after fluctu@@ ating between recoll@@ ections and stories of the shooting , of dogs , and of other shooting parties , the talk reached a theme that interested all three .
'@@ i don '@@ t understand you , ' said Levin , rising on his heap of ha@@ y . ' how is it that those people don '@@ t dis@@ gust you ?
'@@ i don '@@ t give it away because nobody demands that of me , and if I wanted to I could not do it , ' replied Levin ; ' besides , there is no one to give it to . '
'@@ If only one could ... go without getting up ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , stretching himself . ' it 's delightful to lie still . '
Ven@@ ez v@@ ite ! ' [ gentlemen , come quickly . ] came the voice of V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky , who had come back .
Levin pre@@ tended to be asleep , but O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , having put on his slippers and lit a ci@@ gar , left the bar@@ n , and their voices soon died away .
I am not man@@ ly with her , I have grown eff@@ em@@ inate ...
only one of them was laz@@ ily eating o@@ ats , sc@@ attering them over the edge of the tr@@ ough .
'@@ Why have you risen so early , my dear ? ' said his aged host@@ ess , who came out of her hu@@ t , addressing him cor@@ di@@ ally as a good old acquaintance .
one of her ears had turned back while she ran , she breath@@ ed heavily but cauti@@ ously , and yet more cauti@@ ously looked toward her master , turning her eyes rather than her head .
from here I scent them , but if I go forward I shall not know what I am doing , nor where they are nor who they are . '
but now he pushed her with his knee , saying in an excited whis@@ per , ' Se@@ ize it , L@@ aska ! seize it ! '
after flying some twenty feet , the second sni@@ pe rose at an acute angle , and then , turning round and round like a ball , fell heavily on a dry spot .
a haw@@ k had woke up and was sitting on a ha@@ y@@ cock , turning its head from side to side and looking dis@@ cont@@ ent@@ edly at the mar@@ sh .
'@@ He has an appetite ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , laughing and pointing to Vas@@ enka V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky . ' I don '@@ t suffer from lack of appetite , but he 's quite surprising ... '
'@@ the beef has been eaten , and the bone was given to the dogs , ' answered Philip .
in the evening they again went out shooting , when V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky also killed some birds , and late at night they set off home .
'@@ We had fine sport , and so many new impressions ! ' said V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky , approaching Kit@@ ty , who sat at the sam@@ ov@@ ar . ' what a pity ladies are deprived of that pleasure . '
again , as on the previous occasion , he suddenly , without the least interval , felt thrown from the height of happiness , peace , and dignity into an abyss of despair , mal@@ evol@@ ence , and degradation .
Vas@@ enka only rose for a moment , and with the absence of polit@@ eness to women which is characteristic of modern young men , barely bowed and again continued his conversation , laughing at something .
he did not look her in the face and did not notice that she ( in her condition ) stood with her whole face t@@ wit@@ ching , and had a p@@ iti@@ ful , crushed appearance .
'@@ the servants are there , in the pan@@ try , ' he said an@@ gr@@ ily ; ' don '@@ t make a scene . '
the little girl burst into so@@ bs and buried her face in her mother 's lap , and Dol@@ ly placed her thin tender hand on the child 's head .
on the table lay a piece of stick which when doing gymnastics that morning they had broken , trying to raise the war@@ ped parallel bars .
Levin turned away from him quickly and went far down one of the avenues , where he continued walking up and down alone .
the road was good , the cal@@ è@@ che comfortable , the horses ran mer@@ r@@ ily , and on the box beside the co@@ ach@@ man instead of a foot@@ man sat an office cler@@ k whom Levin sent with her for safety .
of course Steve is not to be counted on , but with the help of kind people I shall start them somehow ... But in case of another child ... '
this answer had seemed horrible to Dol@@ ly , despite the good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured sweet@@ ness of the young woman 's looks , but now she could not help recalling it .
Dol@@ ly sh@@ ud@@ dered at the mere thought of the pain she had endured from sore nip@@ ples , from which she had suffered with almost every baby .
even now , if we had not spent this summer with Ko@@ st@@ ya and Kit@@ ty , I don '@@ t know how we should have managed .
all the faces turned toward her seemed to Dol@@ ly to be healthy and bright , mo@@ cking her with their joy in life .
the co@@ ach@@ man ST@@ OP@@ PE@@ D THE horses and looked round toward a field of ry@@ e on the right , where some peasants sat beside a cart .
the cur@@ ly @@@ -@@ @ headed old man , with a piece of b@@ ast tied round his head , his rounded back dark with per@@ spir@@ ation , increased his speed , approached the cal@@ è@@ che and put his sun@@ burnt arm on the mud @@@ -@@ @ guard .
'@@ i tell you it 's just there , where you come out , ' and he went on rubbing his hand along the mud @@@ -@@ @ guard of the cal@@ è@@ che .
'@@ There , you see , when you 've turned to the left you 'll knock straight up against it , ' said the peasant , evidently unwilling to let them go , and wishing to talk .
it was V@@ ron@@ sky with his j@@ ockey , V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky and Anna on horse@@ back , and Princess Barbara with S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky in the cha@@ r @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ Ban@@ c .
'@@ You can have no idea how pleased we are that you have come ; ' he said , putting peculiar emphasis into his words , while a smile exposed his strong white teeth .
Anna noticed Dol@@ ly 's expression , became confused , bl@@ ushed , let her habit slip out of her hands , and stum@@ bled over it .
but what struck her most was the change that had taken place in Anna , whom she knew and loved .
another woman less observ@@ ant , who had not known Anna before , especially one who had not thought the thoughts that were in Dol@@ ly 's mind on the way , would not have noticed anything peculiar in Anna .
the cler@@ k , to hide his embarrassment , bust@@ led about , helping the ladies in , but Philip became mor@@ ose and made up his mind not to be imposed upon by this eternal superiority .
Anna , turning her eyes away from her friend and scre@@ wing them up ( this was a new habit of hers and unfamiliar to Dol@@ ly ) , grew thoughtful , trying thoroughly to grasp the meaning of the remark .
'@@ They are the employees ' houses , the stu@@ d farm , and the st@@ ables , ' answered Anna . ' and here the park begins .
he is very fond of this estate , and - a thing I never expected of him - he is quite enthusiastic in managing the place .
he has grown into a first @@@ -@@ @ rate , prudent land@@ lord , as I recognize ; in farming matters he is even st@@ ing@@ y , but only in farming .
the peasants asked him to let them some meadows at a reduced rent , I think , and he refused , and I repro@@ ached him with being st@@ ing@@ y .
of course it was not that alone , but one thing with another caused him to start that hospital , to show , you know , that he is not st@@ ing@@ y .
'@@ How fine ! ' said Dol@@ ly , looking with involun@@ tary surprise at a handsome house with a row of columns standing out among the vari@@ ously tin@@ ted fol@@ i@@ age of the old trees in the garden .
they drove into a grav@@ elled courtyard surrounded by flowers , where two men were making a border of rough por@@ ous stones round a well @@@ -@@ @ for@@ ked flower @@@ -@@ @ bed and stopped beneath a roof@@ ed por@@ tic@@ o .
where is the Count ? ' she asked the two elegant foot@@ men who had rushed out . ' Ah , there he is ! ' she went on , seeing V@@ ron@@ sky and V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky coming out to meet her .
well , let 's go in , ' said Anna , who had given her favourite horse the sugar the foot@@ man had brought .
the bed had a spring and an over@@ lay matt@@ ress , with a specially shaped bolster and small pil@@ lows with silk sli@@ ps .
the marble wash@@ stand , the dressing @@@ -@@ @ table , the couch , the tables , the bronze clock on the man@@ tel@@ piece , the curtains and door @@@ -@@ @ hang@@ ings were all costly and new .
the smart lady 's maid with hair sty@@ lis@@ h@@ ly done , and wearing a dress more fashionable than Dol@@ ly 's , who came to offer her services , was as new and expensive as everything else in the room .
at home it was clear that six jackets required twenty @@@ -@@ @ four ar@@ sh@@ ins of n@@ ain@@ s@@ ook at sixty @@@ -@@ @ five kop@@ eks , which comes to more than fifteen roubles , besides the trim@@ m@@ ings and the work ; and she had saved all that .
we wanted to send her back , but the child is so used to her that we are still keeping her . '
that is , her name is K@@ aren@@ ina , ' said Anna , scre@@ wing up her eyes till only the meeting l@@ ashes could be seen . ' however , we will talk about all that later , ' said she , suddenly bri@@ ghtening .
here were per@@ am@@ bul@@ ators ordered from England , an apparatus to teach a baby to walk , a specially constructed piece of furniture like a billi@@ ard @@@ -@@ @ table for the baby to crawl on , swings , and baths of a new special kind .
when they entered the little girl was sitting in her chem@@ ise in a little arm @@@ -@@ @ chair at a table , having her dinner of bro@@ th which she was sp@@ illing all over her little chest .
would you believe it , I am just like a starving woman to whom a full meal has been served , and who does not know what to begin on first ?
then there 's the doctor , a young man , not exactly a nihil@@ ist , but - you know , eats with his knife ... but a very good doctor .
their conversation was interrupted by Anna , who had found the men in the billi@@ ard @@@ -@@ @ room and brought them back with her to the ver@@ and@@ ah .
'@@ no , it 's too hot : better let 's walk through the garden and go for a row , to let Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na see the banks , ' suggested V@@ ron@@ sky .
as is frequently the case with irre@@ pro@@ ach@@ ably moral women who become tired of the mon@@ ot@@ ony of a moral life , she from a distance not only exc@@ used a guilty love but even envi@@ ed it .
in particular it was dis@@ agre@@ eable to her to see the Princess Barbara , who for@@ gave them everything for the sake of the comforts she enjoyed there .
in general , in the abstract Dol@@ ly approved the step Anna had taken , but it was unpleasant to her to see the man for whose sake the step had been taken .
she experienced the same kind of sh@@ y@@ ness in his presence that she had felt when the lady 's maid saw her jacket .
and he began , at first with reserve but more and more carried away by his subject , to draw her attention to various details of the ador@@ n@@ ment of the house and garden .
one could see that , having devoted great pains to the improvement and decoration of his place , V@@ ron@@ sky felt compelled to boast of them to a fresh person , and was hear@@ tily pleased by Dol@@ ly 's pra@@ ises .
beside the finished building another as yet surrounded by sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding was being built . work@@ men wearing ap@@ rons stood on the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding laying bricks , pouring water from wooden p@@ ails , or smoo@@ thing the mortar .
'@@ That will be the doctor 's quarters and the dispens@@ ary , ' replied V@@ ron@@ sky ; and seeing the architect in his short jacket coming toward them , he apologi@@ zed to the ladies and went to meet him .
I see that Anna is happy , quite happy , she has already told me so , ' said Dol@@ ly smiling ; and involun@@ tarily while saying it she doubted whether Anna was really happy .
'@@ Well , this brings me to the point of my talk , ' he went on , cal@@ ming himself with an effort . ' Anna can do it ; . it depends on her ...
even to be able to petition the Emperor for permission to adopt the child , a divorce will be necessary , and that depends on Anna .
and she remembered that it was just when the intimate side of life was in question that Anna scre@@ wed up her eyes .
the conversation passed on to the abuses in the government of the United States , but Anna quickly turned it to another theme so as to draw the ste@@ ward out of his silence .
I saw one at the Vienna Exhibition that bound the she@@ aves with wire , ' remarked S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky . ' that kind would be more profitable , '
'@@ What a pity ! ' said Anna , and having thus paid the tribute of polit@@ eness to the ret@@ ain@@ ers , she turned to her friends .
'@@ Then we may expect to see you at the next Session , Count ? ' asked S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky . ' but you must come in good time , so as to be there on the eighth .
formerly we used to have so many officials that there had to be an official for everything that was done , and now we have public workers for everything !
of how many institutions are you a member , Nicholas Ivan@@ ich ? ' she asked , addressing S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky ; ' more than twenty , is@@ n '@@ t it ? '
the players , having chosen their partners , took their places on the carefully lev@@ elled and rolled cro@@ quet lawn , on the two sides of a net stretched between two small gil@@ ded pillars .
Dol@@ ly tried to play , but was long unable to understand the game , and by the time she did understand it she was so tired that she sat down beside the Princess Barbara to watch the others .
when , after evening tea and a row in the boat at night @@@ -@@ @ time , Dol@@ ly entered her bedroom alone , took off her dress and sat down to do up her thin hair for the night , she felt great relief .
several times during the day Anna had begun to talk about intimate matters , but after a few words she had always paused , saying : ' later on when we are alone we will talk it all over .
if he looks for that sort of thing he will find women whose dresses and manners are still brighter and more attractive .
by the very fact of their birth they would have to be ashamed of their mother , their father , their birth ! '
the question for you is , whether you desire not to have any more children ; for me it is , whether I desire to have them .
'@@ Yes , if possible , ' Anna said , in what had suddenly become quite a different - a quiet and sad - voice .
'@@ Well then , we won '@@ t , ' Dol@@ ly ha@@ st@@ ened to say , noticing the look of pain on Anna 's face . ' but I see that you look at things too dis@@ m@@ ally . '
I not consider that ! ' she repeated , and fl@@ ushed .
recoll@@ ections of home and of her children rose in her imagination with a new and peculiar charm .
that world of her own now seemed so precious and dear that she did not wish on any account to spend another day away from it , and she decided certainly to go home on the mor@@ row .
when they had driven into the fields Dol@@ ly experienced a pleasant feeling of relief , and she was about to ask the men how they had liked the V@@ ron@@ sk@@ ys ' place , when suddenly Philip the co@@ ach@@ man himself remarked :
in the absence of visitors Anna still continued to devote attention to her person , and read a great deal - both novels and such serious books as were in fashion .
he was ast@@ ounded at her knowledge and memory , and at first used to doubt her information and want it confirmed . she would then find what he wanted in books and show it him .
had it not been for this ever @@@ -@@ @ increasing desire for freedom - not to have a scene each time he had to go to town to a meeting or to the races - V@@ ron@@ sky would have been quite content with his life .
in spite of the tremendous sums the hospital , the machinery , the cows which he imported from Switzerland , and many other things were costing him , he was sure that he was not wasting his substance but increasing it .
where it was a question of income - the sale of forest land , of corn or wool , or the leasing of land - V@@ ron@@ sky was as hard as fl@@ int and could hold out for his price .
in October there were the Nob@@ ility elections in the Kash@@ in Province , in which V@@ ron@@ sky 's , S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky 's , Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev 's , and also a small part of Levin 's estates were situated .
people living in Moscow and Petersburg as well as others from abroad , who had never come to any elections , assembled at these .
Levin was still waver@@ ing , but Kit@@ ty , who had noticed that he was dull in Moscow and had advised him to go , without saying anything to him ordered for him the uniform necessary for the occasion , which cost eighty roubles .
Levin had been five days in Kash@@ in , going daily to meetings and taking a great deal of trouble over his sister 's business , which he was still unable to arrange .
the Mar@@ sh@@ als of the Nob@@ ility were all busy with the elections , and he could not get even the simple matter in connection with the wardship settled .
everybody was kind and am@@ i@@ able , but still it turned out that what he wanted to circumvent started up again in another place and impeded him once more .
he always sided with the Nob@@ ility in everything , openly opposed the spread of popular education , and gave a class character to the Zem@@ st@@ vo , which should have such enormous importance .
to replace S@@ net@@ kov as Mar@@ sh@@ al , S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky was proposed , or , better still , Nev@@ ed@@ ovsky , an ex @@@ -@@ @ professor , a remarkably intelligent man , and a great friend of Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev 's .
in the cathedral Levin , with the others , raised his hand , repeating the words of the priest , and s@@ wore by the most awful o@@ aths to fulfil all the things the Governor had hoped for .
on the fourth day the audit of the Prov@@ in@@ cial Fun@@ ds was undertaken , and now for the first time there was a conflict between the new and old parties .
there@@ upon the members of the Commission withdrew their report and Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev began very logically to prove that they must admit either that they had audited the accounts or that they had not done so , and to elaborate this dilemma .
for some of the districts the election was stor@@ my enough ; but for the Sel@@ ez@@ ensk district S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky was elected without opposition , and he gave a dinner party at his house that evening .
the old , for the most part , either wore old @@@ -@@ @ fashioned but@@ t@@ oned @@@ -@@ @ up uniforms of their class and carried s@@ words and hats , or wore the naval , cav@@ alry , or infantry uniforms to which each was individually entitled .
the young men wore long @@@ -@@ @ wai@@ sted loose uniforms wide across the shoulders with white wai@@ st@@ coats , or else were in uniforms with black col@@ lars embroi@@ dered with lau@@ rel leaves - the emblem of the Ministry of Justice .
some of the young ones , as Levin observed , belonged to the old party , and on the other hand some very aged no@@ bl@@ emen convers@@ ed in whis@@ pers with S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky and evidently were warm parti@@ sans of the new party .
he was now listening to S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky and H@@ ly@@ u@@ st@@ ov , the Mar@@ sh@@ al of another district , who also belonged to their party .
H@@ ly@@ u@@ st@@ ov was unwilling to go with the members for his district to invite S@@ net@@ kov to stand again for election . S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky was persuading him to do so and Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev approved of this .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , who had just had something to eat and drink , came toward them in his Cham@@ ber@@ lain 's uniform , wi@@ ping his mouth with his s@@ cent@@ ed and bor@@ dered lawn hand@@ ker@@ chief .
'@@ If , as in former elections , all the districts nominated the Prov@@ in@@ cial Mar@@ sh@@ al , he would be elected , receiving white balls from every one .
he could not hear distinctly because of the ster@@ tor@@ ous and ho@@ arse breathing of one no@@ bl@@ eman near him and the cre@@ aking of the st@@ out shoes of another .
he could hear only the distant soft voice of the Mar@@ sh@@ al , then the shr@@ ill voice of the ven@@ om@@ ous no@@ bl@@ eman , and then S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky 's voice .
the Act provided that in case of a difference of opinion the question should be ballo@@ ted upon .
at this several voices were heard , and the tall land@@ owner with the ring , growing more and more sp@@ it@@ eful , shouted louder and louder ; but it was impossible to make out what he was saying .
to free himself from this feeling he went , without waiting to hear the end of the discussion , into the refresh@@ ment room , where there was no one except the wa@@ it@@ ers at the buffet .
repl@@ ying to the no@@ bles , S@@ net@@ kov spoke of the confidence and affection of the Nob@@ ility , of which he was not worthy , his merit consisting only in his loyalty to the Nob@@ ility , to whom he had devoted twenty years of service .
this expression on the Mar@@ sh@@ al 's face touched Levin , particularly because , just the day before , he had been to his house about the wardship and had there seen him in all the dignity of a kind @@@ -@@ @ hearted family man .
'@@ i have brought one . I s@@ oused him , ' said the land@@ owner who had been to fetch him , approaching S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky . ' he 'll do . '
'@@ Yes , it 's a dirty business , say what you will , ' remarked an under@@ sized man with a fee@@ ble voice .
another group followed close on the heels of a no@@ bl@@ eman who was shouting loudly . he was one of those who had been made drunk .
'@@ i always advised Mary Sem@@ en@@ ovna to let her estate , because she will never make it pay , ' said a pleasant @@@ -@@ @ voiced land@@ owner with a grey mou@@ st@@ ache , wearing the uniform of Colonel of the former General Staff .
it can '@@ t be grown in a year , ' he remarked cauti@@ ously , immediately changing the subject . ' well , and how is your hus@@ band@@ ry getting on ? '
why don '@@ t we cut down our lim@@ es for b@@ ast ? ' said Levin , returning to the thought that had struck him .
'@@ We two have met for the first time since we were at your house , ' said the land@@ owner , ' and have indul@@ ged in a chat . '
I think I had the pleasure of meeting you ... at the Princess Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky 's ? ' said he , holding out his hand to Levin .
'@@ Yes , it does touch one to the quick , ' replied V@@ ron@@ sky , ' and having once taken the matter up , one wants to carry it through .
'@@ And how is it that you , living constantly in the country ; are not a Justice of the Peace ?
'@@ Because I consider that the magistr@@ acy is an idi@@ otic institution , ' mor@@ os@@ ely replied Levin , who had all the time been looking for an opportunity of speaking to V@@ ron@@ sky , to at@@ one for his ru@@ den@@ ess at their first encounter .
'@@ Oh , he is such a c@@ rank ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky with his smoo@@ th@@ est and most al@@ mon@@ dy smile . ' but come ! I think the ballot has begun ... '
but Count V@@ ron@@ sky ... I do not make a friend of him ; he invited me to dinner and I Sh@@ an '@@ t go ; but he is one of our party , so why make an enemy of him ?
'@@ There , you say it 's all tri@@ fling , but when you begin on it you make a mess of everything . '
the Mar@@ sh@@ al of the Province , though he felt in the air that there was a plot prepared against him , and though he had not been unanimously asked to stand , had still decided to do so .
having eaten a cut@@ let and beans , and talked with the old man about his former masters , Levin , not wishing to return to the hall where he had felt so out of his element , went up into the gallery .
the gallery was crowded with smar@@ tly @@@ -@@ @ dressed women who leaned over the bal@@ u@@ str@@ ade and tried not to miss a single word of what was being said below .
every one was talking about the elections and how tired out the Mar@@ sh@@ al was and how interesting the debates had been . in one group Levin heard them pra@@ ising his brother .
'@@ as candidate for the post of Prov@@ in@@ cial Mar@@ sh@@ al , Captain Eugene Ivan@@ ich A@@ pu@@ kh@@ tin will now be ballo@@ ted for . '
on the stairs he met a couple : a lady running up swiftly in her high @@@ -@@ @ he@@ eled shoes , and the Assistant Public Prosecutor .
'@@ i told you to let no one out ! ' he shouted to the door@@ keeper . ' I was letting people in , Your Excell@@ ency ! '
he was quite a new man in this circle of noble land@@ owners , but he evidently was a success ; and he was not mistaken in thinking that he had already gained influence among them .
V@@ ron@@ sky sat at the head of the table ; on his right was the young Governor , a General of the Emperor 's suite .
and therefore all that was honest , as he remarked , was on the side of to @@@ -@@ @ day 's success and triumph@@ ed in it .
S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky com@@ ically mim@@ icked the old Mar@@ sh@@ al 's t@@ ear@@ ful speech and , turning to Nev@@ ed@@ ovsky , remarked that His Excell@@ ency would have to adopt a different and more complex method of auditing the funds than tears !
this was uttered with the same pleasure with which a newly @@@ -@@ @ married woman is addressed as Mad@@ ame and called by her husband 's name .
but Dol@@ ly , on receiving the tel@@ eg@@ ram , only sigh@@ ed over the rouble it had cost , and understood that it had been sent toward the end of a dinner .
everything , including the splendid dinner and the wines - which did not come from Russian merchants but were imported ready @@@ -@@ @ bottled from abroad - was very distinguished , simple , and gay .
the company of twenty men had been selected by S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky from adherents of the new movement and from Liber@@ als , men who were also wit@@ ty and respectable .
I expected you the day before yesterday , and yesterday , and am now sending to find out where you are and what the matter is .
the feeling of injury had already passed , and she only feared the expression of his dis@@ pleasure .
the evening passed happily and cheer@@ fully in the company of the Princess Barbara , who complained to him that in his absence Anna had been taking mor@@ phia .
yes , you will come for a day and go away again , as men do ... '
she now distinctly realized the awakening of a new sense of ten@@ derness for the coming ( and for her to some extent already existing ) child , and she yielded with pleasure to that feeling .
the one advantage of this town @@@ -@@ @ life was that here they never quar@@ rel@@ led .
the old Princess , Mary Boris@@ ovna , Kit@@ ty 's god@@ mother , who had always been very fond of her , particularly wished to see her .
though Kit@@ ty was not going out anywhere because of her condition , yet she went with her father to see the vener@@ able old lady , and there met V@@ ron@@ sky .
she exchanged a few words with V@@ ron@@ sky , and even smiled at a joke he made about the elections , to which he allu@@ ded as ' our parliament . '
a stranger arrives , sits down , remains a while doing nothing , distur@@ bs them , up@@ sets himself , and goes away again . '
'@@ i did , but I always felt ashamed , and now I am so out of the habit of it that , seriously , I would rather go without dinner for two days than pay that call !
not once since our marriage have I said to myself that things might have been better than they are ... '
at the por@@ ch Kuz@@ ma , an old servant of his bachelor days , who was now managing the household in town , stopped Levin .
'@@ Kras@@ av@@ chik ' ( one of the pair of carriage horses brought from the country ) ' has been re @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ od but still goes lame , ' said he . ' what are your orders ? '
he wanted to arrange the matter as well and as cheaply as possible ; but it turned out that their own horses cost them more than hired ones would have done , and they hired horses as well .
on his way he thought no more about money , but considered how he could make the acquaintance of the Petersburg scholar , who was studying sociology , and how he would talk to him about his book .
'@@ Deci@@ dedly you are improving - quite a pleasure to see it , ' said Kat@@ av@@ asov as he welcomed Levin in the little drawing @@@ -@@ @ room . ' I heard the bell and thought " It 's impossible he can have come punc@@ tually .@@ ... "
Kat@@ av@@ asov in a few words told him the latest news , and , taking him into the study , introduced Levin to a tall , stur@@ dy , and very agre@@ eable @@@ -@@ @ looking man .
'@@ It is easy to be led astr@@ ay when drawing conclusions as to the general vocation of a people , ' said Met@@ rov , interrup@@ ting Levin . ' the condition of the lab@@ ou@@ rer will always depend on his relation to land and capital . '
this resolution was , in the opinion of some people , a dreadful one , while according to others it was very simple and just . the professors were divided into two camps .
at the table covered with a cloth at which Kat@@ av@@ asov and Met@@ rov took their seats six men were sitting , and one of them , with his head bent close over a manuscript , was reading something .
Levin took one of the vacant chairs which were standing round the table , and in a whis@@ per asked a student who was sitting there what was being read .
when the reader had finished , the chairman thanked him and read aloud some verses for the jubilee sent by the poet ment , adding a few words of thanks to the poet .
as Levin had already heard all that , he ha@@ st@@ ened to tell Met@@ rov that he regre@@ tted he was unable to accept his invitation , shook hands , and drove off to the L@@ v@@ ov@@ s ' .
L@@ vo@@ v , WHO W@@ AS married to Kit@@ ty 's sister Nat@@ aly , had passed all his life in the capitals and abroad , where he had been educated and where he had been in the diplomatic service .
his handsome , refined , and still young @@@ -@@ @ looking face , to which the cur@@ ly , glossy , silver hair gave a still more well @@@ -@@ @ bred appearance , lit up with a smile when he saw Levin .
even for the children 's lessons I often have to refresh my memory , or even simply to learn things .
I was just reading , ' and he showed Levin Bus@@ la@@ ev 's Gr@@ ammar which lay on the lec@@ tern . ' they expect M@@ isha to know this , and it is so difficult ...
Levin tried to explain that it is impossible to understand it and that it must just be learnt by heart ; but L@@ vo@@ v did not agree with him .
Levin had forgotten the commission he had been charged with and only remembered it when on his way to the ante @@@ -@@ @ room .
one was King Le@@ ar on the He@@ ath , a Fan@@ ta@@ sia , and the other was a qu@@ artet dedicated to the memory of B@@ ach .
wishing to clear up his own perpl@@ ex@@ ity by hearing other people 's impressions , Levin went to look for the experts , and was pleased to find a celebrated one chat@@ ting with his own acquaintance , P@@ est@@ sov .
'@@ You can '@@ t follow without it , ' said P@@ est@@ sov turning to Levin , as the man he had been talking to had gone away and he had no one else to talk to .
'@@ They do ; please walk in , ' said the hall @@@ -@@ @ porter , determin@@ edly helping him off with his over@@ coat .
as he entered the first drawing @@@ -@@ @ room he met in the doorway the Countess Bo@@ l , who with an anxious and stern expression was giving orders to a servant .
when she saw Levin she smiled and asked him into the next room , a smaller drawing @@@ -@@ @ room , wh@@ ence came the sound of voices .
when he had said enough and paused , the Colonel , who till then had kept silent , began also to talk about the opera and about the lighting of the opera @@@ -@@ @ house .
the hall @@@ -@@ @ porter as he helped him on with his over@@ coat asked where he was staying , and at once entered his address in a large well @@@ -@@ @ bound book .
this hall @@@ -@@ @ porter not only knew Levin but knew all his connections and relatives as well , and at once mentioned some of his intimate friends .
here and there he came across all sorts of people he knew : old and young , some whom he only just knew and some with whom he was intimate .
go to that table , and be quick and secure a seat , ' said the old Prince , and turning away he carefully took a plate of fish soup that was handed to him .
he always liked that good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured sp@@ end@@ thri@@ ft T@@ uro@@ v@@ tsin ; with him was associated the memory of his proposal to Kit@@ ty ; but to @@@ -@@ @ day , after all those strained intellectual conversations , T@@ uro@@ v@@ tsin 's good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured face was particularly welcome .
it might have been thought that from a score of different h@@ ors d '@@ oeu@@ v@@ res it would be possible to select one to any taste , but O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky ordered something special , and one of the li@@ ver@@ ied foot@@ men brought it at once .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky took a glass , and exchanging a look with a bal@@ d , red @@@ -@@ @ haired man with a mou@@ st@@ ache who sat at the other end of their table , smil@@ ingly nodded to him .
'@@ He has been congratulated ! ' remarked the Colonel . ' it 's the second time he 's won the Imperial prize . if only I had the luck at cards that he has with horses ! ...
'@@ Well , and how do you like our Temple of id@@ l@@ eness ? ' said the Prince , giving him his arm . ' come , let 's walk about a little . '
'@@ Will you come , Prince ? everything is ready , ' said one of his habitual partners , finding him there , and the Prince went away .
Levin sat down for a while and listened , but remembering all the conversations he had that day heard , he suddenly felt terribly bored .
T@@ uro@@ v@@ tsin , with a tan@@ k@@ ard of something to drink , was sitting on the high sofa in the billi@@ ard @@@ -@@ @ room , and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky was talking to V@@ ron@@ sky by the door in the far corner .
he was glad the hostility between V@@ ron@@ sky and himself was ended , and the impression of tranqu@@ ill@@ ity , decor@@ um , and pleasure did not leave him .
'@@ i think you see in every woman only a female , une cou@@ ve@@ use ! [ a bro@@ o@@ dy hen . ] necessarily occupied with children if at all ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
on the top landing a foot@@ man bowed to O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky as to some one he knew well , and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , asking who was with Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna , received the answer that it was Mr. Vor@@ ku@@ yev .
passing through a small dining @@@ -@@ @ room , pan@@ elled in dark wood , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky and Levin entered the study across the soft carpet . it was lit by a lamp with a large dark shade .
Levin fl@@ ushed , and to hide his confusion was about to ask her if it was long since she had seen Dol@@ ly , but at that instant Anna herself began to speak .
and her smile and glance told him that she was speaking for him alone , valu@@ ing his opinion and knowing in advance that they would understand one another .
she asked Levin and Vor@@ ku@@ yev to pass on into the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room , and herself remained behind to speak to her brother . ' about the divorce ?
'@@ To @@@ -@@ @ day again I did not go to the Court , but to @@@ -@@ @ day I really had no time . '
all the events had consisted of conversations : conversations to which he had listened or in which he had taken part .
the three sisters ' dinner @@@ -@@ @ party would have gone off very well , except that he did not come in as they expected and they all became dull . then the sisters left , and she remained alone .
Kit@@ ty 's eyes opened in a peculiar manner and fl@@ ashed at the mention of Anna 's name , but making an effort she hid her agitation and so deceived him .
when H@@ ER V@@ IS@@ IT@@ OR@@ S H@@ AD taken TH@@ E@@ IR LE@@ AV@@ E Anna did not sit down , but began pac@@ ing up and down the room .
and Steve says he can '@@ t go to see Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich ; and I can '@@ t write again .
she must let him see that she was dis@@ pleased that he had not returned when he had promised - dis@@ pleased , that should be all ; she would on no account show him her grief , and still less her self @@@ -@@ @ compassion .
what about the races ? you haven '@@ t told me about them , ' and she tried to hide her triumph at her victory , for the victory was hers after all .
but under the influence of wear@@ iness , a sle@@ e@@ pless night , and the wine he had drunk , he slept s@@ oundly and peacefully .
'@@ What ? has it begun ? has it ? ' he asked in a frightened voice . ' we must send ... ' And he began to dress hur@@ ri@@ edly .
at that instant he knew that neither his doubts nor the impossibility of believing with his reason - of which he was conscious - all prevented his appealing to God .
this was more than Levin could stand ; he resolutely s@@ nat@@ ched the bottle out of the man 's hands and rushed out at the big glass door .
the doctor was not up yet , and the foot@@ man , now busy putting down a carpet , refused to wake him .
'@@ Good morning ! ' said the doctor , holding out his hand and , as it seemed to Levin , te@@ asing him by his calm manner . ' Don '@@ t hurry !
you see you are inexperienced , I am sure I shall not be needed , but I promised , and if you like I will come .
'@@ i know , I know , ' he said with a smile . ' I am a family man myself .
did you read yesterday 's tel@@ eg@@ ram ? ' asked the doctor , chew@@ ing a piece of roll .
'@@ no , I can '@@ t stand it ! ' said Levin , jumping up . ' so you will come in a quarter of an hour ? '
he was surprised when Mary Vl@@ as@@ evna asked him to light a candle behind the partition , and he learnt that it was already five o 'clock in the evening .
Kit@@ ty 's burning face , worn with suffering , with a lock of hair cl@@ inging to her clam@@ my forehead , was turned toward him trying to catch his eye .
'@@ It 's all right , it 's all right ! all goes well ! ' Dol@@ ly called after him .
the terrible screaming did not cease , but grew yet more awful until , as if it had reached the utmost limit of horror , it suddenly ceased .
falling on his knees by her bed@@ side he held his wife 's hand to his lips , kis@@ sing it , and that hand , by a fee@@ ble movement of the fingers , replied to the kis@@ ses .
Don '@@ t be anxious , ' Levin heard Mary Vl@@ as@@ evna say , as she sl@@ apped the baby 's back with a shaking hand .
and amid the silence , as a positive answer to the mother 's question , a voice quite unlike all the restrained voices that had been speaking in the room made itself heard .
he felt as if he were on some un@@ attainable height , from which he pain@@ stak@@ ingly descended in order not to hurt the feelings of those with whom he was convers@@ ing .
he talked but never ceased thinking of his wife , of the details of her present condition , and of his son - to the idea of whose existence he pain@@ stak@@ ingly tried to accu@@ stom himself .
Levin , gaz@@ ing at this tiny pit@@ eous being , v@@ ain@@ ly searched his soul for some indications of pat@@ er@@ nal feeling .
and Mary Vl@@ as@@ evna held out to Levin on one hand ( the other merely supporting the n@@ ape of the sha@@ ky head ) this strange , lim@@ p , red creature , that hid its head in its sw@@ add@@ ling clothes .
smiling , and hardly able to keep back tears of ten@@ derness , Levin kis@@ sed his wife and qu@@ itted the dark@@ ened room .
two @@@ -@@ @ thirds of the money for the forest had already been spent , and by allowing a discount of ten per cent he had obtained from the merchant almost the whole of the last third .
sitting in K@@ aren@@ in 's study and listening to his article on ' The Ca@@ uses of the Bad State of Russian Finance , ' O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky only waited for him to conclude to speak about his own affairs and about Anna .
'@@ i consider , and I have written an article on the point , that the enormous salaries paid nowadays are a symptom of the false economic position of our administration . '
'@@ But I understood that Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna declined a divorce if I insisted on keeping my son .
'@@ For heaven 's sake don '@@ t exc@@ ite yourself , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , touching his brother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law 's knee . ' the matter is not closed .
and now in Moscow where every time she meets anyone it is like a knife in her heart , she has been living for six months every day expecting your decision .
'@@ i have never refused to do what is possible , but I want time to consider in how far what was promised is possible . '
v@@ ous prof@@ es@@ se@@ z d '@@ ê@@ tre un libr@@ e Pen@@ se@@ ur , [ You prof@@ ess to be a fre@@ e@@ thinker . ] but I , as a believer , in so important a matter C@@ AN@@ NOT act contrary to the Christian law . '
'@@ He was very ill after that unexpected interview with his mother , ' remarked K@@ aren@@ in . ' we even feared for his life .
but sensible treatment and sea @@@ -@@ @ bathing in the summer have restored his health , and now , on the doctor 's advice , I send him to school .
the influence of his school@@ fellows has really had a good effect on him , and he is quite well and learns well . '
during this year he had been sent to school , and had learned to know his school@@ mates and to like them .
when they rose in his memory he took pains to drive them away , considering them shameful and fit only for girls , but not for a boy and a ch@@ um .
he knew that his father and mother had had a quarrel which separated them ; knew that it was his fate to remain with his father , and he tried to accu@@ stom himself to that thought .
he had a wife and family with grown @@@ -@@ @ up sons who were pages at Court ; and another family , an illegitimate one , in which there were other children .
B@@ art@@ ny@@ ansky , who spent at least fifty thousand roubles a year at the rate he was living , had the day before made a notable remark to him on the point .
'@@ Never mind the name , I shoul@@ d@@ n '@@ t remember it ! ... But why do you want to mix in those railway concerns , with Jews ? ...
Pet@@ rovsky had run through five millions , continued living in just the same style , and even directed the Finance Department and received a salary of twenty thousand .
but the Princess My@@ ag@@ k@@ aya immediately interrupted him , as was her habit , and commenced telling her own tale .
now that he has got so ch@@ um@@ my with Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna and Land@@ au , every one says he is half @@@ -@@ @ wit@@ ted ; and I should be glad not to agree with everybody , but this time I can '@@ t help it . '
Land@@ au , you see , was a comm@@ is [ Shop @@@ -@@ @ assistant . ] in Paris and went to see a doctor .
he fell asleep in the doctor 's waiting @@@ -@@ @ room , and while asleep began giving advice to all the patients , and very strange advice too .
afterwards , Yury Mel@@ ed@@ insky 's wife ( the invalid 's wife , you know ) heard of that Land@@ au , and took him to see her husband .
it was still quite light out of doors , but in the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna 's small drawing @@@ -@@ @ room the blin@@ ds were down and the lamp ali@@ ght .
'@@ i introduced him to you as Land@@ au , ' she said softly , gl@@ ancing at the French@@ man and then back at O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , ' but really he is Count B@@ ez@@ zu@@ bov , as you probably know .
[ the friends of our friends are our friends . ] But to be a friend , one must enter into the state of the friend 's soul , and I fear you will not do so in relation to Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich .
won '@@ t you have some tea ? ' she said , indicating with her eyes the foot@@ man who was handing tea round on a tray .
'@@ Yes , a mis@@ fortune which has turned into a great blessing , because his heart became new and is filled with Him , ' she said , gl@@ ancing at O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky with lov@@ es@@ ick eyes .
'@@ To labour for God with works ; to save one 's soul by fasting , ' said the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna with fas@@ ti@@ dious disdain , ' those are the barbar@@ ous opinions of our monks ...
we are saved by faith , ' K@@ aren@@ in chim@@ ed in , showing his approval of her remark by a look .
well , and what happened ? she found this Friend , and now she thanks God for her child 's death .
'@@ no , evidently it will be better not to ask for anything to @@@ -@@ @ night , ' he reflected ; ' only let me get away from here without making a mess of things ! '
'@@ It will be dull for you , ' said the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna , turning to Land@@ au , ' as you don '@@ t understand English ; but it is quite short . '
listening to the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna and feeling the fine eyes , naive or ro@@ gu@@ ish - he did not know which - of Land@@ au fixed upon him , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky began to be conscious of a peculiar sort of heav@@ iness in his head .
K@@ aren@@ in rose , and though he tried to be cautious he caught against the table . he went up to the French@@ man and placed his hand in his .
she wrote that she greatly wished to finish the conversation they had begun , and asked him to call next day .
for a long time she could not believe that the dispute had begun from a perfectly in@@ offensive conversation about a matter that did not touch the heart of either .
he spoke dis@@ respec@@ tfully of the education of women in general , and said that Hann@@ ah , her little English prote@@ g@@ é@@ e , did not at all need to know physics .
'@@ i know what he wanted to say : he wanted to say that it is un@@ natural not to love one 's own daughter and yet to love another 's child .
no , he must be in love with some other woman ; it can '@@ t be anything else . '
then , realizing that in her attempt to quiet herself she had again completed the circle she had already gone round so often , and had returned to her former cause of irritation , she was horror @@@ -@@ @ struck at herself .
yes , now , as soon as he comes back , I will tell him I was to blame , though in fact I was not , and we will go away ! '
and not to continue thinking , and not to yield to irritation , she rang and ordered her tr@@ unks to be brought , to pack their things for the country .
when he returned she told him , partly repeating words she had prepared , how she had spent the day and her plans for the move to the country .
'@@ Do you know , it came to me almost like an inspiration ? ' said she . ' why must we wait here for the divorce ?
I don '@@ t want to hope , I don '@@ t want to hear anything about the divorce .
it was no longer the Queen of Sweden 's instruc@@ tress but the Princess Sor@@ ok@@ ina who lived in the country near Moscow with the Countess V@@ ron@@ skaya who presented herself to Anna 's imagination .
'@@ i will go to mam@@ an at once . she can send me the money through E@@ gor@@ ov and I shall be ready to go to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row , ' said he .
'@@ i did not wish to show it you , because Steve has a passion for tele@@ graph@@ ing . what is the use of tele@@ graph@@ ing when nothing has been settled ? '
Anna took the tel@@ eg@@ ram with trembling hands and saw exactly what V@@ ron@@ sky had said , but at the end were added the words : ' little hope , but I 'll do everything possible and impossible . '
the possibility of having children had long been a subject of dispute , and it irrit@@ ated her .
'@@ It is perfectly indifferent to me what your mother thinks and whom she wishes to marry you to , ' she went on , putting down her cup with a trembling hand .
and believe me , a hear@@ tless woman , be she old or young , your mother or a stranger , does not interest me , and I don '@@ t want to have anything to do with her . '
'@@ Oh , I don '@@ t know . I don '@@ t think I shall get it all , and on Wednesday I must go .
but , you see , some men find it possible to sit down to cards and yet to be able always to leave when the time comes for an as@@ sig@@ nation !
now I can engage in love @@@ -@@ @ making , but always so as not to be late for cards in the evening .
[ so much the worse for her . ] But , as he was going out , he thought she said something , and suddenly his heart ached with pity for her .
he even wished to stop and say a comfor@@ ting word to her , but his legs carried him out of the room before he had thought of anything to say .
all the cru@@ ell@@ est words that a coarse man could say he , in her imagination , said to her , and she did not forgive him for them any more than if he had really said them .
and he loves me ; All this has been , but will pass , ' she said , feeling that tears of joy at this return to life were running down her cheeks .
he could still call her back , but she reached the door and he remained silent , and only the ru@@ st@@ le of the paper as he turned a page was heard .
al@@ armed by the des@@ pairing look with which she had said these words , he jumped up , inten@@ ding to run after her , but , recoll@@ ecting himself , he sat down again , tightly cl@@ en@@ ching his teeth and fro@@ w@@ ning .
she went back to the window and saw him take the gloves without looking , and , having touched the co@@ ach@@ man 's back with his hand , say something to him .
the little girl , sitting at the table , persistently and firmly ham@@ mer@@ ed on it with the stop@@ per of a bottle , gaz@@ ing bl@@ ank@@ ly at her mother with her two black @@@ -@@ @ cur@@ ran@@ ts of eyes .
if I don '@@ t believe him , there is only one way left for me ... and I don '@@ t want that . '
'@@ Ann@@ ush@@ ka , my dear ! what am I to do ? ' mut@@ tered Anna so@@ b@@ bing , as she sank hel@@ pl@@ essly into an arm @@@ -@@ @ chair .
that same Kit@@ ty with whom V@@ ron@@ sky was in love , ' thought Anna . ' she whom he remembered aff@@ ection@@ ately .
Dol@@ ly went out alone to meet the visitor who at that moment had come to interrupt their talk .
but he has not refused ; on the contrary , Steve is hopeful , ' added Dol@@ ly , pa@@ using at the door .
'@@ What does it mean ? Kit@@ ty considers it humiliating to meet me ! ' thought Anna when she was left alone .
having mu@@ stered up her courage , Kit@@ ty came in and , bl@@ ushing , went up to Anna and held out her hand .
to her former tor@@ ments was now added a feeling of being aff@@ ron@@ ted and repudi@@ ated , of which she had been clearly sensible during the meeting with Kit@@ ty .
she gave the order to harness another pair of horses , and busi@@ ed herself packing her hand@@ bag with things necessary for a few days .
Ann@@ ush@@ ka , who came out with Anna 's things , and Peter , who put them into the carriage , and the co@@ ach@@ man , who was evidently dissatisfied , were all objec@@ tionable to her and irrit@@ ated her by their words and movements .
gl@@ ancing in the direction in which Peter was looking she saw a work@@ man , nearly dead @@@ -@@ @ drunk , with his head sw@@ aying about , who was being led off somewhere by a policeman .
as she moved among the crowd toward the first @@@ -@@ @ class waiting @@@ -@@ @ room she gradually recalled all the details of her position and the resolutions between which she vac@@ ill@@ ated .
Peter with a stupid smile raised his gold @@@ -@@ @ bra@@ ided hat to take leave of her ; an in@@ sol@@ ent guard s@@ lam@@ med the door to and drew the lat@@ ch .
some one from there was here just now , to meet the Princess Sor@@ ok@@ ina and her daughter .
gaz@@ ing into her face and laughing and shouting un@@ naturally they again passed by .
some ladies and children , who had come to meet a spectac@@ led gentleman and were laughing and talking nois@@ ily , became silent and gaz@@ ed at her as she passed them .
the platform shook , and it seemed to her as if she were again in the tram .
it was already the middle of the hot summer , but Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev was only now preparing to leave Moscow .
his book , the result of six years ' labour , entitled , An At@@ temp@@ t to Review the F@@ ound@@ ations and Forms of Government of Europe and Russia , had been finished a year ago .
the book had been issued last year after careful revision , and had been sent out to the book@@ sellers .
among the people to whom he belonged , nothing was written or talked about at that time except the Serbian war .
the massacre of our co @@@ -@@ @ religi@@ onists and brother Slavs ev@@ oked sympathy for the suffer@@ ers and indignation against their op@@ pres@@ sors .
and the hero@@ ism of the Serbs and Montenegr@@ ins , fighting for a great cause , aroused in the whole nation a desire to help their brothers not only with words but by deeds .
Kat@@ av@@ asov , who had promised Levin to visit him , and had long been meaning to keep that promise , accompanied Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev .
I said so ! ' the lady said joy@@ fully . ' and is@@ n '@@ t it true that about a million roubles have been collected ? '
they were talking of the latest tel@@ eg@@ ram , confirming the report that for three consecutive days the Turks had been beaten at all points and were in flight , and that a decisive battle was expected next day .
having obtained such details as the Princess could give about the young peti@@ tion@@ er , Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev went into the first @@@ -@@ @ class waiting @@@ -@@ @ room , wrote a note to the person on whom the decision depended , and gave it to the Princess .
'@@ Do you know that the well @@@ -@@ @ known Count V@@ ron@@ sky is going by this train ? ' remarked the Princess with a triumph@@ ant and significant smile , when Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev had found her again and given her the note .
every one shouted ' Z@@ hi@@ vio ! ' and a fresh crowd surged into the refresh@@ ment @@@ -@@ @ room , nearly knocking the Princess off her feet .
however , tell her , if you 'll be so kind , that I am appointed Member of the Committee of the Joint ...
'@@ i can '@@ t look calmly at those collecting @@@ -@@ @ boxes while I have any money , ' he remarked . ' and what a tel@@ eg@@ ram that was to @@@ -@@ @ day !
'@@ There he is ! ' said the Princess , pointing to V@@ ron@@ sky who , in a long over@@ coat and a black broad @@@ -@@ @ bri@@ m@@ med hat , was passing with his mother on his arm .
on the platform ' God save the Tsar ' was struck up , followed by ' hur@@ rah ' and ' zhi@@ vio ' !
one of the Volun@@ te@@ ers , a tall , hollow @@@ -@@ @ ch@@ ested , very young man , was b@@ owing in a specially noticeable way , wav@@ ing over his head a felt hat and a bou@@ quet .
from behind him two officers and an elderly man with a large beard and a gre@@ asy cap thrust their heads out , and also bowed .
having taken LE@@ AV@@ E OF THE Princess , Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev with Kat@@ av@@ asov , who had joined him , entered the very crowded carriage , and the train started .
opposite him sat an officer , no longer young , wearing a military jacket of the Austrian Guards .
getting into conversation with the young man , Kat@@ av@@ asov learnt that he had been a rich Moscow merchant but had run through a large fortune before he was twenty @@@ -@@ @ two .
he was a modest , quiet man , who evidently deferred to the knowledge of the retired Gu@@ ard@@ sman and to the heroic self @@@ -@@ @ sacrifice of the merchant and did not talk at all about himself .
'@@ i did not serve in the artillery long . I am a retired Cad@@ et , ' he said , and began to explain why he had not passed the examination for a commission .
all this put together produced on Kat@@ av@@ asov a dis@@ agre@@ eable impression , and when the Volun@@ te@@ ers got out at a station to have a drink he wished to verify this un@@ favourable impression by a talk with somebody .
one of the passengers , an old man in a military over@@ coat , had been listening all the time to Kat@@ av@@ asov 's conversation with the Volun@@ te@@ ers . when they were left alone together Kat@@ av@@ asov addressed him .
'@@ What a variety there is in the positions of all these men who are going there ! ' Kat@@ av@@ asov remarked vagu@@ ely , wishing to express his own opinion but at the same time to draw the old man .
we took away everything that he could kill himself with . we lived on the ground floor , but one could not tell what he might do .
in the evening I had only just gone to my room when my Mary told me that at the station a lady had thrown herself under a train .
'@@ Oh no ! ' replied V@@ ron@@ sky , as if it cost him an effort to understand . ' if you don '@@ t mind , let us walk up and down .
I am glad that there is something for which I can lay down the life which I not only do not want , but of which I am sick !
and having spoken about the proposed pro@@ clamation of Milan as King and of the immense results this might have , they returned to their respective carriages after the second bell had already sounded .
'A@@ ren '@@ t you ashamed of yourself for not letting us know ? ' she said , holding out her hand to him and offering her forehead for a kiss .
it was not a mere guess - the bond between herself and the baby had not yet been sever@@ ed - and she knew surely by the flow of milk within herself that he was wanting food .
'@@ But one must , you know , ma '@@ am , ' said Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na , who was almost always in the nur@@ sery . ' he must be properly ti@@ died up !
'@@ Well , all right , all right ! we shall see , ' Kit@@ ty whispered . ' but now go away , he is falling asleep . '
only now and then the baby , continuing his business , lifted his long cur@@ ved l@@ ashes and looked at his mother with mo@@ ist eyes that seemed black in the dim light .
if I don '@@ t see to it , Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na will give Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich used bed @@@ -@@ @ linen ! ' and the very thought of this sent the blood into Kit@@ ty 's face .
Dol@@ ly was in despair ; she hated her husband , desp@@ ised him , p@@ iti@@ ed him , made up her mind to divorce him and to refuse ; but ended by con@@ sent@@ ing to sell part of her estate .
and he not only failed to find in the whole arsenal of his convictions any kind of answer , but he could not even find anything resembling an answer .
he was in the position of a man seeking for food in a to@@ y@@ shop or at a gun@@ sm@@ ith 's .
involun@@ tarily and unconsciously , in every book , in every conversation , and in every person he met , he now sought for their relation to those questions and for a solution to them .
but that moment had passed , and he could not al@@ lot any place in his life to the state of mind he had then experienced .
Levin read the second volume of them , and in spite of its pol@@ em@@ ical , polished , and wit@@ ty style , which at first rep@@ elled him , he was struck by its teaching about the Church .
he was struck by the thought that it is not given to isolated man to attain divine truth , but that it is given to a community united by love - the Church .
'@@ in an infinity of time , and in infinity of matter , in infinite space , a bubble , a bubble organism , separates itself , and that bubble maintains itself a@@ while and then bursts , and that bubble is - I ! '
this was a dist@@ ressing false@@ hood , but it was the sole and last result of centuries and the age @@@ -@@ @ long labour of human thought in that direction .
an end had to be put to that dependence on an evil power ; and there was one means - death .
he might sell straw to the peasants in a time of shortage , though he felt sorry for them ; but an inn or a public @@@ -@@ @ house , although it brought in a revenue , must be done away with .
he must lend money to Peter to liberate him from the usur@@ ers to whom he was paying ten per cent@@ . a month ; but he must neither reduce or postpone the payments of rent by the peasants who were in default .
the ste@@ ward must not be exc@@ used when the small me@@ adow was not m@@ own and the grass was wasted ; but grass must not be m@@ own on the eighty des@@ y@@ at@@ inas which had been planted with young trees .
Levin got into conversation with Theodore about that land , and asked whether Plato , a well @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ do@@ . and worthy peasant of that village , would not rent that land next year .
'@@ the rent is too high , Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich , ' answered Theodore , picking out the ears of ry@@ e from the front of his damp shirt .
and having understood them , did I doubt their justice ? did I find them stupid , vague , or in@@ exact ?
and then that same Theodore says that it is wrong to live for one 's belly , and that we must live for Truth , for God , and at the first hint I understand him !
a physical miracle would have tempted me . but here is a miracle , the one possible , everlasting miracle , all around me , and I did not notice it !
he was breath@@ less with excitement and , incapable of going further , he turned from the road into the wood and sat down on the un@@ cut grass in the shade of the as@@ pens .
and I was surprised that , in spite of the greatest effort of thought on that path , the meaning of life , the meaning of my impulses and my aspirations , was not revealed to me .
now it was clear to him that he was only able to live , thanks to the beliefs in which he had been brought up .
'@@ What should I have been and how should I have lived my life , if I had not had those beliefs , and had not known that one must live for God , and not for one 's own needs ?
left by themselves , the children had started cooking r@@ asp@@ berries over a candle , and pouring jets of milk into their mouths .
now we 've thought of putting r@@ asp@@ berries in a cup and cooking them over a candle , and of pouring milk into each other 's mouths like foun@@ tains .
'@@ Don '@@ t we , and did@@ n '@@ t I , do just the same , when intellectually I sought for the meaning of the forces of nature and the purpose of human life ? ' he went on thinking .
'@@ Yes , what I know , I know not by my reason but because it has been given to me , revealed to me , and I know it in my heart by faith in the chief thing which the Church pro@@ claims .
and it now seemed to him that there was not one of the dog@@ mas of the Church which could disturb the principal thing - faith in God , in goodness , as the sole vocation of man .
as if just awakened from a dream , it was long before he could collect his thoughts .
Kat@@ av@@ asov was very fond of talking about philosophy , having a conception of it which he had acquired from natur@@ alists who had never studied it , and in Moscow Levin had lat@@ terly had many disputes with him .
Levin always advised his wife not to take the child into the wood , considering it dangerous , and this news was dis@@ agre@@ eable to him .
'@@ She w@@ and@@ ers about with him from place to place , ' said the old Prince with a smile . ' I advised her to try taking him to the ice @@@ -@@ @ cellar ! '
'@@ Well , I have finally convinced myself that I Sh@@ an '@@ t find solutions of the questions I am concerned about in him , or in people of his kind .
trying to make as few br@@ us@@ que movements as possible and listening to the bees that flew past him more and more often , he went along the path to the hu@@ t .
on the other side of the fence an old man was making a hoo@@ p and did not notice Levin , who stopped in the middle of the api@@ ary without calling him .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev did not reply , but with the blunt side of a knife carefully extracted from a bowl in which lay a wedge of white honey@@ comb a live bee that had stuck in the running honey .
in heaven 's name , Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich , explain to me where all these Volun@@ te@@ ers are going and whom they are fighting , ' said the old Prince , evidently continuing a conversation that had been started during Levin 's absence .
'@@ the Turks ! ' answered Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , quietly smiling , having extracted the bee which , black with honey , moved its legs hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ly@@ . as he shifted it from the knife to a firm asp@@ en leaf .
'@@ But the Prince is not talking of help , ' inter@@ posed Levin , taking his father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law 's side , ' but of war !
'@@ Per@@ haps , ' said Levin ev@@ asi@@ vely , ' but I don '@@ t see it . I myself am one of the people , and I don '@@ t feel it . '
shall I bring some more bread and give the l@@ addi@@ e a bit ? ' he asked Dol@@ ly , pointing to G@@ ris@@ ha , who was finishing his cr@@ ust .
the most divergent parties in the intellectual world , previously so hostile to one another , have all merged into one .
'@@ Yes , he asked me to tell Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na that he has got the post , ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev dis@@ cont@@ ent@@ edly , considering that what the Prince was saying was not to the point .
it has been explained to me : as soon as there is a war their revenue is doubled .
how can they help considering that the fate of the people and the Slavs - and all the rest of it ? '
he who pre@@ aches war - off with him in a special legi@@ on to the assault , to the attack , in front of everybody else ! " -@@ '
the unanimous and complete expression of public opinion is a service rendered by the Press , and is also a grati@@ fying phenomenon .
Levin fl@@ ushed with anno@@ y@@ ance , not at being beaten , but because he had not ref@@ rained from the dispute .
he saw that it was not possible to convince his brother and Kat@@ av@@ asov , and still less did he see any possibility of himself agreeing with them .
the PR@@ IN@@ CE AND KO@@ Z@@ NY@@ SH@@ E@@ V GO@@ T IN@@ TO THE TRA@@ P and drove off ; the rest of the party , ha@@ st@@ ening their steps , went home on foot .
when they were still about two hundred p@@ aces from the house the wind had already risen , so that at any moment a down@@ pour might be expected .
a white curtain of pouring rain was already descending over the distant wood and half the neighbouring field , and was advancing rapidly toward the K@@ olo@@ k .
they were at the other end of the wood , under an old lime tree , and were calling him .
after the rain it was too wet to go out walking , besides which the thunder @@@ -@@ @ clouds had not cleared from the horizon , and , now here now there , passed th@@ undering and dark@@ ening along the borders of the sky .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev too was in good spirits and at tea , led on by his brother , exp@@ ounded his views of the future of the Eastern question , and did it so simply and well that every one listened attentively .
he did not now recall , as he had done before , the whole course of his thoughts ( he did not now need to ) .
Kit@@ ty was standing , with her sle@@ eves rolled up , beside the bath in which the baby was spl@@ ashing about , and hearing her husband 's step she turned her face toward him , bec@@ k@@ oning him with a smile .
with one hand supporting the head of the pl@@ ump kicking baby who floated on his back , with the other she squeezed the water from a spon@@ ge over him , regularly exer@@ ting the muscles of her arm .
Levin listened to the rhyth@@ m@@ ical dri@@ pping of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps from the lime trees in the garden , and looked at a familiar triangular const@@ ellation and at the Mil@@ ky Way which with its branches inter@@ sec@@ ted it .
by the light of that flash she saw the whole of his face and , noticing that he was calm and happy , she smiled at him .
'@@ This new feeling has not changed me , has not rendered me happy , nor suddenly illuminated me as I dream@@ t it would , but is just like my feeling for my son .
