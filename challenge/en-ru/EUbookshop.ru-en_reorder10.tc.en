the Tempus Programme is the trans @-@ European cooperation scheme for higher education . adopted by the Council of Ministers of the European Union ( EU ) on 7 May 1990 , the programme was addressed to the central and eastern European countries ( Tempus Phare ) .
bearing in mind the long @-@ term objective and in line with the bottom @-@ up approach , consortia themselves will define the project specific ( or short @-@ term ) objective .
the above factors ( the project logic ) should be decided and agreed upon by all consortium members . this will help you to reach a common understanding of the project objective and expected outcomes or results .
as a sign of their commitment to trans @-@ European cooperation , the higher education institutions involved in Tempus projects are expected to invest a part of their own staff resources in the fulfilment of other types of tasks .
the European Training Foundation is an agency of the European Union which works in the field of vocational education and training in Central and Eastern Europe , the New Independent States , Mongolia and the non @-@ EU Mediterranean countries and territories .

Russia and the EU Member States - Statistical comparison 1990 ­ 96 o ho is a joint publication of Goskomstat of Russia and Eurostat , the Statistical Office of the European Communities .
I am going to speak about the environment in which statistical computing is finding itself in the European Union and where it will find itself in the next ten years within the information society .
• • other time versions of " the same " statistical data - comparability in time. other statistical data , from other statistical surveys , or from other countries / regions - comparability in space ;
the second type of risk concerns theft of your individual data , and here I am basing my remarks on what Mr Franchet said yesterday evening on the anxiety of the European countries to protect people 's private lives .
on the base of the new techniques we created the Publishing section which has the responsibility to define the forms and standards of the publications and to take over step by step the editorial activity from the subject @-@ matter departments .
the CASE tool is defined as the combination of a graphics interface , dictionary , generator , project management and other tools which aid the developers in the construction and maintenance of high quality systems , all within the framework of a structured methodology .
the tools to achieve this is the combination of automated data collection techniques , to capture at a lower cost to the enterprises better business figures , and the integration of a business statistics environment within the overall " information administrative system " of the enterprise .
the objective is to study , in the various countries of the Community and the EFTA countries , the state of the art in the area of automated data collection in general , and particularly in electronic questionnaire .
strategy for statistical computing for the countries of the CIS Proceedings of the seminar for the heads of the statistical services of the Commonwealth of indepen ­ dent States - Luxembourg , 4 to 8 July 1994
the Programme was able to do this since 1994 was the first year that a significant number of projects were under implementation or reached completion and it was therefore possible to begin a process of monitoring and evaluating the success of projects .
teams of monitors made up of independent experts from both the European Community and the relevant partner country have been assessing the design and results of the projects as well as their relevance to the needs of the partner countries .
these changes , and TADS ' operations in general , were presented in a series of high @-@ level meetings between the Parliament and the Commission , backed by an exchange of extensive Information .
in its first five years of operation , 1991 -1995 , Tacis has committed ECU 2,268 million to launch more than 2,200 projects .
the customer structure analysis ( ABC analysis ) uses the following potential criteria : • current sales volume • size of orders • combination of size and frequency of orders • level of competition for the customer • potential sales volume • frequency of orders • profitability / ability to pay

dairy farms have to effect a complete reorganisation at each step of the milk production chain , with a view to making it more profitable , that is more efficient and more produc ­ tive .
they are based on improved management and feeding of the cattle , in particu ­ Lar on the basis of forage @-@ based feeding , as a low cost substitute for concentrates that are both very expensive and difficult to obtain .
dairy farming is practically non @-@ existent among private farmers because of the poor prof ­ itability of the activity : few have been motivated to start this type of farming and most of those who set up faced serious difficulties .
the large size of the herds , the lack of training or profit @-@ sharing incentives for the workers have not favoured the search for solutions to improve the productivity and profitability of the dairy farms .
due to the poor quality of the grazing pasture ( 300 to 600 FULVha . / year ) , where it exists , it is necessary to provide the animals with large quantities of machine harvested fodder crops .
milk can only be produced on the basis of the protein and cereal intake ( naturally poor in protein ) and the cows ' own bodily reserves ( which are often already reduced at the start of the winter ) .
in the St @-@ Petersburg region , collec ­ tive farms are relatively small ( 2,000 to 4,000 ha in total ) but they are often very stretched out , owing to the lakes and forests and this does not allow efficient exploita ­ tion of forage areas .
this region enjoys a climate that is well suited to dairy farming ; the soils are less rich than those found in Kirovograd and Kursk but the rainfall here is more abundant ( with 600 to 800 mm ) .
efficient use of the grazing will also guarantee the durability of the temporary pasture over a period of 15 @-@ 20 years while in the converse situation it would not last more than a year .
in December 1994 , this herd was fed at will ( 10 kg / day ) and exclu ­ sively on the silage of field peas @-@ fodder oats and with beets .
during summer , the cows are divided into three groups : one remains on the farm , and each of the other two herds leave for the fens situated 10 km away from the complex and at a distance of 8 km apart from each other .
forage has a filling effect , measured by the amount of dry matter in the rumen , increasing simultaneously with the amount of lignified fibres which are hard for the animal to chew .
Ingestibility of voluminous feeds ( I ) : amount of the feed ( according to its dry matter content ) , which is fed to animals , if this and only this feed is given without any limits .
figure 5 : scheme of good quality fodder digestion ( digestability of organic matters 70 % ) and its distribution between main sections of digestion ( represented with their epithelium ) : destination of main components , formation & destination of microbe corps , final products Lignified tissues
the cow then draws on its ( decreasing ) bodily reserves , in a first stage to continue producing , losing weight and secondly to stay alive ( early drying up , embryo loss , sterility ) .
in Its first five years of operation , 1991 -1995 , Tacis has committed ECU 2,268 million to launch more than 2,200 projects .
the result was , for the first time , a rational and scientific market analysis that would enable MIPO to make key decisions on the marketing mix : the Products , the Price , Place ( distribution ) , and Promotion of products .
the restructuring of the Post Office business aimed at achieving a greater focus on cus ­ tomer satisfaction , a greater capability for speedy decision @-@ making , and to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the administrative sections .
the initial track and trace system was subsequently replaced by a combined manage ­ ment information and track and trace system developed by the Information Technology Department of the Moscow International Post Office , with advice from the Tacis consul ­ tants .
flexibility to develop a work programme to meet the real business needs and the ability to draw on additional specialists is considered to have made a major impact on the suc ­ cess of the project .
the course starts with a trainer @-@ centred approach but quickly moves to be a trainee @-@ centred workshop con ­ centrating on practical hands @-@ on experience in the safety of the training environment .
• The organisation 's vision , direction and goals • Cascading goals into tasks • Job purpose statements • Key result areas • Targets and standards • Writing measurable standards • Performance reviews • The team and the individual
TACIS does this by providing grant finance for know @-@ how to support the process of transformation to market economies and democratic societies .
the net profit figure for both products is an unsatisfactory basis for product range decisions : - The actual division of say , R & D expenses between A and Β is unlikely to be reflected in their share of direct labour cost .
they are the very backbone of many economies , as is vividly demonstrated by Germany 's example . according to a recent study ( mittelstand : NIE war er so wertvoll , 1997 ) , 99.6 % of all 2.1 million German enterprises are SMEs1 .
► Medium and long @-@ term loans The banker will wish to know the details of these loans , that is the amount , when they are due for repayment , and whether they are secured or unsecured .
all fields to be cropped with sugar beet should be examined for compaction in the previ ­ OUs crop by digging Inspection pits and examining rooting systems , comparing areas of good and poor growth .
whilst some of this was due to poor drill per ­ formance or lack of attention to drill settings , often the problem was the seed itself , being poorly graded and presented .
when the rate at which water is extracted from the soil by beet plants and the Atmos ­ phere ( évapotranspiration ) exceeds the rate at which plants can absorb water from the soil , water stress occurs , resulting in wilting and slowing down of crop growth .
investment in irrigation equipment may not be justified for the beet crop alone , but , if it exists already , then its use on the beet crop will be well worthwhile .
in its first four years of operation , 1991 -1994 , Tacis has committed ECU 1,757 million to launch more than 2,000 projects .
this meant that the private bakery would address a demand already being met by the Industrial bakery , at least for traditional products . • The industrial bakery was not in a position to rapidly improve the freshness of its products .
each time a product is sold , part of the pro ­ ceeds go to pay for the indirect costs of the business : this part , called the gross margin is equal to the selling price minus the direct costs .
should the ECO not meet its payment obligations ( taking into account specific contractual issues ) , the distributor can cut off the electricity supply to the whole of the ECO region .
in its first four years of operation , 1991 -1994 , Tacis has committed ECU 1,757 million to launch more than 2,000 projects .
one possible source of funding for the implementation of projects requiring capital investments may be grants from international donor agencies such as the World Bank or the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) .
the laboratory also offers services to those outside the market who wish to obtain a health quality certificate and stamp for carcasses that will then be sold from other locations in the region .
in all cases , the category of goods Intended to be sold by the wholesalers is inserted in the lease agreement [ the statement " Fresh fruit and vegetables , " or " Dry groceries " etc . ] .
to ensure that an efficient flow of goods is achieved and that safety is maintained in the market , it is important to separate the action of re @-@ stocking pitches from the selling activity .
at certain stages of the market 's development , up to 70 % of participating wholesalers were newly @-@ formed businesses using the market opportunity to secure a foothold on the first rung of an entrepreneurial ladder .
however , difficulties can arise with the appointment of the market management , as they will find it difficult to balance the needs of investors with those of the municipality representing the needs of the community as a whole .
without positive benefit to the users , the market will become less attractive to the food sector , will run the risk of poor returns , and , at worst , will eventually have to close down .
these who have already copied the market in some way have found the Togliatti costs to be a good guide , especially at the stage of securing municipal funds and putting the building work out to tender .
it is for the leaders of subsequent market schemes to decide for them selves the driving forces in their own market , and to ensure that the people around them share in that vision .
such a simple distinction as this often becomes a problem if each company does not communi ­ Cate its own Intentions clearly or does not try to find out what the other company 's inten ­ tions are .
again , this is because the lender wants to ensure that the financial state of the tar ­ get company does not deteriorate rapidly after the target company has the lender 's money .
it ¡ s probably fair to say that most breaches of obligations and non @-@ payment of small debts are dealt with by the aggrieved company simply " writing off " the matter to experience .
we , here in this strange East / West interface of Berlin and Potsdam , have noticed that there are some people who even feel threatened by the ending of the separation between East and West .
it is the aim of this conference to high ­ light the possibilities for , and limits to , East ­ West exchange programmes and to promote encounters and cooperation among young people of all European coun ­ tries .
also , as a community of Western states we are charged with strengthening , within the framework of the EC and the Council of Euro pe , our bilateral as well as multilateral cooperation with our Central and Eastern European neighbours .
the development of European youth encounter programmes by Alexandros Tsolakis , Task Force Human Resources , Education , Training and Youth of the Commission of the European Communities , Head of the Youth Department
finally , it was only in 1985 that the European Council adopted the People 's Europe conclusions recommending that youth exchanges within the community be promoted and a fully ­ fledged network of exchanges within and between the Member States set up .
not all the youth leaders have experience of exchanges ; some do not know , or are not very familiar with , the countries with which they wish to organize the exchanges ; others have no exchange partners .
the BDY has taken up a position in the political centre and its chairman , Ivan Atanassov , founded the daily news ­ paper , " Fax , " which was , however , only shortlived .
furthermore , we are also trying to render assistance in order to overcome the lack of opportunities for young people to take part in international life by way of personal contacts and to contribute to international understanding .
however , it should be noted that since the fall of the totali ­ TArian regime , opportunities for young people , especially in this particular area , have mar ­ kedly improved .
in the Czech Republic , international contacts between children and young people have been implemented in the framework of government programmes for the support and pro ­ tection of the younger generation since 1991 .
it also includes support for youth exchanges , with priority being placed on such activities and projects as are carried out on the basis of inter ­ national agreements , with the main emphasis on getting to know the different peoples and cultures in Europe .
a Youth Card Association was established in order to unite and reconcile , as an independent legal entity , the individual interests of young people , the interests of organized youth and the interests of the state organs in pro ­ moting young people 's mobility .
this increase in volume , combined with the changes in political conditions , has altered the aims of the exchanges and many obstacles in the way of technical and professional co ­ operation , such as the Cocom list , have been abolished .
the knock @-@ on effect , which we believe the meeting will produce in terms of improving the situation of youth , should serve as a positive point of reference for similar initiatives in the same field and with the same priorities .
although the economy is in a transitional period , and the financial situation is difficult , one must nonetheless create propitious conditions for young people 's development : they are , after all , society 's future .
the umbrella organization of Luxemburg 's youth associations , the Conference Generale de la Jeunesse Luxembourgeoise , is planning to increase its cooperation with Central and Eastern Europe as a joint effort with its partner organizations in the other Benelux countries .
parallel to this , a transformation of the traditional welfare organizations to fully professiona ­ lized institutions took place , and with it , the growth of educational institutions for the training of professional social workers .
a main characteristic of programme @-@ based local youth policy is that it re @-@ establishes the responsibility of the local government , and through this it redefines the blurred relations between NGO 's and the. local government .
• Using budget allocations to give support solely to the programmes of non ­ political youth associations and foundations , while at the same time ensuring the possibility of co ­ operation with the youth organizations of political parties .
the Government of the Russian Federation has prepared a decree on the organization of the summer recreation programme in 1993 , and work is proceeding on the reorganization of the Orlyonok and Okean national children 's holiday centres .
at the same time , however , the possibilities for them to develop this experience , to satisfy their vital interests and requirements , which are necessary in order to support a family , do not exist .
when there is no real mechanism for the state to support its youth , a constant decline in living standards of the young people occurs , which is reflected through the level of their self ­ appraisal .
under modern conditions , especially in cities , the fact that several fami ­ lies live together in one flat more frequently becomes a source of social and psychological tension , and favours neither stability of marriage nor an increase in the birth rate .
as before , an absolute majority of the young PEO ­ PLE questioned ( 80 per cent ) support actions directed toward the building up of an indepen ­ dent Ukrainian State .
however , under conditions of economic destabilization , galloping inflation and further impoverishment of a considerable part of the population , the political problems in the orientations of young people are being forced into the background .
the level of criticism and non ­ compliance with the events and the acts of the authorities , which previously took place in the Ukraine , the countries óf the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe , remains quite high .
under the influence of many social ­ economic and other factors , the value orientations of students are considerably changing from being all ­ humane to more mercantile and Pragma ­ tic .
there was a massive need for the right advice and , although the readiness to break new ground was rather tentative to begin with , the chance to travel and get involved in international youth exchange programmes proved irresistible in the end .
two , three years have passed and we realize that the readiness in the Western part of Germany to share , in order to fürther the development of a common Germany , has decidedly decreased .
for even within the EC , youth work is still a very underdeveloped area , despite the brave Strug ­ gle on the part of Mr. Tsolakis , and we will have to develop this area jointly in terms of these new tasks .
I believe that one CANNOT simply concentrate on an exchange between regions , but one will rather have to take a good look at the deep gap between West and East , that is , the deep gap between rich and poor .
it was under these circumstances that the idea to introduce a new strand of activities , after the model of pilot projects implemented within the framework of the European Community Youth for Europe Programme , was developed .
at this point , let us elaborate on the expectations the partici ­ pants of our working group had concerning future youth exchan ­ ge programmes of youth exchan ­ ge between East and West .
it can often be noted that , for the majority of organizers and leaders of international youth events , as well as for those who take part in them , the appearance of conflicts is deemed to be a threat or a sign of failure .
in any case , it is worth reflecting on the function of preconceptions ( as an aid to self @-@ definition , experiencing one 's own identity through a clearer separation of the self and non @-@ self ) .
one of the main problems arising in cross @-@ cultural encounter situations is that of knowing how to go about planning joint projects , while still managing to take into account the diversity of the feelings and cultural behaviours present .

the preparation of the report would not have been possible without the close collaboration and support provided by Eurydice , the network on education systems and policies in Europe and the Bologna Follow @-@ Up Group .
since the beginning of the 2000s , the Bologna Process has expanded from the European Union towards the neighbouring countries and the Bologna Declaration has by now been signed by 47 countries .
this study was put together by the unit in charge of the management of the Tempus programme , in close cooperation with the unit coordinating Eurydice , the well @-@ known network on education systems and policies in Europe .
the second category contains the introduction of the Diploma Supplement , the development of a National Qualifications Framework and the setting @-@ up of an independent body for quality assurance in higher education .
a common model has been developed for the Bachelor and Master programmes whereas the third cycle has , to a large extent , been left in the hands of universities with no attempt to introduce further regulation within the Bologna Process .
in a third category of countries ( Algeria , Albania , Azerbaijan , Croatia , Montenegro and Tunisia ) contact hours or a combination of contact hours and student workload are still used as a reference to define the credits .
these steps have been defined by the Eurydice network19on the basis of the recommended ten steps scale proposed by the Bologna Follow @-@ up Group 's ( BFUG ) working group on Qualifications Frameworks led by the Council of Europe .
in higher education , quality assurance can be defined as policies , procedures and practices that are designed to achieve , maintain or enhance quality as it is understood in a specific context .
in Israel , for the moment , a government @-@ dependent body , the Quality Assessment Unit in the Council for Higher Education , is mainly responsible for evaluating and accrediting study programmes .
the programme is integrated into the European Union 's ' Neighbourhood ' , ' Enlargement ' and ' Development ' policies , which aim to promote prosperity , stability and security in the targeted regions .
the Bologna Process is the product of a series of meetings of Ministers responsible for higher education at which policy decisions have been taken with the goal to establish a European Higher Education Area by 2010 .
in Western Europe , emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel use fell by 3 % between 1990 and 1995 , due to economic recession , the restructuring of industry in Germany and the switch from coal to natural gas for electricity generation .
natural gas is also found In dry seams , not in association with oil , as in the extensive Russian and NIS region gas fields . detection and extraction techniques are similar to those for oil .
the main uses of coal today are : • as fuel in thermo @-@ electric power stations • within the iron and steel industry , both as raw material for coke and as a fuel for smelt ­ ing and heating processes .
the generation process converts the chemical energy of the fuel into thermal energy ( steam ) which Is then condensed through the turbine giving mechanical energy , and final ­ ly the generator converts this turning into electricity .
► the national and global importance of reducing our energy consumption ► the concept of energy efficiency as a resource ► opportunities to reduce the amount of energy used in society , both at a national level , and locally In schools and in the home .
some of the reasons are a lack of good insulation In buildings , poor efficiency of ageing municipal heating networks and the inability ( or incentive ) for individual families to control their heating use .
examples of the type of Information that can be usefully collected are given in the previous sections of this handbook and in the box below . energy statistics can be compiled from many other sources .
the heat energy which is produced by natural processes Inside the earth . it can be extracted from hot springs , reservoirs of hot water deep below the ground or from hot rocks In the earth 's crust .
should a co @-@ operative make advanced payments for the products delivered by the mem ­ bers - but this Is unlikely at least at the beginning - It would also require a corresponding level of working capital .
the preparation of an application is time @-@ consuming : only after one or two years of operation , once a co @-@ operative has acquired some strength , could such an application be considered .
in Brody , Lvov Region , the canned peas processed by the plant - which is a member of the Brody Farmers ' Association - are marketed either directly by the members , or collec ­ tively by the co @-@ operative .
as far as the members ' produce is concerned , a co @-@ operative which Is just starting , lack ­ ing working capital , can hardly make advance payments to the producers at delivery time .
but a co @-@ Oper ­ ative and an advice centre are two different things - and both of them are useful : in a co ­ operative , advisory services come together with the provision of other services .
the executive manager 's activity should be closely controlled by the producers and there should be a mutual trust and dialogue between the President and the Executive Manager . these are the keys to an efficient management .
in Novosibirsk , the share capital depends on the objective of each co ­ operative . the amounts range from 8 million Rb ( US $ 1,500 for the milk sector ) to 1,500 million Rb ( for meat processing ) .
cash flow state ­ ments for the co @-@ operative as well as for the farms attest to the capacity of the co @-@ Oper ­ ative to face its operating expenses and repayments .
TACIS does this by providing grant finance for know @-@ how to support the process of transformation to market economies and democratic societies .
it is a necessary measure for enterprises overloaded with debts . however , creditors will not accept to initiate it in the absence of a credible plan for overall restructuring and recovery .
to maximise the advices provided by the consultants , the manager has to allocate one or several professionals to work with the consultants so as to help them to make the diagnosis as quickly as possible .
the Russian or Ukrainian companies have net only to dispose of social assets , but of assets not relevant to their core business . most companies have already initiated this process , and are moving towards a leaner company .
available commercial information on competitors was entered into the company 's database • launching of a TV campaign on the company 's products ( tubes , safety doors , heating equipment ) In Spring 1997 ( TV network ΤΕΤ ) .
the purpose of this range is both to com ­ Pete in design and price with foreign or local products , and to reduce production costs through a better rationalisation of the design and the production processes .
after four successful enlargements ( 1973 , 1981 , 1986 , 1995 ) , which increased the EU membershipfrom six to fifteen members , the European Union is now finalising its biggest enlargement ever .
however , in view of the present EU enlargement and in the context of its Northern Dimension policy for the development and integration of the Baltic region , the European Union has a firm commitment to assisting the development of Kaliningrad oblast .
● Private Sector- In order to support Kaliningrad 's efforts towards the improvement of its businessenvironment and economic development , the EU has focused its assistance on enterprise restructuring , human resource development , promotion of innovative Small and Medium @-@ sized Enterprises , and support for the energy sector .
the bilateral Space Dialogue between the European Union and Russia was launched in 1998 . Bothsides have a mutual interest in multiplying the cooperation projects in the area of Space and applied Space technologies , taking into account their social and economic potential .
the EU @-@ Russia Summits held in Brussels in October 2001 and in Moscow in May 2002 established important guidelines for the practical implementation of the strategic partnership between the EU and Russia by , amongst other means , stepping up the Energy Dialogue .
