this led to an over @@@ -@@ @ concentration , in particular countries , of some industries and the neg@@ ligence of others .
they were dismantled , as the latter closed down their training facilities due to a lack of resources .
the breakdown of the planned system and the subsequent break down of contacts between schools and companies had serious implications for the provision of specific vocational training .
the result was schools with outdated and poor equipment , uncertain of their new role .
they had , parallel to their particular subject , studied ped@@ ag@@ ogy at university .
in addition , ministries of labour that have often emerged from ministries formerly in charge of social affairs ( health and pension schemes , etc . ) have assumed responsibilities for training / retraining of the unemployed .
another trend is the increasing share of private ventures in the training market , although scales are still limited and their engagement remains ' niche ' -@@ oriented .
the previously existing trade unions suffered from a major loss of their legitimacy and a drastic decrease in membership , which forced them to radically re @@@ -@@ @ orient themselves towards new functions .
this is coupled with a considerable degree of resistance from the universities themselves to what they consider a competing sector .
with the withdrawal of state and enterprises , the employment services have been left to take charge of ( parts of ) continuing education and training .
in addition , capacities of individual companies need to be strengthened to identify their own skill requirements and training needs .
9 % of students in vocational education and training schools were trained in their mother tongue ( 1997 / 98 ) .
the Programme aims to contribute to the development of the higher education systems in the partner countries and their interaction with civil society and industry .
University management comprises strategic management and day @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ day administration .
each project should aim at developing and delivering short ­ cycle ( 1 ­ 6 months ) training or retraining courses for national administrators , professional associations , the semi public sector and local / regional administrators .
projects must incorporate recognition of any study period spent abroad through the introduction of academic recognition mechanisms ( e.g. EC@@ TS ) .
it is strongly suggested that networks aim at increasing the number of consortium members participating in the network over the period of funding .
the partners involved in T@@ emp@@ us projects are expected to invest part of their own staff resources in carrying out tasks .
these tasks include course development , the development and adaptation of teaching materials , and the preparation and teaching of intensive courses especially developed for the project .

identification of economic players is another aspect of the problem .
we also need to agree on a financing policy , which is a complicated administrative problem .
the subject @@@ -@@ @ matter departments prepare their annual work program too , separated in it the usual , repeated tasks by data collections and the new , methodological , conceptual developments .
on the base of the new techniques we created the Publishing section which has the responsibility to define the forms and standards of the publications and to take over step by step the editorial activity from the subject @@@ -@@ @ matter departments .
the migration practically has three different parts .

the rapid increase in the power of PCs and database managers has accent@@ u@@ ated this trend .
the SAS product , well known for its statistical potential , has evolved into a development tool .
to achieve this , Euro@@ stat will need to examine not only its own internal organisation but also the accompanying Information Systems Architecture ( ISA ) that will be required .
in addition to that , stati@@ sti@@ cians need to design their own E@@ DI messages both for collection and dissemination of@@ statistical information .

these loans and credits are highly unlikely to involve assistance for statistics , with perhaps one exception .
we consider this programme important for many reasons known by you all : high quality statistics are needed for political and economic decision making .
before going on to discussions , I would like to make a comment of my own .
these three components all go together and carry an equal weight .
if a car is constructed bit by bit and there are difficulties in the process , it will be hard to make it run .
the provisions were designed 4 years ago and were based on parameters that were valid then . they now need to be adjusted to current circumstances .
the government should accept that it shares the cost of running the system with the statistical office .
it would include work forecasts and productivity targets and explain how computer@@ ization will support statistical work to meet current needs .
a statistical office that has its own computer centre can guarantee confidentiality of data as no unauthorised access is permitted from the outside .
on the contrary , it is important to select topics for discussion , from where it should be possible to achieve the adequ@@ ated solution .
shall they arrive until a unique person number ?
it is my impression that most FS@@ U statistical offices are still too modest in their public relations .
its success , therefore , is dependent on the ability to establish effective working relationships between partners .

confronted with serious financial difficulties , collective farms often had no other alter@@ na ­ tive than to sell off portions of their farm capital .
► Summer feed is insufficient The cows are exhausted by their winter milk production which has drained their body reserves and when they are put out to grass in May they must first of all restore their reserves .
the " First May " Kol@@ kho@@ z provided the pilot project with one of its two dairy herds living all year in the winter cow sheds ( 2 km apart ) .
the cow then draws on its ( decreasing ) bodily reserves , in a first stage to continue producing , losing weight and secondly to stay alive ( early drying up , embryo loss , ster@@ ility ) .
the M@@ IPO directors therefore visited several successful enterprises in UK and produced a list of lessons to be applied in their own organisation .
they must demonstrate their commitment to change through their personal everyday behavi@@ ours , for it is these that people will copy .
participants are encouraged through group discussion to examine their own organisation and the way they approach the internal and external customer .
by the end of the day people should have an action plan for how they will use the information gained on the course in their team .
at the end of the course managers will have developed their own tool kit for change which will be custom@@ ised to their own needs .

this industrial bakery , through its dynamic manager , supported the set up of the pilot private bakery from the very beginning .
the industrial bakery was only working at 70 % of its capacity .
this meant that the private bakery would address a demand already being met by the Industrial bakery , at least for traditional products . • The industrial bakery was not in a position to rapidly improve the fresh@@ ness of its products .
marketing has its own j@@ arg@@ on .
most customers are keen on novelty , and , If they are not " captive " because of lack of competition , they may easily change their purch@@ as ­ ing habits .
when a piece of equipment is purchased , it can be considered as a production cost throughout its life .
certain of them are destined to failure as ownership , especially when It is shared by numerous individuals , thus diluted , does not necessarily bring with it responsibility .
the EC@@ O concept is currently being replicated with T@@ ac@@ is support in a further eight districts of Yerevan and is receiving a great deal of attention from other regions of Armenia .
this responsibility also extends to carrying out maintenance of the local low voltage network and consumers can arrange with the EC@@ O to undertake repairs to cab@@ ling or apartment meters .
the EC@@ O has established a reserve to cover this revenue shortfall but in practice the poorest consumers are often supported by their wealthier neighbours on an informal basis .
outside of these industries , organisations that do not pay for consumption face having their electricity supplies cut @@@ -@@ @ off .

alongside its dominant textile and chemical industries and its mechanical engineering expertise , Tver has been able to pre ­ serve its cultural and scientific importance .
' note : taking into account the fact that some companies share pit@@ ches the total number of wholes@@ al@@ ers will be 93 .
private ownership runs the risk of failing in this basic principle .
it is also necessary to appoint those with the best interests of the market at heart , rather than their own person al gain .
the market maintains a positive image in the community and it is the management 's intention to maintain high standards .

in truth , we have much to learn from each other and must reconsider many things .
in his summary yesterday , Mr. Bun@@ z , head of the EC Com@@ miss@@ i ­ on delegation in Germany , very frankly po@@ in ­ T@@ ed out that the European Community is not the fortress nor the strongh@@ old it is often per ­ c@@ ei@@ ved to be .
we , here in this strange East / West interface of Berlin and Pot@@ s@@ dam , have noticed that there are some people who even feel threatened by the ending of the separation between East and West .
we have set our@@ sel ­ ves the goal that such involvement will also be rewarded by the creation of a career structure with recognized qualifications .
we know that youth exchange alone C@@ AN@@ NOT bring Europe together , and that it alone C@@ AN@@ NOT prevent a new social frontier from arising in Europe .
in Germany , policy in the youth field , as in all others , eman@@ ates from the basic concept that the state does not have the responsibility to regulate all vic@@ is@@ sit@@ udes of life .
common concerns of the original initi@@ ators ( political deci@@ sion@@ makers in cooperation with strong youth associations ) , were , among others , the following :
although the Community has no armed forces , police or security service of its own , the member states are subject to its authority .
for this reason I will refrain from putting names to countries in such an introduction ; that should be reserved for a more complete and careful approach .
instead I will talk of " some regions in Europe , " of " certain countries " of , " one country " etc . , and you can make up your own minds .
consequently each generation and each culture has created its own understanding of youth .
however , these phenomena become open , aggressive and popular with young people when a society begins to lose faith in itself , and in its capacity to master the future .
are they really so far from the truth , once you have produced your own mixed assessment ?
one of the most severe punitive measures was expulsion from this Union , which carried further consequences .
a number of political parties in Bulgaria have tried and are still trying to build up their own youth structures as a means of ensuring their future survival · .
the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party under Dr. Peter Der@@ t@@ li@@ ev , which until mid 1991 was the largest and best organized political force within the UD@@ F , has also established its own youth organization .
the Socialist Youth Organization ( SY@@ A ) is known for its harder line and closer contact with the B@@ SP , but it has fewer followers .
the Education Act of the Republic of Estonia ( which became law on 23 March 1992 ) interpre@@ ts the term education as including the encouragement of interests .
this includes exchanging ideas on working with those who have difficulty becoming integrated in their social surroundings .
a main condition for the implementation of programme @@@ -@@ @ based youth policy is that the local government should ac@@ know@@ leg@@ de its political and actual responsibility for local policy development and its implementation .
society is failing to make full use of the abilities of most young people .
the conditions are ripe for the emergence of large marginal groups since youn@@ gsters are more likely than other age groups to lose what are already rather weak functional links with society .
all youth policy in Russia is aimed at developing the innovative powers which will help young people become self @@@ -@@ @ sufficient and discover for themselves new areas of productive and creative activity .
without some assistance and support on the part of the state and its structures , such organizations will as a rule become " debtors " of adults ' organizations , which use them for their political purposes , or they will dissolve .
a group of young people visit their partner group for a period of 10 to 15 days and then host them when they come to visit .
'@@ Well , you either get tar@@ red and feather@@ ed , or you get n@@ ailed to the wall , or they put you in boiling oil . '
but I believe that , on the other hand , it also harb@@ ours a great dan ger , and I would like to expand on that by using the example of the Fre@@ ie Deutsche Ju@@ g@@ end .
people went on the move , put themselves in motion and , for example , went to collect their welcoming money .
on the one hand East Germans went to collect their welcoming money , and on the other West Germans set out for the East , succum@@ bing to the addiction for specul@@ ating and real estate buying .

they should also think about the significance of using interpreters or other arrangements , with the advantages and drawbacks these involve .
" language experience " could be included in such a specialization process .

rather than having strictly defined ideological aims it sought to protect human values and to cultivate humanitarian ideas and the revival of Russian culture .

they all coordinate their economic policymaking to support the aims of EMU .
to reach complete economic integration would require all Member States to join the euro area and harmon@@ ise their fiscal policies , including taxation , and other economic policies .
between 1994 and 1998 , Member States made significant progress in economic policy convergence and took steps to align their budgetary positions with the Maastricht criteria .
the Member States that joined the EU in 2004 and 2007 are part of EMU - which means that they coordinate their economic policymaking with the other EU Member States and that their central banks are part of the ESC@@ B .
