little by little I will drive them out from before you , until you have increased and inherit the land .
you shall make its dishes , its spo@@ ons , its lad@@ les , and its bow@@ ls to pour out offerings with . you shall make them of pure gold .
" you shall make an altar to burn inc@@ ense on . you shall make it of ac@@ ac@@ ia wood .
" ' for whoever shall do any of these ab@@ om@@ inations , even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people .
" ' if a man lies with a woman having her monthly period , and un@@ covers her n@@ ak@@ edness ; he has made naked her fountain , and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood : and both of them shall be cut off from among their people .
" ' notwithstanding , no devoted thing , that a man shall devote to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of all that he has , whether of man or animal , or of the field of his possession , shall be sold or re@@ deemed : every devoted thing is most holy to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
for what great nation is there , that has a god so near to them , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God is whenever we call on him ?
to drive out nations from before you greater and mi@@ gh@@ tier than you , to bring you in , to give you their land for an inheritance , as at this day .
and there you shall eat before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to , you and your households , in which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God has blessed you .
when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God shall cut off the nations from before you , where you go in to dis@@ possess them , and you dis@@ possess them , and dwell in their land ;
for whoever does these things is an ab@@ om@@ ination to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : and because of these ab@@ om@@ inations Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God does drive them out from before you .
to a foreigner you may lend on interest ; but to your brother you shall not lend on interest , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God may bless you in all that you put your hand to , in the land where you go in to possess it .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will command the blessing on you in your bar@@ ns , and in all that you put your hand to ; and he will bless you in the land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , he will go over before you ; he will destroy these nations from before you , and you shall dis@@ possess them . Joshua shall go over before you , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken .
for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you , until you had passed over , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God did to the Red Sea , which he dried up from before us , until we had passed over ;
the men of A@@ i struck about thirty @@@ -@@ @ six men of them , and they ch@@ ased them from before the gate even to She@@ b@@ ari@@ m , and struck them at the descent . the hearts of the people melted , and became like water .
I , and all the people who are with me , will approach to the city . it shall happen , when they come out against us , as at the first , that we will flee before them .
all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Mis@@ re@@ pho@@ th M@@ aim , even all the Sid@@ onians ; them will I drive out from before the children of Israel : only allocate it to Israel for an inheritance , as I have commanded you .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God will thrust them out from before you , and drive them from out of your sight . you shall possess their land , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God spoke to you .
" ' I brought you into the land of the A@@ mor@@ ites , that lived beyond the Jordan : and they fought with you ; and I gave them into your hand . you possessed their land ; and I destroyed them from before you .

David asked him , " To whom do you belong ? where are you from ? " he said , " I am a young man of Egypt , servant to an A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ite ; and my master left me , because three days ago I fell sick .
I have been with you wherever you went , and have cut off all your enemies from before you . I will make you a great name , like the name of the great ones who are in the earth .
so the messenger went , and came and showed David all that Jo@@ ab had sent him for .
there was c@@ edar on the house within , carved with bu@@ ds and open flowers : all was c@@ edar ; there was no stone seen .
he prepared an or@@ acle in the midst of the house within , to set there the ark of the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
he answered , " I have not troubled Israel ; but you , and your father 's house , in that you have for@@ s@@ aken the commandments of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and you have followed the Ba@@ als .
the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of ; and he saved himself there , not once nor twice .
I have been with you wherever you have gone , and have cut off all your enemies from before you . I will make you a name , like the name of the great ones who are in the earth .
Don '@@ t cover their ini@@ qu@@ ity , and don '@@ t let their sin be blo@@ tted out from before you ; for they have insul@@ ted the builders . "
he took for himself a pot@@ sh@@ er@@ d to sc@@ rape himself with , and he sat among the ashes .
as through a wide breach they come , in the midst of the ruin they roll themselves in .
as for me , I said in my ha@@ ste , " I am cut off from before your eyes . " nevertheless you heard the voice of my peti@@ tions when I cried to you .
you hem me in behind and before . you laid your hand on me .
who did he take counsel with , and who instructed him , and taught him in the path of justice , and taught him knowledge , and showed him the way of understanding ?
for this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
the sword is outside , and the pesti@@ l@@ ence and the famine within : he who is in the field shall die with the sword : and he who is in the city , famine and pesti@@ l@@ ence shall dev@@ our him .
it has happened after all your w@@ ick@@ edness , ( w@@ oe , w@@ oe to you ! says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ) ,
son of man , tell her , You are a land that is not cleans@@ ed , nor rained on in the day of indignation .
they took counsel , and bought the pot@@ ter 's field with them , to bury strangers in .
I tell you , it will be more toler@@ able in that day for So@@ dom than for that city .
they cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t find what they might do , for all the people hung on to every word that he said .
they said this testing him , that they might have something to accuse him of . but Jesus sto@@ op@@ ed down , and wrote on the ground with his finger .
for if I have done wrong , and have committed anything worthy of death , I don '@@ t refuse to die ; but if none of those things is true that they accuse me of , no one can give me up to them . I appeal to Caes@@ ar ! "
when much time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous , because the Fast had now already gone by , Paul admon@@ ished them ,
knowing this , that our old man was cruci@@ fied with him , that the body of sin might be done away with , so that we would no longer be in bond@@ age to sin .
they also , if they don '@@ t continue in their un@@ belief , will be gra@@ fted in , for God is able to gra@@ ft them in again .
but if a revelation is made to another sitting by , let the first keep silent .
and God is able to make all grace abound to you , that you , always having all sufficiency in everything , may abound to every good work .
now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident , for , " The righteous will live by faith . "
that no one should take advantage of and wrong a brother or sister in this matter ; because the Lord is an Av@@ enger in all these things , as also we fore@@ warned you and testified .
and they came to the place which God had told him of ; and Abraham built an altar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar upon the wood .
is not this it in which my lord drin@@ ket@@ h , and whereby indeed he div@@ in@@ eth ? ye have done evil in so doing .
for Phar@@ aoh will say of the children of Israel , They are ent@@ angled in the land , the wilderness hath shut them in .
and thou shalt make an altar to burn inc@@ ense upon : of sh@@ it@@ tim wood shalt thou make it .
and he over@@ laid it with pure gold within and without , and made a crown of gold to it round about .
and the curious gir@@ dle of his ep@@ ho@@ d , that was upon it , was of the same , according to the work thereof ; of gold , blue , and purple , and scar@@ let , and fine tw@@ ined linen ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
for wh@@ oso@@ ever shall commit any of these ab@@ om@@ inations , even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people .
therefore shall ye keep mine ordin@@ ance , that ye commit not any one of these ab@@ om@@ in@@ able customs , which were committed before you , and that ye def@@ ile not yourselves therein : I am the LORD your God .
therefore every one that e@@ at@@ eth it shall bear his ini@@ qu@@ ity , because he hath prof@@ an@@ ed the hal@@ lowed thing of the LORD : and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
and if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness , and shall un@@ cover her n@@ ak@@ edness ; he hath discovered her fountain , and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood : and both of them shall be cut off from among their people .
but the soul that do@@ eth ought presu@@ mp@@ tu@@ ously , whether he be born in the land , or a stranger , the same repro@@ ach@@ eth the LORD ; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
unto a stranger thou may@@ est lend upon us@@ ury ; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon us@@ ury : that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all that thou sett@@ est th@@ ine hand to in the land whi@@ ther thou go@@ est to possess it .
for the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you , until ye were passed over , as the LORD your God did to the Red sea , which he dried up from before us , until we were gone over :
and the men of A@@ i smo@@ te of them about thirty and six men : for they ch@@ ased them from before the gate even unto She@@ b@@ ari@@ m , and smo@@ te them in the going down : W@@ herefore the hearts of the people melted , and became as water .
and I brought you into the land of the A@@ mor@@ ites , which d@@ wel@@ t on the other side Jordan ; and they fought with you : and I gave them into your hand , that ye might possess their land ; and I destroyed them from before you .
wil@@ t not thou possess that which Chem@@ osh thy god gi@@ v@@ eth thee to possess ? so wh@@ om@@ soever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us , them will we possess .
so the messenger went , and came and sh@@ ew@@ ed David all that Jo@@ ab had sent him for .
and he built twenty cub@@ its on the sides of the house , both the floor and the walls with boards of c@@ edar : he even built them for it within , even for the or@@ acle , even for the most holy place .
and under the bri@@ m of it round about there were kno@@ ps comp@@ assing it , ten in a cub@@ it , comp@@ assing the sea round about : the kno@@ ps were cast in two rows , when it was cast .
nevertheless he cle@@ av@@ ed unto the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , which made Israel to sin ; he departed not there@@ from .
and the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of , and saved himself there , not once nor twice .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , and followed the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , which made Israel to sin ; he departed not there@@ from .
and he built the city round about , even from Mill@@ o round about : and Jo@@ ab repaired the rest of the city .
but David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under : because the LORD had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens .
and he made the V@@ ail of blue , and purple , and cri@@ m@@ son , and fine linen , and wrought cher@@ ub@@ ims there@@ on .
How@@ be@@ it the high places were not taken away : for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers .
Es@@ ther had not yet sh@@ ew@@ ed her kind@@ red nor her people ; as Mor@@ dec@@ ai had charged her : for Es@@ ther did the commandment of Mor@@ dec@@ ai , like as when she was brought up with him .
so the posts that rode upon mul@@ es and cam@@ els went out , being ha@@ st@@ ened and pressed on by the king 's commandment . and the decree was given at Sh@@ ush@@ an the palace .
thou art my hiding place ; thou shalt preserve me from trouble ; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliver@@ ance . Sel@@ ah .
for innumerable evils have comp@@ assed me about : mine ini@@ qu@@ ities have taken hold upon me , so that I am not able to look up ; they are more than the ha@@ irs of mine head : therefore my heart fail@@ eth me .
W@@ herefore should I fear in the days of evil , when the ini@@ qu@@ ity of my heels shall compass me about ?
all nations comp@@ assed me about : but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them .
they comp@@ assed me about ; ye@@ a , they comp@@ assed me about : but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them .
thou hast bes@@ et me behind and before , and laid th@@ ine hand upon me .
bring my soul out of prison , that I may praise thy name : the righteous shall compass me about ; for thou shalt deal boun@@ ti@@ fully with me .
prepare thy work without , and make it fit for thy@@ self in the field ; and afterwards build th@@ ine house .
bring no more vain ob@@ l@@ ations ; inc@@ ense is an ab@@ om@@ ination unto me ; the new mo@@ ons and sab@@ baths , the calling of assemblies , I C@@ AN@@ NOT away with ; it is ini@@ qu@@ ity , even the solemn meeting .
for this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
and see@@ k@@ est thou great things for thy@@ self ? seek them not : for , behold , I will bring evil upon all flesh , sa@@ ith the LORD : but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whi@@ ther thou go@@ est .
then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight , as stuff for removing : and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight , as they that go forth into cap@@ tivity .
and I will make thee like the top of a rock : thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon ; thou shalt be built no more : for I the LORD have spoken it , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
and within were hoo@@ ks , an hand broad , fast@@ ened round about : and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering .
and they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their w@@ ick@@ edness : now their own do@@ ings have bes@@ et them about ; they are before my face .
for , lo , I will command , and I will si@@ ft the house of Israel among all nations , like as corn is si@@ fted in a si@@ eve , yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth .
thou did@@ st strike through with his st@@ aves the head of his villages : they came out as a whir@@ l@@ wind to sc@@ atter me : their rejo@@ icing was as to dev@@ our the poor secretly .
and they took counsel , and bought with them the pot@@ ter 's field , to bury strangers in .
and hearing the multitude pass by , he asked what it meant .
but Peter stood at the door without . then went out that other disciple , which was known unto the high priest , and sp@@ ake unto her that kept the door , and brought in Peter .
( for as yet he was fallen upon none of them : only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus . )
was then that which is good made death unto me ? God forbid . but sin , that it might appear sin , working death in me by that which is good ; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful .
and they also , if they abide not still in un@@ belief , shall be gra@@ ffed in : for God is able to Gra@@ ff them in again .
if any thing be revealed to another that sit@@ t@@ eth by , let the first hold his peace .
where@@ upon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood .
