on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made ; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made .
God blessed the seventh day , and made it holy , because he rested in it from all his work which he had created and made .
the man said , " This is now bone of my bones , and flesh of my flesh . she will be called ' woman , ' because she was taken out of Man . "
therefore a man will leave his father and his mother , and will join with his wife , and they will be one flesh .
to the woman he said , " I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth . in pain you will bear children . your desire will be for your husband , and he will rule over you . "
the man called his wife Eve , because she was the mother of all living .
A@@ bel also brought some of the fir@@ st@@ born of his flock and of its fat . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h respected A@@ bel and his offering ,
if you do well , will it not be lifted up ? if you don '@@ t do well , sin c@@ rou@@ ches at the door . its desire is for you , but you are to rule over it . "
now you are cur@@ sed because of the ground , which has opened its mouth to receive your brother 's blood from your hand .
from now on , when you till the ground , it won '@@ t yield its strength to you . you shall be a fu@@ gi@@ tive and a wan@@ der@@ er in the earth . "
Lam@@ ech said to his wives , " Ad@@ ah and Z@@ il@@ lah , hear my voice . you wives of Lam@@ ech , listen to my speech , for I have sl@@ ain a man for w@@ ounding me , a young man for bru@@ ising me .
Adam lived one hundred thirty years , and became the father of a son in his own lik@@ eness , after his image , and named him S@@ eth .
that God 's sons saw that men 's daughters were beautiful , and they took for themselves wives of all that they chose .
God saw the earth , and saw that it was corrupt , for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth .
God said to Noah , " The end of all flesh has come before me , for the earth is filled with violence through them . behold , I will destroy them with the earth .
take with you of all food that is eaten , and gather it to yourself ; and it will be for food for you , and for them . "
he sent out a do@@ ve from him , to see if the waters were abated from the surface of the ground ,
but the do@@ ve found no place to rest her foot , and she returned to him into the ship ; for the waters were on the surface of the whole earth . he put out his hand , and took her , and brought her to him into the ship .
bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh , including birds , livestock , and every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ eps on the earth , that they may breed ab@@ und@@ antly in the earth , and be fruitful , and multiply on the earth . "
every animal , every cre@@ eping thing , and every bird , whatever moves on the earth , after their families , went out of the ship .
he drank of the wine and got drunk . he was uncovered within his tent .
She@@ m and Jap@@ h@@ eth took a garment , and laid it on both their shoulders , went in backwards , and covered the n@@ ak@@ edness of their father . their faces were backwards , and they did@@ n '@@ t see their father 's n@@ ak@@ edness .
he said , " Can@@ a@@ an is cur@@ sed . he will be servant of servants to his brothers . "
of these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands , everyone after his language , after their families , in their nations .
now Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Ab@@ ram , " Get out of your country , and from your relatives , and from your father 's house , to the land that I will show you .
it happened , when he had come near to enter Egypt , that he said to Sar@@ ai his wife , " See now , I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at .
why did you say , ' She is my sister , ' so that I took her to be my wife ? now therefore , see your wife , take her , and go your way . "
he went on his journeys from the South even to Be@@ the@@ l , to the place where his tent had been at the beginning , between Be@@ the@@ l and A@@ i ,
and blessed be God Most High , who has delivered your enemies into your hand . " Ab@@ ram gave him a tenth of all .
the king of So@@ dom said to Ab@@ ram , " Gi@@ ve me the people , and take the goods to yourself . "
Ab@@ ram said , " Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , what will you give me , since I go chil@@ dless , and he who will inherit my estate is Eli@@ ez@@ er of Damascus ? "
behold , the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came to him , saying , " This man will not be your heir , but he who will come out of your own body will be your heir . "
he said to Ab@@ ram , " Know for sure that your seed will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs , and will serve them . they will aff@@ l@@ ict them four hundred years .
but you will go to your fathers in peace . you will be buried in a good old age .
he said , " Hag@@ ar , Sar@@ ai 's hand@@ maid , where did you come from ? where are you going ? " she said , " I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sar@@ ai . "
Hag@@ ar bore a son for Ab@@ ram . Ab@@ ram called the name of his son , whom Hag@@ ar bore , I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el .
Ab@@ ram fell on his face . God talked with him , saying ,
I will establish my covenant between me and you and your seed after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant , to be a God to you and to your seed after you .
I will give to you , and to your seed after you , the land where you are traveling , all the land of Can@@ a@@ an , for an everlasting possession . I will be their God . "
then Abraham fell on his face , and laughed , and said in his heart , " Will a child be born to him who is one hundred years old ? will Sarah , who is ninety years old , give birth ? "
Abraham took I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el his son , all who were born in his house , and all who were bought with his money ; every male among the men of Abraham 's house , and circum@@ c@@ ised the flesh of their fores@@ kin in the same day , as God had said to him .
for I have known him , to the end that he may command his children and his household after him , that they may keep the way of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to do righteousness and justice ; to the end that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him . "
lot went out to them to the door , and shut the door after him .
it came to pass , when they had taken them out , that he said , " Es@@ cape for your life ! Don '@@ t look behind you , and don '@@ t stay anywhere in the plain . escape to the mountains , lest you be consumed ! "
Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h rose early in the morning , and called all his servants , and told all these things in their ear . the men were very scared .
then Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h called Abraham , and said to him , " What have you done to us ? how have I sin@@ ned against you , that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin ? you have done deeds to me that ought not to be done ! "
to Sarah he said , " Be@@ hold , I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver . behold , it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you . in front of all you are v@@ indicated . "
Abraham called his son who was born to him , whom Sarah bore to him , Isaac .
Abraham circum@@ c@@ ised his son , Isaac , when he was eight days old , as God had commanded him .
Abraham rose early in the morning , and sadd@@ led his don@@ key , and took two of his young men with him , and Isaac his son . he split the wood for the burnt offering , and rose up , and went to the place of which God had told him .
Abraham said to his young men , " Stay here with the don@@ key . the boy and I will go y@@ on@@ der . we will worship , and come back to you . "
he said , " Don '@@ t lay your hand on the boy , neither do anything to him . for now I know that you fear God , since you have not with@@ held your son , your only son , from me . "
Abraham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the th@@ icket by his horns . Abraham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son .
that I will bless you greatly , and I will multiply your seed greatly like the stars of the heavens , and like the sand which is on the se@@ ash@@ ore . your seed will possess the gate of his enemies .
in your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed , because you have obeyed my voice . "
" I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you . give me a possession of a bur@@ ying @@@ -@@ @ place with you , that I may bury my dead out of my sight . "
" my lord , listen to me . what is a piece of land worth four hundred she@@ k@@ els of silver between me and you ? therefore bury your dead . "
Abraham said to his servant , the elder of his house , who ruled over all that he had , " Please put your hand under my thi@@ gh .
if the woman is@@ n '@@ t willing to follow you , then you shall be clear from this my oath . only you shall not bring my son there again . "
the servant put his hand under the thi@@ gh of Abraham his master , and s@@ wore to him concerning this matter .
the servant took ten cam@@ els , of his master 's cam@@ els , and departed , having a variety of good things of his master 's with him . he arose , and went to Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , to the city of N@@ ah@@ or .
the young lady was very beautiful to look at , a virgin , neither had any man known her . she went down to the spring , filled her p@@ itch@@ er , and came up .
she said , " Dr@@ ink , my lord . " she hur@@ ried , and let down her p@@ itch@@ er on her hand , and gave him drink .
when she had done giving him drink , she said , " I will also draw for your cam@@ els , until they have done drinking . "
she hur@@ ried , and emp@@ tied her p@@ itch@@ er into the tr@@ ough , and ran again to the well to draw , and drew for all his cam@@ els .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to her , " Two nations are in your womb . two peoples will be separated from your body . the one people will be stronger than the other people . the elder will serve the younger . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h appeared to him the same night , and said , " I am the God of Abraham your father . Don '@@ t be afraid , for I am with you , and will bless you , and multiply your seed for my servant Abraham 's sake . "
he built an altar there , and called on the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and pit@@ ched his tent there . there Isaac 's servants dug a well .
Isaac said to them , " Why have you come to me , since you hate me , and have sent me away from you ? "
that you will do us no harm , as we have not touched you , and as we have done to you nothing but good , and have sent you away in peace . ' you are now the blessed of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
when Es@@ au was forty years old , he took as wife Jud@@ ith , the daughter of Be@@ eri the Hit@@ tite , and Bas@@ em@@ ath , the daughter of El@@ on the Hit@@ tite .
he said , " See now , I am old . I don '@@ t know the day of my death .
now therefore , my son , obey my voice according to that which I command you .
you shall bring it to your father , that he may eat , so that he may bless you before his death . "
what if my father touches me ? I will seem to him as a decei@@ ver , and I would bring a curse on myself , and not a blessing . "
she gave the sav@@ ory food and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son Jacob .
he came to his father , and said , " My father ? " he said , " Here I am . who are you , my son ? "
Isaac said to his son , " How is it that you have found it so quickly , my son ? " he said , " Because Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gave me success . "
he said , " B@@ ring it near to me , and I will eat of my son 's ven@@ ison , that my soul may bless you . " he brought it near to him , and he ate . he brought him wine , and he drank .
it happened , as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob , and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Es@@ au his brother came in from his hunting .
he also made sav@@ ory food , and brought it to his father . he said to his father , " Let my father arise , and eat of his son 's ven@@ ison , that your soul may bless me . "
when Es@@ au heard the words of his father , he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry , and said to his father , " B@@ less me , even me also , my father . "
Isaac answered Es@@ au , " Be@@ hold , I have made him your lord , and all his brothers have I given to him for servants . with grain and new wine have I sustained him . what then will I do for you , my son ? "
Es@@ au said to his father , " Have you but one blessing , my father ? bless me , even me also , my father . " Es@@ au lifted up his voice , and we@@ pt .
Es@@ au hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him . Es@@ au said in his heart , " The days of mourning for my father are at hand . then I will kill my brother Jacob . "
now therefore , my son , obey my voice . arise , flee to Lab@@ an , my brother , in Har@@ an .
and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother , and was gone to P@@ add@@ an A@@ ram .
Es@@ au went to I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , and took , besides the wives that he had , Ma@@ hal@@ ath the daughter of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , Abraham 's son , the sister of Ne@@ bai@@ o@@ th , to be his wife .
your seed will be as the dust of the earth , and you will spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south . in you and in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed .
Jacob awakened out of his sleep , and he said , " Su@@ rely Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is in this place , and I did@@ n '@@ t know it . "
Jacob kis@@ sed Rach@@ el , and lifted up his voice , and we@@ pt .
Jacob told Rach@@ el that he was her father 's brother , and that he was Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah 's son . she ran and told her father .
Jacob did so , and fulfilled her week . he gave him Rach@@ el his daughter as wife .
Le@@ ah said , " Happy am I , for the daughters will call me happy . " she named him Ash@@ er .
give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you , and let me go ; for you know my service with which I have served you . "
for it was little which you had before I came , and it has increased to a multitude . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has blessed you wherever I turned . now when will I provide for my own house also ? "
he said , " What shall I give you ? " Jacob said , " You shall not give me anything . if you will do this thing for me , I will again feed your flock and keep it .
that day , he removed the male goats that were stre@@ aked and spotted , and all the female goats that were spec@@ k@@ led and spotted , every one that had white in it , and all the black ones among the sheep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
he set three days ' journey between himself and Jacob , and Jacob fed the rest of Lab@@ an 's f@@ locks .
Jacob sent and called Rach@@ el and Le@@ ah to the field to his flock ,
then Jacob rose up , and set his sons and his wives on the cam@@ els ,
and he took away all his livestock , and all his possessions which he had gathered , including the livestock which he had gained in P@@ add@@ an A@@ ram , to go to Isaac his father , to the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
now Lab@@ an had gone to she@@ ar his sheep : and Rach@@ el stole the ter@@ ap@@ him that were her father 's .
he took his relatives with him , and pursued after him seven days ' journey . he over@@ took him in the mountain of Gil@@ e@@ ad .
and did@@ n '@@ t allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters ? now have you done fool@@ ishly .
now , you want to be gone , because you greatly long@@ ed for your father 's house , but why have you stolen my gods ? "
anyone you find your gods with shall not live . before our relatives , discern what is yours with me , and take it . " for Jacob did@@ n '@@ t know that Rach@@ el had stolen them .
now that you have felt around in all my stuff , what have you found of all your household stuff ? set it here before my relatives and your relatives , that they may judge between us two .
that which was torn of animals , I did@@ n '@@ t bring to you . I bore its loss . of my hand you required it , whether stolen by day or stolen by night .
Jacob said to his relatives , " G@@ ather stones . " they took stones , and made a heap . they ate there by the heap .
if you aff@@ l@@ ict my daughters , or if you take wives besides my daughters , no man is with us ; behold , God is witness between me and you . "
Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain , and called his relatives to eat bread . they ate bread , and stayed all night in the mountain .
early in the morning , Lab@@ an rose up , and kis@@ sed his sons and his daughters , and blessed them . Lab@@ an departed and returned to his place .
Jacob went on his way , and the angels of God met him .
I have cattle , don@@ keys , f@@ locks , male servants , and female servants . I have sent to tell my lord , that I may find favor in your sight . ' "
he lodged there that night , and took from that which he had with him , a present for Es@@ au , his brother :
he delivered them into the hands of his servants , every herd by itself , and said to his servants , " Pass over before me , and put a space between herd and herd . "
he rose up that night , and took his two wives , and his two hand@@ m@@ aids , and his eleven sons , and passed over the ford of the Jab@@ bo@@ k .
Es@@ au said , " I have enough , my brother ; let that which you have be yours . "
Jacob said , " Please , no , if I have now found favor in your sight , then receive my present at my hand , because I have seen your face , as one sees the face of God , and you were pleased with me .
" these men are peaceful with us . therefore let them live in the land and trade in it . for behold , the land is large enough for them . let us take their daughters to us for wives , and let us give them our daughters .
let us arise , and go up to Be@@ the@@ l . I will make there an altar to God , who answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the way which I went . "
God said to him , " I am God Almighty . be fruitful and multiply . a nation and a company of nations will be from you , and kings will come out of your body .
Israel traveled , and spread his tent beyond the tower of E@@ der .
now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children , because he was the son of his old age , and he made him a coat of many colors .
he dreamed yet another dream , and told it to his brothers , and said , " Be@@ hold , I have dreamed yet another dream : and behold , the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me . "
he told it to his father and to his brothers . his father rebu@@ ked him , and said to him , " What is this dream that you have dreamed ? will I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves down to you to the earth ? "
his brothers went to feed their father 's flock in Sh@@ ec@@ hem .
Jacob t@@ ore his clothes , and put s@@ ack@@ cloth on his waist , and mour@@ ned for his son many days .
it happened at that time , that Jud@@ ah went down from his brothers , and visited a certain Ad@@ ul@@ lam@@ ite , whose name was Hir@@ ah .
On@@ an knew that the seed w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t be his ; and it happened , when he went in to his brother 's wife , that he spilled it on the ground , lest he should give seed to his brother .
she arose , and went away , and put off her veil from her , and put on the garments of her wi@@ do@@ wh@@ ood .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was with Joseph , and he was a prosperous man . he was in the house of his master the Egyptian .
it happened from the time that he made him over@@ se@@ er in his house , and over all that he had , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h blessed the Egyptian 's house for Joseph 's sake ; and the blessing of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was on all that he had , in the house and in the field .
he is@@ n '@@ t greater in this house than I , neither has he kept back anything from me but you , because you are his wife . how then can I do this great w@@ ick@@ edness , and sin against God ? "
she caught him by his garment , saying , " Li@@ e with me ! " he left his garment in her hand , and ran outside .
when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand , and had run outside ,
she called to the men of her house , and spoke to them , saying , " Be@@ hold , he has brought in a Hebrew to us to mo@@ ck us . he came in to me to lie with me , and I cried with a loud voice .
she laid up his garment by her , until his master came home .
and it happened , as I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment by me , and ran outside . "
the chief cu@@ p@@ be@@ arer told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , " In my dream , behold , a vine was in front of me ,
it happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled , and he sent and called for all of Egypt 's mag@@ icians and wise men . Phar@@ aoh told them his dreams , but there was no one who could interpret them to Phar@@ aoh .
then Phar@@ aoh sent and called Joseph , and they brought him hastily out of the dun@@ geon . he sha@@ ved himself , changed his clothing , and came in to Phar@@ aoh .
Phar@@ aoh said to his servants , " Can we find such a one as this , a man in whom is the Spirit of God ? "
Phar@@ aoh took off his sig@@ net ring from his hand , and put it on Joseph 's hand , and ar@@ ra@@ yed him in robes of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck ,
Phar@@ aoh said to Joseph , " I am Phar@@ aoh , and without you shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt . "
now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt , and Jacob said to his sons , " Why do you look at one another ? "
Joseph recognized his brothers , but they did@@ n '@@ t recognize him .
they loaded their don@@ keys with their grain , and departed from there .
as one of them opened his sack to give his don@@ key food in the lodging place , he saw his money . behold , it was in the mouth of his sack .
it happened as they emp@@ tied their s@@ acks , that behold , each man 's bundle of money was in his sack . when they and their father saw their bun@@ dles of money , they were afraid .
Re@@ ub@@ en spoke to his father , saying , " Kill my two sons , if I don '@@ t bring him to you . entr@@ ust him to my care , and I will bring him to you again . "
he lifted up his eyes , and saw Benjamin , his brother , his mother 's son , and said , " Is this your youngest brother , of whom you spoke to me ? " he said , " God be gr@@ acious to you , my son . "
he washed his face , and came out . he controlled himself , and said , " Ser@@ ve the meal . "
then they t@@ ore their clothes , and each man loaded his don@@ key , and returned to the city .
my lord asked his servants , saying , ' Have you a father , or a brother ? '
you said to your servants , ' Un@@ less your youngest brother comes down with you , you will see my face no more . '
now therefore , please let your servant stay instead of the boy , a bond@@ servant to my lord ; and let the boy go up with his brothers .
then Joseph cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t control himself before all those who stood before him , and he cried , " C@@ ause everyone to go out from me ! " no one else stood with him , while Joseph made himself known to his brothers .
Joseph said to his brothers , " I am Joseph ! does my father still live ? " his brothers cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t answer him ; for they were terrified at his presence .
Joseph said to his brothers , " Come near to me , please . " they came near . " he said , I am Joseph , your brother , whom you sold into Egypt .
you shall dwell in the land of Gos@@ hen , and you will be near to me , you , your children , your children 's children , your f@@ locks , your herds , and all that you have .
he kis@@ sed all his brothers , and we@@ pt on them . after that his brothers talked with him .
Phar@@ aoh said to Joseph , " Tell your brothers , ' Do this . load your animals , and go , travel to the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
he sent the following to his father : ten don@@ keys loaded with the good things of Egypt , and ten female don@@ keys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way .
they went up out of Egypt , and came into the land of Can@@ a@@ an , to Jacob their father .
he said , " I am God , the God of your father . Don '@@ t be afraid to go down into Egypt , for there I will make of you a great nation .
Jacob rose up from Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba , and the sons of Israel carried Jacob , their father , their little ones , and their wives , in the w@@ agons which Phar@@ aoh had sent to carry him .
they took their livestock , and their goods , which they had gotten in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and came into Egyp@@ t@@ -@@ -@@ Jacob , and all his seed with him ,
his sons , and his sons ' sons with him , his daughters , and his sons ' daughters , and he brought all his seed with him into Egypt .
Joseph prepared his ch@@ ari@@ ot , and went up to meet Israel , his father , in Gos@@ hen . he presented himself to him , and fell on his neck , and we@@ pt on his neck a good while .
Joseph said to his brothers , and to his father 's house , " I will go up , and speak with Phar@@ aoh , and will tell him , ' My brothers , and my father 's house , who were in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , have come to me .
then Joseph went in and told Phar@@ aoh , and said , " My father and my brothers , with their f@@ locks , their herds , and all that they own , have come out of the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; and behold , they are in the land of Gos@@ hen . "
Joseph placed his father and his brothers , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Ram@@ eses , as Phar@@ aoh had commanded .
Joseph nourished his father , his brothers , and all of his father 's household , with bread , according to their families .
they brought their livestock to Joseph , and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses , and for the f@@ locks , and for the herds , and for the don@@ keys : and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their livestock for that year .
it happened after these things , that someone said to Joseph , " Be@@ hold , your father is sick . " he took with him his two sons , Man@@ as@@ se@@ h and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
someone told Jacob , and said , " Be@@ hold , your son Joseph comes to you , " and Israel strengthened himself , and sat on the bed .
and said to me , ' Be@@ hold , I will make you fruitful , and multiply you , and I will make of you a company of peoples , and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession . '
your issue , whom you become the father of after them , will be yours . they will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance .
Israel said to Joseph , " I did@@ n '@@ t think I would see your face , and behold , God has let me see your seed also . "
Joseph brought them out from between his knees , and he bowed himself with his face to the earth .
when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , it dis@@ pleased him . he held up his father 's hand , to remove it from E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im 's head to Man@@ as@@ se@@ h 's head .
Jacob called to his sons , and said : " gather yourselves together , that I may tell you that which will happen to you in the days to come .
" Re@@ ub@@ en , you are my fir@@ st@@ born , my might , and the beginning of my strength ; exc@@ elling in dignity , and exc@@ elling in power .
binding his fo@@ al to the vine , his don@@ key 's col@@ t to the choice vine ; he has washed his garments in wine , his robes in the blood of grapes .
he saw a resting place , that it was good , the land , that it was pleasant . he b@@ ows his shoulder to the burden , and becomes a servant doing forced labor .
he instructed them , and said to them , " I am to be gathered to my people . bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of E@@ ph@@ ron the Hit@@ tite ,
when Jacob made an end of charging his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the spirit , and was gathered to his people .
all the house of Joseph , his brothers , and his father 's house . only their little ones , their f@@ locks , and their herds , they left in the land of Gos@@ hen .
they came to the thresh@@ ing floor of At@@ ad , which is beyond the Jordan , and there they lam@@ ented with a very great and severe lam@@ entation . he mour@@ ned for his father seven days .
Joseph said to his brothers , " I am dying , but God will surely visit you , and bring you up out of this land to the land which he s@@ wore to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob . "
now these are the names of the sons of Israel , who came into Egypt ( every man and his household came with Jacob ) :
when they came to Re@@ u@@ el , their father , he said , " How is it that you have returned so early today ? "
he said to his daughters , " Where is he ? why is it that you have left the man ? call him , that he may eat bread . "
but every woman shall ask of her neighbor , and of her who visits her house , jew@@ els of silver , jew@@ els of gold , and clothing ; and you shall put them on your sons , and on your daughters . you shall pl@@ under the Egyptians . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " St@@ ret@@ ch out your hand , and take it by the tail . " he stretched out his hand , and took hold of it , and it became a rod in his hand .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said furthermore to him , " Now put your hand inside your cloak . " he put his hand inside his cloak , and when he took it out , behold , his hand was le@@ pr@@ ous , as white as snow .
you shall take this rod in your hand , with which you shall do the signs . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses in Mi@@ dian , " Go , return into Egypt ; for all the men who sought your life are dead . "
Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them on a don@@ key , and he returned to the land of Egypt . Moses took God 's rod in his hand .
the t@@ ask@@ masters were urgent saying , " fulfill your work quota daily , as when there was straw ! "
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God ; and you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
Am@@ ram took Jo@@ che@@ bed his father 's sister to himself as wife ; and she bore him Aaron and Moses : and the years of the life of Am@@ ram were a hundred and thirty @@@ -@@ @ seven years .
go to Phar@@ aoh in the morning . behold , he goes out to the water ; and you shall stand by the river 's bank to meet him ; and the rod which was turned to a ser@@ pent you shall take in your hand .
the mag@@ icians of Egypt did the same thing with their enchan@@ tments ; and Phar@@ aoh 's heart was hardened , and he did@@ n '@@ t listen to them ; as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had spoken .
Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt ; and the fro@@ gs came up , and covered the land of Egypt .

God came to Bal@@ a@@ am , and said , " Who are these men with you ? "
God 's anger was kind@@ led because he went ; and the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h placed himself in the way for an adversary against him . now he was riding on his don@@ key , and his two servants were with him .
Bal@@ a@@ am said to the don@@ key , " Because you have mo@@ cked me , I wish there were a sword in my hand , for now I would have killed you . "
then Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h opened the eyes of Bal@@ a@@ am , and he saw the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h standing in the way , with his sword drawn in his hand ; and he bowed his head , and fell on his face .
the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to him , " Why have you struck your don@@ key these three times ? behold , I have come forth as an adversary , because your way is perverse before me :
and the don@@ key saw me , and turned aside before me these three times . unless she had turned aside from me , surely now I would have killed you , and saved her alive . "
Bal@@ a@@ am said to Bal@@ ak , " Be@@ hold , I have come to you : have I now any power at all to speak anything ? the word that God puts in my mouth , that shall I speak . "

he took up his parable , and said , " Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Be@@ or says , the man whose eye was closed says ;

this is the thing which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h does command concerning the daughters of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had , saying , Let them be married to whom they think best ; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married .
so shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe ; for the children of Israel shall all keep the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father , that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers .

you shall keep his statutes , and his commandments , which I command you this day , that it may go well with you , and with your children after you , and that you may prolong your days in the land , which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , forever .
that the man@@ s@@ layer might flee there , who kills his neighbor un@@ awa@@ res , and did@@ n '@@ t hate him in time past ; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live :
" honor your father and your mother , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God commanded you ; that your days may be long , and that it may go well with you , in the land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you .
that you might fear Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , to keep all his statutes and his commandments , which I command you , you , and your son , and your son 's son , all the days of your life ; and that your days may be prolonged .
these words , which I command you this day , shall be on your heart ;
you shall write them on the door posts of your house , and on your gates .
neither shall you make marriages with them ; your daughter you shall not give to his son , nor shall you take his daughter for your son .
for he will turn away your son from following me , that they may serve other gods : so the anger of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h would be kind@@ led against you , and he would destroy you quickly .
it shall happen , because you listen to these ordin@@ ances , and keep and do them , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God will keep with you the covenant and the loving kindness which he s@@ wore to your fathers :
you shall consume all the peoples whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God shall deliver to you ; your eye shall not pity them : neither shall you serve their gods ; for that will be a sn@@ are to you .
he will deliver their kings into your hand , and you shall make their name to perish from under the sky : no man shall be able to stand before you , until you have destroyed them .
you shall remember all the way which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness , that he might humble you , to prove you , to know what was in your heart , whether you would keep his commandments , or not .
you shall consider in your heart that as a man cha@@ st@@ ens his son , so Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God cha@@ st@@ ens you .
who led you through the great and terrible wilderness , with fiery ser@@ p@@ ents and scor@@ pi@@ ons , and thir@@ sty ground where there was no water ; who brought you forth water out of the rock of fl@@ int ;
but you shall remember Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , for it is he who gives you power to get wealth ; that he may establish his covenant which he s@@ wore to your fathers , as at this day .
so I turned and came down from the mountain , and the mountain was burning with fire : and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands .
at that time Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to me , " C@@ ut two tables of stone like the first , and come up to me onto the mountain , and make an ark of wood .
for the land , where you go in to possess it , is@@ n '@@ t as the land of Egypt , that you came out from , where you s@@ owed your seed , and wat@@ ered it with your foot , as a garden of herbs ;
I will give grass in your fields for your livestock , and you shall eat and be full .
you shall write them on the door posts of your house , and on your gates ;
these are the statutes and the ordin@@ ances which you shall observe to do in the land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fathers , has given you to possess it , all the days that you live on the earth .
you shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dis@@ possess served their gods , on the high mountains , and on the hills , and under every green tree :
but in the place which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall choose in one of your tribes , there you shall offer your burnt offerings , and there you shall do all that I command you .
when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God shall enlarge your border , as he has promised you , and you shall say , " I want to eat meat , " because your soul desires to eat meat ; you may eat meat , after all the desire of your soul .
observe and hear all these words which I command you , that it may go well with you , and with your children after you forever , when you do that which is good and right in the eyes of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
you shall not do so to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God : for every ab@@ om@@ ination to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he h@@ ates , have they done to their gods ; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods .
if you shall hear tell concerning one of your cities , which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you to dwell there , saying ,
nothing of the devoted thing shall cling to your hand ; that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h may turn from the fierc@@ eness of his anger , and show you mercy , and have compassion on you , and multiply you , as he has sworn to your fathers ;
you shall surely ti@@ the all the increase of your seed , that which comes forth from the field year by year .
the Lev@@ ite who is within your gates , you shall not for@@ sake him ; for he has no portion nor inheritance with you .
this is the way of the release : every creditor shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor ; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother ; because Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's release has been proclaimed .
for the poor will never cease out of the land : therefore I command you , saying , You shall surely open your hand to your brother , to your ne@@ edy , and to your poor , in your land .
if your brother , a Hebrew man , or a Hebrew woman , is sold to you , and serves you six years ; then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you .
when you let him go free from you , you shall not let him go empty :
you shall fur@@ nish him liber@@ ally out of your flock , and out of your thresh@@ ing floor , and out of your win@@ ep@@ ress ; as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God has blessed you , you shall give to him .
it shall be , if he tells you , " I will not go out from you " ; because he loves you and your house , because he is well with you ;
you shall eat it within your gates : the un@@ clean and the clean shall eat it alike , as the gaz@@ elle , and as the hart .
you shall keep the feast of weeks to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God with a tribute of a fre@@ e@@ will offering of your hand , which you shall give , according as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God bl@@ esses you :
you shall keep the feast of tents seven days , after that you have gathered in from your thresh@@ ing floor and from your win@@ ep@@ ress :
you shall make judges and officers in all your gates , which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , according to your tribes ; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment .
if there is found in the midst of you , within any of your gates which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , man or woman , who does that which is evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , in Trans@@ gres@@ sing his covenant ,
if there arises a matter too hard for you in judgment , between blood and blood , between ple@@ a and ple@@ a , and between stroke and stroke , being matters of controversy within your gates ; then you shall arise , and go up to the place which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose ;
the man who does presu@@ mp@@ tu@@ ously , in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , or to the judge , even that man shall die : and you shall put away the evil from Israel .
you shall surely set him king over yourselves , whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose : one from among your brothers you shall set king over you ; you may not put a foreigner over you , who is not your brother .
and it shall be with him , and he shall read therein all the days of his life ; that he may learn to fear Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God , to keep all the words of this law and these statutes , to do them ;
then he shall minister in the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God , as all his brothers the Lev@@ ites do , who stand there before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
you shall be perfect with Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
you shall set apart three cities for you in the midst of your land , which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you to possess it .
this is the case of the man@@ s@@ layer , that shall flee there and live : whoever kills his neighbor un@@ awa@@ res , and did@@ n '@@ t hate him in time past ;
if Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God enlarg@@ es your border , as he has sworn to your fathers , and gives you all the land which he promised to give to your fathers ;
that innocent blood not be shed in the midst of your land , which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you for an inheritance , and so blood be on you .
you shall not remove your neighbor 's landmark , which they of old time have set , in your inheritance which you shall inherit , in the land that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you to possess it .
the officers shall speak to the people , saying , " What man is there who has built a new house , and has not dedicated it ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man dedic@@ ate it .
what man is there who has planted a viney@@ ard , and has not used its fruit ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man use its fruit .
what man is there who has pledged to be married a wife , and has not taken her ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her . "
the officers shall speak further to the people , and they shall say , " What man is there who is fearful and fain@@ the@@ ar@@ ted ? let him go and return to his house , lest his brother 's heart melt as his heart . "
and when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God delivers it into your hand , you shall strike every male of it with the edge of the sword :
that they not teach you to do after all their ab@@ om@@ inations , which they have done to their gods ; so would you sin against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
all the elders of that city , who are nearest to the sl@@ ain man , shall wash their hands over the hei@@ fer whose neck was broken in the valley ;
and see among the cap@@ tives a beautiful woman , and you have a desire to her , and would take her to you as wife ;
then you shall bring her home to your house ; and she shall s@@ have her head , and p@@ are her nails ;
if a man have a stubborn and rebelli@@ ous son , who will not obey the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and , though they cha@@ sten him , will not listen to them ;
a woman shall not wear men 's clothing , neither shall a man put on women 's clothing ; for whoever does these things is an ab@@ om@@ ination to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
when you build a new house , then you shall make a batt@@ l@@ ement for your roof , that you don '@@ t bring blood on your house , if any man fall from there .
you shall not sow your viney@@ ard with two kinds of seed , lest the whole fruit be forfe@@ ited , the seed which you have s@@ own , and the increase of the viney@@ ard .
you shall make yourselves fring@@ es on the four borders of your cloak , with which you cover yourself .
but to the lady you shall do nothing ; there is in the lady no sin worthy of death : for as when a man rises against his neighbor , and kills him , even so is this matter ;
then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady 's father fifty she@@ k@@ els of silver , and she shall be his wife , because he has hum@@ bled her ; he may not put her away all his days .
you shall not deliver to his master a servant who is escaped from his master to you :
you shall not bring the hire of a pro@@ stitute , or the wages of a dog , into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God for any vo@@ w : for even both these are an ab@@ om@@ ination to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
you shall not lend on interest to your brother ; interest of money , interest of food , interest of anything that is lent on interest :
to a foreigner you may lend on interest ; but to your brother you shall not lend on interest , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God may bless you in all that you put your hand to , in the land where you go in to possess it .
when you shall vo@@ w a vo@@ w to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , you shall not be slack to pay it : for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God will surely require it of you ; and it would be sin in you .
that which is gone out of your lips you shall observe and do ; according as you have vowed to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , a fre@@ e@@ will offering , which you have promised with your mouth .
if the latter husband hate her , and write her a bill of divorce , and give it in her hand , and send her out of his house ; or if the latter husband die , who took her to be his wife ;
when you do lend your neighbor any kind of loan , you shall not go into his house to get his pledge .
you shall stand outside , and the man to whom you do lend shall bring forth the pledge outside to you .
you shall surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goes down , that he may sleep in his garment , and bless you : and it shall be righteousness to you before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
you shall not op@@ press a hired servant who is poor and ne@@ edy , whether he be of your brothers , or of your foreigners who are in your land within your gates :
when you reap your harvest in your field , and have forgot a she@@ af in the field , you shall not go again to get it : it shall be for the foreigner , for the fa@@ ther@@ less , and for the widow ; that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God may bless you in all the work of your hands .
when you harvest your viney@@ ard , you shall not g@@ lean it after yourselves : it shall be for the foreigner , for the fa@@ ther@@ less , and for the widow .
you shall have a perfect and just weight . you shall have a perfect and just measure , that your days may be long in the land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you .
therefore it shall be , when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God has given you rest from all your enemies all around , in the land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it , that you shall b@@ lot out the memory of A@@ mal@@ ek from under the sky ; you shall not forget .
now , behold , I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground , which you , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have given me . " you shall set it down before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and worship before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
you shall rejoice in all the good which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God has given to you , and to your house , you , and the Lev@@ ite , and the foreigner who is in the midst of you .
look down from your holy hab@@ itation , from heaven , and bless your people Israel , and the ground which you have given us , as you s@@ wore to our fathers , a land flowing with milk and honey . "
this day Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God commands you to do these statutes and ordin@@ ances : you shall therefore keep and do them with all your heart , and with all your soul .
there you shall build an altar to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , an altar of stones : you shall lift up no iron on them .
you shall build the altar of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God of un@@ cut stones ; and you shall offer burnt offerings there@@ on to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God :
and you shall sacrifice peace offerings , and shall eat there ; and you shall rejoice before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
'@@ Cur@@ sed is he who lies with his sister , the daughter of his father , or the daughter of his mother . ' all the people shall say , ' A@@ men . '
'@@ Cur@@ sed is he who strikes his neighbor in secret . ' all the people shall say , ' A@@ men . '
and all these blessings shall come on you , and over@@ take you , if you shall listen to the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
you shall be blessed in the fruit of your body , the fruit of your ground , the fruit of your animals , the increase of your livestock , and the young of your flock .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be struck before you . they will come out against you one way , and will flee before you seven ways .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will command the blessing on you in your bar@@ ns , and in all that you put your hand to ; and he will bless you in the land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you .
but it shall come to pass , if you will not listen to the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command you this day , that all these cur@@ ses shall come on you , and over@@ take you .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will make the pesti@@ l@@ ence cling to you , until he has consumed you from off the land , where you go in to possess it .
the fruit of your ground , and all your lab@@ ors , shall a nation which you don '@@ t know eat up ; and you shall be only oppressed and crushed always ;
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will strike you in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore boil , of which you can not be healed , from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will bring you , and your king whom you shall set over you , to a nation that you have not known , you nor your fathers ; and there you shall serve other gods , wood and stone .
you shall have olive trees throughout all your borders , but you shall not ano@@ int yourself with the oil ; for your oli@@ ves shall drop off .
you shall father sons and daughters , but they shall not be yours ; for they shall go into cap@@ tivity .
all these cur@@ ses shall come on you , and shall pursue you , and over@@ take you , until you are destroyed ; because you did@@ n '@@ t listen to the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded you :
therefore you shall serve your enemies whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall send against you , in hunger , and in thirst , and in n@@ ak@@ edness , and in want of all things : and he shall put a y@@ oke of iron on your neck , until he has destroyed you .
you shall eat the fruit of your own body , the flesh of your sons and of your daughters , whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God has given you , in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies shall distress you .
the man who is tender among you , and very delicate , his eye shall be evil toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bos@@ om , and toward the remn@@ ant of his children whom he has remaining ;
so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat , because he has nothing left him , in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in all your gates .
among these nations you shall find no ease , and there shall be no rest for the sole of your foot : but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will give you there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and p@@ ining of soul ;
your little ones , your wives , and your foreigner who is in the midst of your camps , from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water ;
it shall happen , when all these things have come on you , the blessing and the curse , which I have set before you , and you shall call them to mind among all the nations , where Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God has driven you ,
and shall return to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and shall obey his voice according to all that I command you this day , you and your children , with all your heart , and with all your soul ;
and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed , and you shall possess it ; and he will do you good , and multiply you above your fathers .
it is not in heaven , that you should say , " Who shall go up for us to heaven , and bring it to us , and make us to hear it , that we may do it ? "
but the word is very near to you , in your mouth , and in your heart , that you may do it .
assemble the people , the men and the women and the little ones , and your foreigner who is within your gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and observe to do all the words of this law ;
I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have worked , in that they are turned to other gods .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h saw and ab@@ hor@@ red , because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters .
" see now that I , even I , am he , There is no god with me . I kill , and I make alive . I wound , and I heal . there is no one who can deliver out of my hand .
because you t@@ resp@@ assed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of M@@ eri@@ ba@@ h of Kad@@ esh , in the wilderness of Z@@ in ; because you did@@ n '@@ t sancti@@ fy me in the midst of the children of Israel .
for you shall see the land before you ; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the children of Israel . "
yes , he loves the people . all his saints are in your hand . they sat down at your feet ; each receives your words .
of Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n he said , " Re@@ jo@@ ice , Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n , in your going out ; and Is@@ sac@@ har , in your tents .
of Ash@@ er he said , " Ash@@ er is blessed with children . let him be acceptable to his brothers . let him dip his foot in oil .
Israel d@@ wells in safety ; the fountain of Jacob alone , In a land of grain and new wine . yes , his heavens drop down de@@ w .
you are happy , Israel . who is like you , a people saved by Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the shield of your help , the sword of your excell@@ ency ! your enemies shall submit themselves to you . you shall t@@ read on their high places . "
no man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life . as I was with Moses , so I will be with you . I will not fail you nor for@@ sake you .
whoever rebels against your commandment , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t listen to your words in all that you command him , he shall be put to death . only be strong and courageous . "
as soon as we had heard it , our hearts melted , neither did there remain any more spirit in any man , because of you : for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , he is God in heaven above , and on earth beneath .
at that time , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Joshua , " Make fl@@ int kni@@ ves , and circum@@ c@@ ise again the children of Israel the second time . "
he said , " No ; but I have come now as commander of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's army . " Joshua fell on his face to the earth , and wor@@ shipped , and said to him , " What does my lord say to his servant ? "
Joshua t@@ ore his clothes , and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h until the evening , he and the elders of Israel ; and they put dust on their heads .
therefore the children of Israel can '@@ t stand before their enemies . they turn their backs before their enemies , because they have become devoted for destruction . I will not be with you any more , unless you destroy the devoted things from among you .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Joshua , " Don '@@ t be afraid , neither be dis@@ may@@ ed . take all the people of war with you , and arise , go up to A@@ i . behold , I have given into your hand the king of A@@ i , with his people , his city , and his land .
the amb@@ ush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand , and entered into the city , and took it . they hur@@ ried and set the city on fire .
for Joshua did@@ n '@@ t draw back his hand , with which he stretched out the javelin , until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of A@@ i .
only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey to themselves , according to the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h which he commanded Joshua .
they also resorted to a r@@ use , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old s@@ acks on their don@@ keys , and win@@ es@@ kins , old and torn and bound up ,
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Joshua , " Don '@@ t fear them , for I have delivered them into your hands . not a man of them will stand before you . "
that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Mak@@ k@@ ed@@ ah in peace . none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel .
with him the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites and the G@@ ad@@ ites received their inheritance , which Moses gave them , beyond the Jordan eastward , even as Moses the servant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h gave them :
nevertheless , my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt ; but I wholly followed Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h my God .
Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph , even to E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and to Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , saying , " You are a great people , and have great power . you shall not have one lot only ;
appoint for yourselves three men from each tribe . I will send them , and they shall arise , walk through the land , and describe it according to their inheritance ; and they shall come to me .
they shall divide it into seven portions . Jud@@ ah shall live in his borders on the south , and the house of Joseph shall live in their borders on the north .
the children of Israel gave to the Lev@@ ites out of their inheritance , according to the commandment of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , these cities with their suburbs .
and said to them , " You have kept all that Moses the servant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h commanded you , and have listened to my voice in all that I commanded you .
you have not left your brothers these many days to this day , but have performed the duty of the commandment of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
so Joshua blessed them , and sent them away ; and they went to their tents .
Joshua said to the people , " You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h yourselves , to serve him . " they said , " We are witnesses . "
Ad@@ oni @@@ -@@ @ B@@ ez@@ ek said , " S@@ event@@ y kings , having their thum@@ bs and their great toes cut off , sc@@ av@@ eng@@ ed under my table : as I have done , so God has requ@@ ited me . " they brought him to Jerusalem , and he died there .
and they took their daughters to be their wives , and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods .
the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and forgot Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God , and served the Ba@@ als and the Ash@@ ero@@ th .
he gathered to him the children of Am@@ mon and A@@ mal@@ ek ; and he went and struck Israel , and they possessed the city of palm trees .
Ehud made him a sword which had two edges , a cub@@ it in length ; and he wore it under his clothing on his right thi@@ gh .
but he himself turned back from the quar@@ ries that were by Gil@@ gal , and said , " I have a secret err@@ and to you , king . " the king said , " Keep silence ! " all who stood by him went out from him .
Ehud came to him ; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room . Ehud said , " I have a message from God to you . " he arose out of his seat .
Ehud put forth his left hand , and took the sword from his right thi@@ gh , and thrust it into his body :
she lived under the palm tree of De@@ bor@@ ah between Ram@@ ah and Be@@ the@@ l in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment .
S@@ is@@ era gathered together all his ch@@ ari@@ ots , even nine hundred ch@@ ari@@ ots of iron , and all the people who were with him , from Har@@ osh@@ eth of the Genti@@ les , to the river K@@ ish@@ on .
'A@@ wake , awake , De@@ bor@@ ah ! awake , awake , utter a song ! arise , Bar@@ ak , and lead away your cap@@ tives , you son of Ab@@ ino@@ am . '
Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n was a people that jeopardi@@ zed their lives to the deaths ; N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i also , on the high places of the field .
for they came up with their livestock and their tents ; they came in as lo@@ cu@@ sts for multitude ; both they and their cam@@ els were without number : and they came into the land to destroy it .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h looked at him , and said , " Go in this your might , and save Israel from the hand of Mi@@ dian . haven '@@ t I sent you ? "
please don '@@ t go away , until I come to you , and bring out my present , and lay it before you . " he said , " I will wait until you come back . "
so he brought down the people to the water ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to G@@ ide@@ on , " Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue , like a dog laps , you shall set him by himself ; likewise everyone who b@@ ows down on his knees to drink . "
so the people took food in their hand , and their trum@@ pets ; and he sent all the men of Israel every man to his tent , but retained the three hundred men : and the camp of Mi@@ dian was beneath him in the valley .
he came to the men of S@@ uc@@ co@@ th , and said , " See Ze@@ ba@@ h and Z@@ al@@ mun@@ na , concerning whom you ta@@ un@@ ted me , saying , ' Are the hands of Ze@@ ba@@ h and Z@@ al@@ mun@@ na now in your hand , that we should give bread to your men who are weary ? ' "
so Mi@@ dian was subdued before the children of Israel , and they lifted up their heads no more . the land had rest forty years in the days of G@@ ide@@ on .
he went to his father 's house at O@@ ph@@ rah , and killed his brothers the sons of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al , being seventy persons , on one stone : but Jo@@ th@@ am the youngest son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al was left ; for he hid himself .
when they told it to Jo@@ th@@ am , he went and stood on the top of Mount Ger@@ iz@@ im , and lifted up his voice , and cried , and said to them , " List@@ en to me , you men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , that God may listen to you .
" the br@@ am@@ ble said to the trees , ' If in truth you ano@@ int me king over you , then come and take refuge in my shade ; and if not , let fire come out of the br@@ am@@ ble , and dev@@ our the c@@ ed@@ ars of Lebanon . '
that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al might come , and that their blood might be laid on Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h their brother , who killed them , and on the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers .
Ga@@ al the son of E@@ bed came with his brothers , and went over to Sh@@ ec@@ hem ; and the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem put their trust in him .
he sent messengers to Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h cra@@ f@@ tily , saying , " Be@@ hold , Ga@@ al the son of E@@ bed and his brothers have come to Sh@@ ec@@ hem ; and behold , they incite the city against you .
they put away the foreign gods from among them , and served Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and his soul was griev@@ ed for the misery of Israel .
then J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah fled from his brothers , and lived in the land of To@@ b : and there were gathered vain fellows to J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah , and they went out with him .
the elders of Gil@@ e@@ ad said to J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall be witness between us ; surely according to your word so will we do . "
then J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah went with the elders of Gil@@ e@@ ad , and the people made him head and chief over them : and J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah spoke all his words before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h .
but Si@@ hon did@@ n '@@ t trust Israel to pass through his border ; but Si@@ hon gathered all his people together , and enc@@ amped in Ja@@ haz , and fought against Israel .
J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah came to M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h to his house ; and behold , his daughter came out to meet him with t@@ amb@@ our@@ ines and with dances : and she was his only child ; besides her he had neither son nor daughter .
he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , " I have seen a woman in Tim@@ n@@ ah of the daughters of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : now therefore get her for me as wife . "
then went Sam@@ son down , and his father and his mother , to Tim@@ n@@ ah , and came to the vineyards of Tim@@ n@@ ah : and behold , a young lion ro@@ ared against him .
the Spirit of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came mi@@ gh@@ tily on him , and he t@@ ore him as he would have torn a young goat ; and he had nothing in his hand : but he did@@ n '@@ t tell his father or his mother what he had done .
he took it into his hands , and went on , eating as he went ; and he came to his father and mother , and gave to them , and they ate : but he did@@ n '@@ t tell them that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion .
he found a fresh j@@ aw@@ bone of a don@@ key , and put forth his hand , and took it , and struck a thousand men there@@ with .
he was very thir@@ sty , and called on Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and said , " You have given this great deliver@@ ance by the hand of your servant ; and now shall I die for thirst , and fall into the hand of the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised ? "
the man Mic@@ ah had a house of gods , and he made an ep@@ ho@@ d , and ter@@ ap@@ him , and consec@@ rated one of his sons , who became his priest .
they came to their brothers to Zor@@ ah and E@@ sh@@ ta@@ ol : and their brothers said to them , " What do you say ? "
he said , " You have taken away my gods which I made , and the priest , and have gone away , and what more do I have ? how then do you say to me , ' What ails you ? ' "
the children of Dan went their way : and when Mic@@ ah saw that they were too strong for him , he turned and went back to his house .
the children of Dan set up for themselves the engra@@ ved image : and Jonathan , the son of Ger@@ sh@@ om , the son of Moses , he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Dan@@ ites until the day of the cap@@ tivity of the land .
so they set them up Mic@@ ah 's engra@@ ved image which he made , all the time that God 's house was in Sh@@ il@@ oh .
behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening : now the man was of the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and he lived in Gi@@ be@@ ah ; but the men of the place were Ben@@ jam@@ ites .
yet there is both straw and pro@@ ven@@ der for our don@@ keys ; and there is bread and wine also for me , and for your hand@@ maid , and for the young man who is with your servants : there is no want of anything . "
so he brought him into his house , and gave the don@@ keys fodder ; and they washed their feet , and ate and drink .
all the people arose as one man , saying , " N@@ one of us will go to his tent , neither will any of us turn to his house .
the children of Israel griev@@ ed for Benjamin their brother , and said , " There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day .
the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wives , according to their number , of those who danced , whom they carried off . they went and returned to their inheritance , built the cities , and lived in them .
the children of Israel departed there at that time , every man to his tribe and to his family , and they went out from there every man to his inheritance .
Na@@ omi said to her two daughters @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , " Go , return each of you to her mother 's house : Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h deal kindly with you , as you have dealt with the dead , and with me .
she said , " Be@@ hold , your sister @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law has gone back to her people , and to her god . follow your sister @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law . "
then Bo@@ az said to his servant who was set over the re@@ apers , " Wh@@ ose young lady is this ? "
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said to him , " Why have I found favor in your sight , that you should take knowledge of me , since I am a foreigner ? "
then she said , " Let me find favor in your sight , my lord , because you have comfor@@ ted me , and because you have spoken kindly to your hand@@ maid , though I am not as one of your hand@@ mai@@ dens . "
she took it up , and went into the city ; and her mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law saw what she had g@@ leaned : and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she was suff@@ iced .
therefore wash yourself , ano@@ int yourself , get dressed , and go down to the thresh@@ ing floor , but don '@@ t make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking .
she said , " He gave me these six measures of barley ; for he said , ' Don '@@ t go empty to your mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law . ' "
the near kin@@ sman said , " I can '@@ t re@@ deem it for myself , lest I mar my own inheritance . take my right of redemption for yourself ; for I can '@@ t re@@ deem it . "
now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning re@@ deem@@ ing and concerning exchanging , to confirm all things : a man took off his shoe , and gave it to his neighbor ; and this was the way of att@@ est@@ ation in Israel .
so the near kin@@ sman said to Bo@@ az , " Buy it for yourself . " he took off his shoe .
this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies in Sh@@ il@@ oh . the two sons of El@@ i , Hop@@ hn@@ i and Ph@@ ine@@ has , priests to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , were there .
El@@ kan@@ ah her husband said to her , " Hann@@ ah , why do you we@@ ep ? why don '@@ t you eat ? why is your heart griev@@ ed ? am I not better to you than ten sons ? "
now Hann@@ ah spoke in her heart . only her lips moved , but her voice was not heard . therefore El@@ i thought she had been drun@@ ken .
Don '@@ t count your hand@@ maid for a wicked woman ; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation . "
she said , " Let your hand@@ maid find favor in your sight . " so the woman went her way , and ate ; and her facial expression was@@ n '@@ t sad any more .
they rose up in the morning early , and worshi@@ ped before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and returned , and came to their house to Ram@@ ah : and El@@ kan@@ ah knew Hann@@ ah his wife ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h remembered her .
there is no one as holy as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , For there is no one besides you , nor is there any rock like our God .
the custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice , the priest 's servant came , while the flesh was boiling , with a for@@ k of three teeth in his hand ;
and he struck it into the pan , or kettle , or cal@@ dr@@ on , or pot ; all that the for@@ k brought up the priest took there@@ with . so they did in Sh@@ il@@ oh to all the Israel@@ ites who came there .
moreover his mother made him a little robe , and brought it to him from year to year , when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice .
behold , the days come , that I will cut off your arm , and the arm of your father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in your house .
I will raise me up a faithful priest , that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind . I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before my ano@@ inted forever .
when they of Ash@@ do@@ d arose early on the next day , behold , D@@ agon was fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . they took D@@ agon , and set him in his place again .
Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life .
he said , " This will be the way of the king who shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them to him , for his ch@@ ari@@ ots , and to be his hor@@ sem@@ en ; and they shall run before his ch@@ ari@@ ots ;
he will take the tenth of your seed , and of your vineyards , and give to his officers , and to his servants .
he had a son , whose name was Saul , an impressive young man ; and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he . from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people .
the don@@ keys of K@@ ish , Saul 's father , were lost . K@@ ish said to Saul his son , " Take now one of the servants with you , and arise , go seek the don@@ keys . "
when Samuel saw Saul , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to him , " Be@@ hold , the man of whom I spoke to you ! this same shall have authority over my people . "
Samuel answered Saul , and said , " I am the se@@ er . go up before me to the high place , for you shall eat with me today . in the morning I will let you go , and will tell you all that is in your heart .
Samuel said to the cook , " B@@ ring the portion which I gave you , of which I said to you , ' Set it aside . ' "
Saul said to his uncle , " He told us plainly that the don@@ keys were found . " but concerning the matter of the kingdom , of which Samuel spoke , he did@@ n '@@ t tell him .
they ran and fetched him there ; and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward .
Saul also went to his house to Gi@@ be@@ ah ; and there went with him the army , whose hearts God had touched .
now , behold , the king walks before you ; and I am old and gray @@@ -@@ @ headed ; and behold , my sons are with you : and I have walked before you from my youth to this day .
" but they forgot Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God ; and he sold them into the hand of S@@ is@@ era , captain of the army of Haz@@ or , and into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and into the hand of the king of Mo@@ ab ; and they fought against them .
all the people said to Samuel , " Pr@@ ay for your servants to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , that we not die ; for we have added to all our sins this evil , to ask us a king . "
for , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , who saves Israel , though it is in Jonathan my son , he shall surely die . " but there was not a man among all the people who answered him .
then he said to all Israel , " You be on one side , and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side . " the people said to Saul , " Do what seems good to you . "
there was severe war against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines all the days of Saul : and when Saul saw any mighty man , or any val@@ i@@ ant man , he took him to him .
Saul said , " They have brought them from the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites ; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the cattle , to sacrifice to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God . we have utterly destroyed the rest . "
Samuel said , " Th@@ ough you were little in your own sight , wer@@ en '@@ t you made the head of the tribes of Israel ? Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ano@@ inted you king over Israel ;
then he said , " I have sin@@ ned : yet please honor me now before the elders of my people , and before Israel , and come back with me , that I may worship Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God . "
Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death ; for Samuel mour@@ ned for Saul : and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h griev@@ ed that he had made Saul king over Israel .
let our lord now command your servants who are before you , to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the har@@ p . it shall happen , when the evil spirit from God is on you , that he shall play with his hand , and you shall be well . "
Saul sent to Jes@@ se , saying , " Please let David stand before me ; for he has found favor in my sight . "
now the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered together their armies to battle ; and they were gathered together at Soc@@ oh , which belongs to Jud@@ ah , and enc@@ amped between Soc@@ oh and A@@ ze@@ k@@ ah , in E@@ ph@@ es@@ dam@@ mi@@ m .
now David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father 's sheep at Bethlehem .
David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage , and ran to the army , and came and greeted his brothers .
David said to Saul , " Your servant was keeping his father 's sheep ; and when a lion or a bear came , and took a lamb out of the flock ,
David put his hand in his bag , took a stone , and sl@@ ung it , and struck the Phil@@ ist@@ ine in his forehead ; and the stone sank into his forehead , and he fell on his face to the earth .
David took the head of the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and brought it to Jerusalem ; but he put his armor in his tent .
Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him , and gave it to David , and his clothing , even to his sword , and to his bow , and to his s@@ ash .
therefore Saul removed him from him , and made him his captain over a thousand ; and he went out and came in before the people .
I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are , and I will talk with my father about you ; and if I see anything , I will tell you . "
Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father , and said to him , " Don '@@ t let the king sin against his servant , against David ; because he has not sin@@ ned against you , and because his works have been very good toward you ;
Saul sent messengers to David 's house , to watch him , and to kill him in the morning . Mic@@ h@@ al , David 's wife , told him , saying , " If you don '@@ t save your life tonight , tomorrow you will be killed . "
Saul said to Mic@@ h@@ al , " Why have you deceived me thus , and let my enemy go , so that he is escaped ? " Mic@@ h@@ al answered Saul , " He said to me , ' Let me go ! why should I kill you ? ' "
he also stripped off his clothes , and he also prophe@@ si@@ ed before Samuel , and lay down naked all that day and all that night . therefore they say , " Is Saul also among the prophets ? "
David fled from Nai@@ o@@ th in Ram@@ ah , and came and said before Jonathan , " What have I done ? what is my ini@@ qu@@ ity ? what is my sin before your father , that he seeks my life ? "
then Jonathan said to David , " Wh@@ at@@ ever your soul desires , I will even do it for you . "
but also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever ; no , not when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has cut off the enemies of David everyone from the surface of the earth . "
when the boy had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot , Jonathan cried after the boy , and said , " is@@ n '@@ t the arrow beyond you ? "
as soon as the boy was gone , David arose out of the south , and fell on his face to the ground , and bowed himself three times . they kis@@ sed one another , and we@@ pt one with another , and David we@@ pt the most .
David said to A@@ him@@ elec@@ h , " is@@ n '@@ t there here under your hand spe@@ ar or sword ? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me , because the king 's business required ha@@ ste . "
David laid up these words in his heart , and was very afraid of Ach@@ ish the king of G@@ ath .
then Ach@@ ish said to his servants , " Look , you see the man is mad . why then have you brought him to me ?
Saul said to his servants who stood about him , " He@@ ar now , you Ben@@ jam@@ ites ! will the son of Jes@@ se give everyone of you fields and vineyards , will he make you all cap@@ tains of thousands and cap@@ tains of hundreds ,
it happened , when A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the son of A@@ him@@ elec@@ h fled to David to Ke@@ il@@ ah , that he came down with an ep@@ ho@@ d in his hand .
they both made a covenant before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : and David stayed in the woods , and Jonathan went to his house .
so David checked his men with these words , and did@@ n '@@ t allow them to rise against Saul . Saul rose up out of the cave , and went on his way .
swear now therefore to me by Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that you will not cut off my seed after me , and that you will not destroy my name out of my father 's house . "
David s@@ wore to Saul . Saul went home ; but David and his men went up to the strongh@@ old .
there was a man in Ma@@ on , whose possessions were in Car@@ me@@ l ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand sheep , and a thousand goats : and he was sh@@ earing his sheep in Car@@ me@@ l .
David heard in the wilderness that Nab@@ al was sh@@ earing his sheep .
Nab@@ al answered David 's servants , and said , " Who is David ? who is the son of Jes@@ se ? there are many servants who break away from their masters these days .
when Ab@@ ig@@ ail saw David , she hur@@ ried , and ali@@ ghted from her don@@ key , and fell before David on her face , and bowed herself to the ground .
please forgive the t@@ resp@@ ass of your hand@@ maid . for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will certainly make my lord a sure house , because my lord fights the battles of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and evil shall not be found in you all your days .
blessed is your discretion , and blessed are you , that have kept me this day from blood guil@@ t@@ iness , and from av@@ eng@@ ing myself with my own hand .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will render to every man his righteousness and his faith@@ fulness ; because Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h delivered you into my hand today , and I w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t put forth my hand against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's ano@@ inted .
behold , as your life was respected this day in my eyes , so let my life be respected in the eyes of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and let him deliver me out of all oppression . "
it happened in those days , that the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered their armies together for warfare , to fight with Israel . Ach@@ ish said to David , " Know assu@@ re@@ dly that you shall go out with me in the army , you and your men . "
David said to Ach@@ ish , " T@@ herefore you shall know what your servant will do . " Ach@@ ish said to David , " T@@ herefore will I make you my body@@ guard for ever . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has done to you as he spoke by me . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has torn the kingdom out of your hand , and given it to your neighbor , even to David .
now therefore , please listen also to the voice of your hand@@ maid , and let me set a mor@@ sel of bread before you ; and eat , that you may have strength , when you go on your way . "
now the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered together all their armies to Ap@@ he@@ k : and the Israel@@ ites enc@@ amped by the spring which is in J@@ ez@@ re@@ el .
David said to A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the priest , the son of A@@ him@@ elec@@ h , " Please bring me here the ep@@ ho@@ d . " A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar brought the ep@@ ho@@ d to David .
they cut off his head , and stripped off his armor , and sent into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines all around , to carry the news to the house of their idols , and to the people .
then David took hold on his clothes , and t@@ ore them ; and likewise all the men who were with him .
now therefore let your hands be strong , and be val@@ i@@ ant ; for Saul your lord is dead , and also the house of Jud@@ ah have ano@@ inted me king over them . "
Ab@@ ner said to him , " Turn aside to your right hand or to your left , and grab one of the young men , and take his armor . " but As@@ ah@@ el would not turn aside from following him .
Jo@@ ab said , " As God lives , if you had not spoken , surely then in the morning the people would have gone away , and not each followed his brother . "
Ab@@ ner sent messengers to David on his behalf , saying , " Wh@@ ose is the land ? " and saying , " Make your alliance with me , and behold , my hand shall be with you , to bring all Israel around to you . "
in He@@ br@@ on he re@@ igned over Jud@@ ah seven years and six months ; and in Jerusalem he re@@ igned thirty @@@ -@@ @ three years over all Israel and Jud@@ ah .
when they came to the thresh@@ ing floor of N@@ acon , Uz@@ z@@ ah reached for the ark of God , and took hold of it ; for the cattle stum@@ bled .
it was so , as the ark of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came into the city of David , that Mic@@ h@@ al the daughter of Saul looked out at the window , and saw king David le@@ aping and dancing before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and she desp@@ ised him in her heart .
David said to Mic@@ h@@ al , " It was before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , who chose me above your father , and above all his house , to appoint me prince over the people of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , over Israel . therefore will I celebrate before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel . I will cause you to rest from all your enemies . moreover Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h tells you that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will make you a house .
when your days are fulfilled , and you shall sleep with your fathers , I will set up your seed after you , who shall proceed out of your bow@@ els , and I will establish his kingdom .
but my loving kindness shall not depart from him , as I took it from Saul , whom I put away before you .
therefore you are great , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h God . for there is none like you , neither is there any God besides you , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
David earned a reputation when he returned from sm@@ iting the Syrians in the Valley of Salt , even eighteen thousand men .
M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth , the son of Jonathan , the son of Saul , came to David , and fell on his face , and showed respect . David said , " M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth . " he answered , " Be@@ hold , your servant ! "
then Zi@@ ba said to the king , " According to all that my lord the king commands his servant , so your shall servant do . " so M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth ate at the king 's table , like one of the king 's sons .
it happened , at the return of the year , at the time when kings go out , that David sent Jo@@ ab , and his servants with him , and all Israel ; and they destroyed the children of Am@@ mon , and be@@ sieg@@ ed Rab@@ ba@@ h . but David stayed at Jerusalem .
David sent messengers , and took her ; and she came in to him , and he lay with her ( for she was purified from her un@@ clean@@ ness ) ; and she returned to her house .
David said to Uri@@ ah , " Go down to your house , and wash your feet . " Uri@@ ah departed out of the king 's house , and a gift from the king was sent after him .
when David had called him , he ate and drink before him ; and he made him drunk . at evening , he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord , but did@@ n '@@ t go down to his house .
the shooters shot at your servants from off the wall ; and some of the king 's servants are dead , and your servant Uri@@ ah the Hit@@ tite is dead also . "
when the wife of Uri@@ ah heard that Uri@@ ah her husband was dead , she made lam@@ entation for her husband .
but when David saw that his servants were whis@@ pering together , David perceived that the child was dead ; and David said to his servants , " Is the child dead ? " they said , " He is dead . "
David comfor@@ ted Bath@@ she@@ ba his wife , and went in to her , and lay with her . she bore a son , and he called his name Solomon . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h loved him ;
then Am@@ non hated her with exceeding great hatred ; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her . Am@@ non said to her , " A@@ rise , be gone ! "
then he called his servant who minist@@ ered to him , and said , " P@@ ut now this woman out from me , and bolt the door after her . "
Tam@@ ar put ashes on her head , and t@@ ore her garment of various colors that was on her ; and she laid her hand on her head , and went her way , crying aloud as she went .
Ab@@ sal@@ om came to the king , and said , " See now , your servant has she@@ ep@@ sh@@ ear@@ ers . please let the king and his servants go with your servant . "
the servants of Ab@@ sal@@ om did to Am@@ non as Ab@@ sal@@ om had commanded . then all the king 's sons arose , and every man got up on his mu@@ le , and fled .
but Ab@@ sal@@ om fled , and went to Tal@@ ma@@ i the son of Am@@ mi@@ hu@@ r , king of G@@ es@@ hu@@ r . David mour@@ ned for his son every day .
when the woman of Te@@ ko@@ a spoke to the king , she fell on her face to the ground , showed respect , and said , " Help , O king ! "
the king said , " Who@@ ever says anything to you , bring him to me , and he shall not touch you any more . "
for the king will hear , to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God .
the king said to Jo@@ ab , " Be@@ hold now , I have done this thing . go therefore , bring the young man Ab@@ sal@@ om back . "
so Jo@@ ab came to the king , and told him ; and when he had called for Ab@@ sal@@ om , he came to the king , and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king kis@@ sed Ab@@ sal@@ om .
the king went forth , and all his household after him . the king left ten women , who were conc@@ ub@@ ines , to keep the house .
whereas you came but yesterday , should I this day make you go up and down with us , since I go where I may ? return , and take back your brothers . mercy and truth be with you . "
David went up by the ascent of the Mount of O@@ lives , and we@@ pt as he went up ; and he had his head covered , and went b@@ are@@ foot : and all the people who were with him covered every man his head , and they went up , we@@ eping as they went up .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has returned on you all the blood of the house of Saul , in whose place you have re@@ igned ! Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Ab@@ sal@@ om your son ! behold , you are caught by your own mis@@ chief , because you are a man of blood ! "
David said to Ab@@ is@@ hai , and to all his servants , " Be@@ hold , my son , who came forth from my bow@@ els , seeks my life . how much more this Ben@@ jam@@ ite , now ? leave him alone , and let him curse ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has invited him .
when A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el saw that his counsel was not followed , he sadd@@ led his don@@ key , and arose , and went home , to his city , and set his house in order , and han@@ ged himself ; and he died , and was buried in the tomb of his father .
there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Zi@@ ba the servant of the house of Saul , and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king .
the king answered , " Ch@@ im@@ ham shall go over with me , and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you . whatever you require of me , that I will do for you . "
all the people went over the Jordan , and the king went over . then the king kis@@ sed Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i , and blessed him ; and he returned to his own place .
David said to Ab@@ is@@ hai , " Now She@@ ba the son of B@@ ich@@ ri will do us more harm than Ab@@ sal@@ om did . take your lord 's servants , and pursue after him , lest he get himself fortified cities , and escape out of our sight . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h thunder@@ ed from heaven . the Most High uttered his voice .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h rewarded me according to my righteousness . he rewarded me according to the clean@@ ness of my hands .
therefore Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has rewarded me according to my righteousness , According to my clean@@ ness in his eye@@ sight .
therefore I will give thanks to you , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , among the nations . will sing pra@@ ises to your name .
Ab@@ is@@ hai , the brother of Jo@@ ab , the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , was chief of the three . he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
" go and speak to David , ' Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " I offer you three things . choose one of them , that I may do it to you . " ' "
when the angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h rel@@ ented of the disaster , and said to the angel who destroyed the people , " It is enough . now stay your hand . " the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was by the thresh@@ ing floor of Ara@@ un@@ ah the Je@@ bus@@ ite .
Ad@@ oni@@ jah killed sheep and cattle and fat@@ lings by the stone of Zo@@ hel@@ eth , which is beside E@@ n Rog@@ el ; and he called all his brothers , the king 's sons , and all the men of Jud@@ ah , the king 's servants :
but Na@@ than the prophet , and Ben@@ aiah , and the mighty men , and Solomon his brother , he did@@ n '@@ t call .
go in to king David , and tell him , ' did@@ n '@@ t you , my lord , king , swear to your hand@@ maid , saying , As@@ su@@ re@@ dly Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne ? why then does Ad@@ oni@@ jah reign ? '
moreover the king 's servants came to bless our lord king David , saying , ' May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name , and make his throne greater than your throne ; ' and the king bowed himself on the bed .
so king Solomon sent , and they brought him down from the altar . he came and bowed down to king Solomon ; and Solomon said to him , " Go to your house . "
David slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of David .
then Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada went up , and fell on him , and killed him ; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness .
Shim@@ ei arose , and sadd@@ led his don@@ key , and went to G@@ ath to Ach@@ ish , to seek his servants ; and Shim@@ ei went , and brought his servants from G@@ ath .
the king said moreover to Shim@@ ei , " You know all the w@@ ick@@ edness which your heart is priv@@ y to , that you did to David my father . therefore Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall return your w@@ ick@@ edness on your own head .
give your servant therefore an understanding heart to judge your people , that I may discern between good and evil ; for who is able to judge this your great people ? "
God said to him , " Because you have asked this thing , and have not asked for yourself long life , neither have asked riches for yourself , nor have asked the life of your enemies , but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice ;
behold , I have done according to your word . behold , I have given you a wise and an understanding heart ; so that there has been none like you before you , neither after you shall any arise like you .
I have also given you that which you have not asked , both riches and honor , so that there shall not be any among the kings like you , all your days .
she arose at midnight , and took my son from beside me , while your hand@@ maid slept , and laid it in her bos@@ om , and laid her dead child in my bos@@ om .
Jud@@ ah and Israel lived safely , every man under his vine and under his fi@@ g tree , from Dan even to Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba , all the days of Solomon .
Hir@@ am king of Ty@@ re sent his servants to Solomon ; for he had heard that they had ano@@ inted him king in the place of his father : for Hir@@ am was ever a lover of David .
" you know how that David my father could not build a house for the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God for the wars which were about him on every side , until Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h put them under the sol@@ es of his feet .
behold , I purpose to build a house for the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h my God , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke to David my father , saying , ' Your son , whom I will set on your throne in your place , he shall build the house for my name . '
he sent them to Lebanon , ten thousand a month by courses ; a month they were in Lebanon , and two months at home ; and Ad@@ on@@ ir@@ am was over the men subject to forced labor .
Solomon was building his own house thirteen years , and he finished all his house .
his house where he was to dwell , the other court within the por@@ ch , was of the like work . he made also a house for Phar@@ aoh 's daughter ( whom Solomon had taken as wife ) , like this por@@ ch .
for he fashioned the two pillars of brass , eighteen cub@@ its high api@@ ece : and a line of twelve cub@@ its en@@ cir@@ cled either of them about .
Solomon stood before the altar of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in the presence of all the assembly of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heaven ;
and he said , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , there is no God like you , in heaven above , or on earth beneath ; who keep covenant and loving kindness with your servants , who walk before you with all their heart ;
listen to the suppl@@ ication of your servant , and of your people Israel , when they shall pray toward this place . yes , hear in heaven , your dwelling place ; and when you hear , forgive .
then hear in heaven , and do , and judge your servants , condemning the wicked , to bring his way on his own head , and justi@@ fying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
" when the sky is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sin@@ ned against you ; if they pray toward this place , and confess your name , and turn from their sin , when you aff@@ l@@ ict them :
" if your people go out to battle against their enemy , by whatever way you shall send them , and they pray to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h toward the city which you have chosen , and toward the house which I have built for your name ;
yet if they shall repent in the land where they are carried captive , and turn again , and make suppl@@ ication to you in the land of those who carried them captive , saying , ' We have sin@@ ned , and have done per@@ vers@@ ely ; we have dealt w@@ ick@@ edly ; '
for you separated them from among all the peoples of the earth , to be your inheritance , as you spoke by Moses your servant , when you brought our fathers out of Egypt , Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
that he may incl@@ ine our hearts to him , to walk in all his ways , and to keep his commandments , and his statutes , and his ordin@@ ances , which he commanded our fathers .
on the eighth day he sent the people away ; and they blessed the king , and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had shown to David his servant , and to Israel his people .
then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have made holy for my name , will I cast out of my sight ; and Israel shall be a prover@@ b and a by@@ word among all peoples .
Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Ge@@ zer , and burnt it with fire , and sl@@ ain the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites who lived in the city , and given it for a portion to his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
Hir@@ am sent in the navy his servants , sailors who had knowledge of the sea , with the servants of Solomon .
she said to the king , " It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts , and of your wisdom .
happy are your men , happy are these your servants , who stand continually before you , who hear your wisdom .
they brought every man his tribute , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and clothing , and armor , and spices , horses , and mul@@ es , a rate year by year .
so he did for all his foreign wives , who burnt inc@@ ense and sacrificed to their gods .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was angry with Solomon , because his heart was turned away from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , who had appeared to him twice ,
therefore Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Solomon , " Because this is done by you , and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes , which I have commanded you , I will surely tear the kingdom from you , and will give it to your servant .
when had@@ ad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers , and that Jo@@ ab the captain of the army was dead , had@@ ad said to Phar@@ aoh , " Let me depart , that I may go to my own country . "
he gathered men to him , and became captain over a troop , when David killed them of Z@@ ob@@ ah : and they went to Damascus , and lived therein , and re@@ igned in Damascus .
to his son will I give one tribe , that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem , the city which I have chosen me to put my name there .
Solomon slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of David his father : and Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am his son re@@ igned in his place .
J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am said in his heart , " Now the kingdom will return to the house of David .
now there lived an old prophet in Be@@ the@@ l ; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Be@@ the@@ l . they also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king .
but came back , and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you , " E@@ at no bread , and drink no water " ; your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers . ' "
take with you ten lo@@ aves , and cakes , and a jar of honey , and go to him . he will tell you what will become of the child . "
and t@@ ore the kingdom away from the house of David , and gave it you ; and yet you have not been as my servant David , who kept my commandments , and who followed me with all his heart , to do that only which was right in my eyes ,
but have done evil above all who were before you , and have gone and made you other gods , and mol@@ ten images , to provoke me to anger , and have cast me behind your back :
Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David : and his mother 's name was Na@@ am@@ ah the Am@@ monit@@ ess . A@@ bi@@ jam his son re@@ igned in his place .
he walked in all the sins of his father , which he had done before him ; and his heart was not perfect with Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God , as the heart of David his father .
Ben had@@ ad listened to king As@@ a , and sent the cap@@ tains of his armies against the cities of Israel , and struck I@@ j@@ on , and Dan , and A@@ bel B@@ eth Ma@@ ac@@ ah , and all Chin@@ ner@@ o@@ th , with all the land of N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin .
the woman said to Elijah , " Now I know that you are a man of God , and that the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in your mouth is truth . "
as Ob@@ adi@@ ah was in the way , behold , Elijah met him : and he recognized him , and fell on his face , and said , " Is it you , my lord Elijah ? "
Elijah said to the prophets of Ba@@ al , " Choose one bull for yourselves , and dress it first ; for you are many ; and call on the name of your god , but put no fire under it . "
when all the people saw it , they fell on their faces . they said , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , he is God ! Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , he is God ! "
so A@@ hab went up to eat and to drink . Elijah went up to the top of Car@@ me@@ l ; and he bowed himself down on the earth , and put his face between his knees .
when he saw that , he arose , and went for his life , and came to Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba , which belongs to Jud@@ ah , and left his servant there .
you shall ano@@ int Je@@ hu the son of N@@ im@@ sh@@ i to be king over Israel ; and you shall ano@@ int Elis@@ ha the son of Sha@@ ph@@ at of A@@ bel Me@@ hol@@ ah to be prophet in your place .
the messengers came again , and said , " Ben had@@ ad says , ' I sent indeed to you , saying , " You shall deliver me your silver , and your gold , and your wives , and your children ;
I will make your house like the house of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , and like the house of Ba@@ asha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger , and have made Israel to sin . "
the king of Israel said to his servants , " You know that Ram@@ o@@ th Gil@@ e@@ ad is ours , and we are still , and don '@@ t take it out of the hand of the king of Syria ? "
now therefore , behold , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken evil concerning you . "
the king of Israel said to Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , " I will disguise myself , and go into the battle ; but you put on your robes . " the king of Israel disguised himself , and went into the battle .
A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah fell down through the lat@@ tice in his upper room that was in Sam@@ aria , and was sick . so he sent messengers , and said to them , " Go , inqu@@ ire of Ba@@ al Ze@@ bu@@ b , the god of Ek@@ ron , whether I will recover of this sickness . "
they answered him , " He was a hair@@ y man , and wearing a leather belt around his waist . " he said , " It is Elijah the T@@ ish@@ bite . "
behold , fire came down from the sky , and consumed the two former cap@@ tains of fifty with their fif@@ ties . but now let my life be precious in your sight . "
Elijah took his mantle , and wrapped it together , and struck the waters , and they were divided here and there , so that they two went over on dry ground .
Elis@@ ha saw it , and he cried , " My father , my father , the ch@@ ari@@ ots of Israel and its hor@@ sem@@ en ! " he saw him no more : and he took hold of his own clothes , and t@@ ore them in two pieces .
they said , " This is blood . the kings are surely destroyed , and they have struck each other . now therefore , Mo@@ ab , to the spoil ! "
when the king of Mo@@ ab saw that the battle was too severe for him , he took with him seven hundred men who drew sword , to break through to the king of E@@ dom ; but they could not .
then he said , " Go , borrow containers from of all your neighbors , even empty containers . Don '@@ t borrow just a few .
so she went from him , and shut the door on her and on her sons ; they brought the containers to her , and she poured out .
she said to her husband , " See now , I perceive that this is a holy man of God , that passes by us continually .
then she said , " Did I desire a son of my lord ? did@@ n '@@ t I say , Do not deceive me ? "
he went in therefore , and shut the door on them both , and prayed to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
then she went in , and fell at his feet , and bowed herself to the ground ; and she took up her son , and went out .
one went out into the field to gather herbs , and found a wild vine , and gathered of it wild gour@@ ds his lap full , and came and sh@@ red them into the pot of ste@@ w ; for they did@@ n '@@ t recognize them .
now Na@@ aman , captain of the army of the king of Syria , was a great man with his master , and honorable , because by him Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had given victory to Syria : he was also a mighty man of val@@ or , but he was a le@@ per .
she said to her mistress , " I wish that my lord were with the prophet who is in Sam@@ aria ! then he would heal him of his le@@ pro@@ sy . "
someone went in , and told his lord , saying , " The mai@@ den who is from the land of Israel said this . "
the king of Syria said , " Go now , and I will send a letter to the king of Israel . " he departed , and took with him ten talents of silver , and six thousand pieces of gold , and ten changes of clothing .
it was so , when Elis@@ ha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes , that he sent to the king , saying , " Why have you torn your clothes ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel . "
Elis@@ ha sent a messenger to him , saying , " Go and wash in the Jordan seven times , and your flesh shall come again to you , and you shall be clean . "
but Na@@ aman was angry , and went away , and said , " Be@@ hold , I thought , ' He will surely come out to me , and stand , and call on the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God , and wave his hand over the place , and heal the le@@ per . '
so Ge@@ haz@@ i followed after Na@@ aman . when Na@@ aman saw one running after him , he came down from the ch@@ ari@@ ot to meet him , and said , " Is all well ? "
but he went in , and stood before his master . Elis@@ ha said to him , " Where did you come from , Ge@@ haz@@ i ? " he said , " Your servant went nowhere . "
he said , " Take it . " so he put out his hand and took it .
the heart of the king of Syria was very troubled about this . he called his servants , and said to them , " W@@ on '@@ t you show me which of us is for the king of Israel ? "
it happened after this , that B@@ enh@@ ad@@ ad king of Syria gathered all his army , and went up and be@@ sieg@@ ed Sam@@ aria .
therefore they arose and fled in the tw@@ ilight , and left their tents , and their horses , and their don@@ keys , even the camp as it was , and fled for their life .
they went after them to the Jordan ; and behold , all the way was full of garments and vessels , which the Syrians had cast away in their ha@@ ste . the messengers returned , and told the king .
then Jor@@ am passed over to Z@@ air , and all his ch@@ ari@@ ots with him : and he rose up by night , and struck the E@@ dom@@ ites who surrounded him , and the cap@@ tains of the ch@@ ari@@ ots ; and the people fled to their tents .
Jor@@ am slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David ; and A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah his son re@@ igned in his place .
Elis@@ ha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets , and said to him , " P@@ ut your belt on your waist , take this vial of oil in your hand , and go to Ram@@ o@@ th Gil@@ e@@ ad .
when he came , behold , the cap@@ tains of the army were sitting . then he said , " I have a message for you , captain . " Je@@ hu said , " To which of us all ? " he said , " To you , O captain . "
Je@@ hu drew his bow with his full strength , and struck Jor@@ am between his arms ; and the arrow went out at his heart , and he sunk down in his ch@@ ari@@ ot .
when Je@@ hu had come to J@@ ez@@ re@@ el , J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel heard of it ; and she painted her eyes , and at@@ tired her head , and looked out at the window .
he lifted up his face to the window , and said , " Who is on my side ? who ? " two or three e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s looked out at him .
select the best and fit@@ test of your master 's sons , set him on his father 's throne , and fight for your master 's house . "
in the seventh year Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada sent and fetched the cap@@ tains over hundreds of the Car@@ ites and of the guard , and brought them to him into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and he made a covenant with them , and took an oath of them in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and showed them the king 's son .
the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the altar and the house , around the king .
Je@@ ho@@ ash did that which was right in the eyes of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h all his days in which Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the priest instructed him .
( Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h gave Israel a s@@ avi@@ or , so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians ; and the children of Israel lived in their tents as before .
he said to the king of Israel , " P@@ ut your hand on the bow " ; and he put his hand on it . Elis@@ ha laid his hands on the king 's hands .
but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was gr@@ acious to them , and had compassion on them , and had respect to them , because of his covenant with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and would not destroy them , neither cast he them from his presence as yet .
it happened , as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand , that he killed his servants who had sl@@ ain the king his father :
Jud@@ ah was defeated by Israel ; and they fled every man to his tent .
he built El@@ ath , and restored it to Jud@@ ah , after that the king slept with his fathers .
J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am slept with his fathers , even with the kings of Israel ; and Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah his son re@@ igned in his place .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : he did@@ n '@@ t depart all his days from the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , with which he made Israel to sin .
Pe@@ k@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah , his captain , con@@ spi@@ red against him , and struck him in Sam@@ aria , in the castle of the king 's house , with Ar@@ go@@ b and Ari@@ eh ; and with him were fifty men of the Gil@@ e@@ ad@@ ites : and he killed him , and re@@ igned in his place .
Jo@@ th@@ am slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father : and A@@ haz his son re@@ igned in his place .
he burnt his burnt offering and his meal offering , and poured his drink offering , and sprink@@ led the blood of his peace offerings , on the altar .
it was so , because the children of Israel had sin@@ ned against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God , who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt , and had feared other gods ,
the children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God : and they built them high places in all their cities , from the tower of the watch@@ men to the fortified city ;
and they set them up pillars and Ash@@ eri@@ m on every high hill , and under every green tree ;
notwithstanding , they would not listen , but hardened their neck , like the neck of their fathers , who did@@ n '@@ t believe in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God .
they for@@ s@@ ook all the commandments of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God , and made them mol@@ ten images , even two cal@@ ves , and made an Ash@@ er@@ ah , and worshi@@ ped all the army of the sky , and served Ba@@ al .
they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire , and used div@@ ination and enchan@@ tments , and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to provoke him to anger .
therefore Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was very angry with Israel , and removed them out of his sight : there was none left but the tribe of Jud@@ ah only .
until Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h removed Israel out of his sight , as he spoke by all his servants the prophets . so Israel was carried away out of their own land to As@@ sy@@ ria to this day .
and the Av@@ v@@ ites made Ni@@ b@@ haz and Tar@@ ta@@ k ; and the Sep@@ harv@@ ites burnt their children in the fire to A@@ dram@@ m@@ elec@@ h and An@@ amm@@ elec@@ h , the gods of Sep@@ harv@@ aim .
so they feared Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and made to them from among themselves priests of the high places , who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places .
then Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of Hil@@ ki@@ ah , and She@@ b@@ n@@ ah , and Jo@@ ah , said to Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h , " Please speak to your servants in the Syrian language ; for we understand it . Don '@@ t speak with us in the Jews ' language , in the hearing of the people who are on the wall . "
Don '@@ t listen to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah . ' for thus says the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , ' Make your peace with me , and come out to me ; and everyone of you eat of his vine , and everyone of his fi@@ g tree , and everyone drink the waters of his own ci@@ stern ;
who are they among all the gods of the countries , that have delivered their country out of my hand , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand ? ' "
it happened , when king He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah heard it , that he t@@ ore his clothes , and covered himself with s@@ ack@@ cloth , and went into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
this is the word that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken concerning him : " the virgin daughter of Z@@ ion has desp@@ ised you and ridicul@@ ed you . the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you .
'@@ For I will defend this city to save it , for my own sake , and for my servant David 's sake . ' "
then he turned his face to the wall , and prayed to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , saying ,
" turn back , and tell He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah the prince of my people , ' Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of David your father , " I have heard your prayer . I have seen your tears . behold , I will heal you . on the third day , you shall go up to the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
I will add to your days fifteen years . I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria . I will defend this city for my own sake , and for my servant David 's sake . " ' "
he said , " What have they seen in your house ? " He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah answered , " They have seen all that is in my house . there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them . "
" because Man@@ as@@ se@@ h king of Jud@@ ah has done these ab@@ om@@ inations , and has done w@@ ick@@ edly above all that the A@@ mor@@ ites did , who were before him , and has made Jud@@ ah also to sin with his idols ;
he de@@ filed T@@ oph@@ eth , which is in the valley of the children of H@@ inno@@ m , that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Mol@@ ech .
for through the anger of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , it happened in Jerusalem and Jud@@ ah , until he had cast them out from his presence . Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah reb@@ elled against the king of Babylon .
it happened in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon came , he and all his army , against Jerusalem , and enc@@ amped against it ; and they built for@@ ts against it around it .
they t@@ resp@@ assed against the God of their fathers , and played the pro@@ stitute after the gods of the peoples of the land , whom God destroyed before them .
they minist@@ ered with song before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the T@@ ent of Meeting , until Solomon had built the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in Jerusalem : and they waited on their office according to their order .
so all Israel were reck@@ oned by gene@@ alo@@ gies ; and behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel : and Jud@@ ah was carried away captive to Babylon for their disobedience .
now the first inhabitants who lived in their possessions in their cities were Israel , the priests , the Lev@@ ites , and the Ne@@ thin@@ im .
and their brothers , heads of their fathers ' houses , one thousand seven hundred sixty ; very able men for the work of the service of God 's house .
their brothers , in their villages , were to come in every seven days from time to time to be with them :
these are the singers , heads of fathers ' households of the Lev@@ ites , who lived in the rooms and were free from other service ; for they were employed in their work day and night .
when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , they for@@ s@@ ook their cities , and fled ; and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came and lived in them .
Ab@@ is@@ hai , the brother of Jo@@ ab , he was chief of the three ; for he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
and let us bring again the ark of our God to us . for we did@@ n '@@ t seek it in the days of Saul . "
when they came to the thresh@@ ing floor of Chi@@ don , Uz@@ za put forth his hand to hold the ark ; for the ox@@ en stum@@ bled .
the anger of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was kind@@ led against Uz@@ za , and he struck him , because he put forth his hand to the ark ; and there he died before God .
so they came up to Ba@@ al Per@@ az@@ im , and David struck them there ; and David said , God has broken my enemies by my hand , like the breach of waters . therefore they called the name of that place Ba@@ al Per@@ az@@ im .
they left their gods there ; and David gave commandment , and they were burned with fire .
it happened , as the ark of the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came to the city of David , that Mic@@ h@@ al the daughter of Saul looked out at the window , and saw king David dancing and playing ; and she desp@@ ised him in her heart .
" Don '@@ t touch my ano@@ inted ones ! do my prophets no harm ! "
it shall happen , when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers , that I will set up your seed after you , who shall be of your sons ; and I will establish his kingdom .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . I will not take my loving kindness away from him , as I took it from him that was before you ;
this was a small thing in your eyes , God ; but you have spoken of your servant 's house for a great while to come , and have respected me according to the estate of a man of high degree , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h God .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , for your servant 's sake , and according to your own heart , you have worked all this greatness , to make known all these great things .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , there is none like you , neither is there any God besides you , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
David struck Had@@ ad@@ ez@@ er king of Z@@ ob@@ ah to Ham@@ ath , as he went to establish his dom@@ inion by the river E@@ uph@@ rates .
so they hired for themselves thirty @@@ -@@ @ two thousand ch@@ ari@@ ots , and the king of Ma@@ ac@@ ah and his people , who came and enc@@ amped before Me@@ deb@@ a . the children of Am@@ mon gathered themselves together from their cities , and came to battle .
so G@@ ad came to David , and said to him , " Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' Take your choice :
David lifted up his eyes , and saw the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h standing between earth and the sky , having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem . then David and the elders , clo@@ thed in s@@ ack@@ cloth , fell on their faces .
Ele@@ az@@ ar died , and had no sons , but daughters only : and their brothers the sons of K@@ ish took them as wives .
of all my sons ( for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has given me many sons ) , he has chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's kingdom over Israel .
yours , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , is the greatness , the power , the glory , the victory , and the maj@@ esty ! for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours . yours is the kingdom , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and you are exalted as head above all .
but who am I , and what is my people , that we should be able to offer so willingly as this ? for all things come from you , and of your own have we given you .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God , all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your hand , and is all your own .
and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep your commandments , your testim@@ onies , and your statutes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for which I have made provision . "
David said to all the assembly , " Now bless Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God ! " all the assembly blessed Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fathers , and bowed down their heads and pro@@ str@@ ated themselves before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h and the king .
wisdom and knowledge is granted to you . I will give you riches , wealth , and honor , such as none of the kings have had who have been before you ; neither shall there any after you have the like . "
then Hur@@ am the king of Ty@@ re answered in writing , which he sent to Solomon , " Because Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h loves his people , he has made you king over them . "
Hur@@ am continued , " Bless@@ ed be Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , that made heaven and earth , who has given to David the king a wise son , endowed with discretion and understanding , that should build a house for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and a house for his kingdom .
" now therefore the wheat and the barley , the oil and the wine , which my lord has spoken of , let him send to his servants :
the wings of these cher@@ ub@@ im spread themselves forth twenty cub@@ its : and they stood on their feet , and their faces were toward the house .
the king turned his face , and blessed all the assembly of Israel : and all the assembly of Israel stood .
but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to David my father , ' W@@ here@@ as it was in your heart to build a house for my name , you did well that it was in your heart :
( for Solomon had made a bronze sc@@ aff@@ old , five cub@@ its long , and five cub@@ its broad , and three cub@@ its high , and had set it in the midst of the court ; and on it he stood , and kne@@ eled down on his knees before all the assembly of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heaven ; )
and he said , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , there is no God like you , in heaven , or on earth ; you who keep covenant and loving kindness with your servants , who walk before you with all their heart ;
" when the sky is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sin@@ ned against you ; if they pray toward this place , and confess your name , and turn from their sin , when you aff@@ l@@ ict them :
" moreover concerning the foreigner , who is not of your people Israel , when he shall come from a far country for your great name 's sake , and your mighty hand , and your out@@ stretched arm ; when they shall come and pray toward this house :
" if your people go out to battle against their enemies , by whatever way you shall send them , and they pray to you toward this city which you have chosen , and the house which I have built for your name ;
then hear from heaven , even from your dwelling place , their prayer and their peti@@ tions , and maintain their cause , and forgive your people who have sin@@ ned against you .
" as for you , if you will walk before me as David your father walked , and do according to all that I have commanded you , and will keep my statutes and my ordin@@ ances ;
then I will pl@@ uck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have made holy for my name , I will cast out of my sight , and I will make it a prover@@ b and a by@@ word among all peoples .
she said to the king , " It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts , and of your wisdom .
happy are your men , and happy are these your servants , who stand continually before you , and hear your wisdom .
King Solomon gave to the queen of She@@ ba all her desire , whatever she asked , besides that which she had brought to the king . so she turned , and went to her own land , she and her servants .
they brought every man his tribute , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and clothing , armor , and spices , horses , and mul@@ es , a rate year by year .
'@@ Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " You shall not go up , nor fight against your brothers ! return every man to his house ; for this thing is of me . " ' " so they listened to the words of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and returned from going against J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am .
for the Lev@@ ites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem : for J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am and his sons cast them off , that they should not execute the priest 's office to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ;
Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am loved Ma@@ ac@@ ah the daughter of Ab@@ sal@@ om above all his wives and his conc@@ ub@@ ines : ( for he took eighteen wives , and sixty conc@@ ub@@ ines , and became the father of twenty @@@ -@@ @ eight sons and sixty daughters . )
he did that which was evil , because he did@@ n '@@ t set his heart to seek Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time , and the children of Jud@@ ah prevailed , because they relied on Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fathers .
and commanded Jud@@ ah to seek Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fathers , and to do the law and the commandment .
but when in their distress they turned to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , and sought him , he was found by them .
they entered into the covenant to seek Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fathers , with all their heart and with all their soul ;
it happened , when Ba@@ asha heard of it , that he left off building Ram@@ ah , and let his work cease .
wer@@ en '@@ t the Ethiop@@ ians and the Lub@@ im a huge army , with ch@@ ari@@ ots and hor@@ sem@@ en exceeding many ? yet , because you relied on Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , he delivered them into your hand .
but sought to the God of his father , and walked in his commandments , and not after the do@@ ings of Israel .
they taught in Jud@@ ah , having the book of the law of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h with them ; and they went about throughout all the cities of Jud@@ ah , and taught among the people .
he said , " I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains , as sheep that have no shepherd . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , ' These have no master . let them return every man to his house in peace . ' "
" now therefore , behold , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken evil concerning you . "
the king of Israel said to Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , " I will disguise myself , and go into the battle ; but you put on your robes . " so the king of Israel disguised himself ; and they went into the battle .
Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Jud@@ ah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem .
nevertheless there are good things found in you , in that you have put away the Ash@@ ero@@ th out of the land , and have set your heart to seek God . "
however the high places were not taken away ; neither as yet had the people set their hearts to the God of their fathers .
Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David : and Je@@ hor@@ am his son re@@ igned in his place .
so E@@ dom revol@@ ted from under the hand of Jud@@ ah to this day : then Lib@@ n@@ ah revol@@ ted at the same time from under his hand , because he had for@@ s@@ aken Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of his fathers .
behold , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will strike with a great plague your people , and your children , and your wives , and all your substance ;
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada made a covenant between himself , and all the people , and the king , that they should be Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's people .
they for@@ s@@ ook the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fathers , and served the Ash@@ eri@@ m and the idols : and wrath came on Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem for this their guil@@ t@@ iness .
now it happened , when the kingdom was established to him , that he killed his servants who had killed the king his father .
therefore the anger of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was kind@@ led against Ama@@ zi@@ ah , and he sent to him a prophet , who said to him , " Why have you sought after the gods of the people , which have not delivered their own people out of your hand ? "
but when he was strong , his heart was lifted up , so that he did corrup@@ tly , and he t@@ resp@@ assed against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God ; for he went into Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's temple to burn inc@@ ense on the altar of inc@@ ense .
moreover he burnt inc@@ ense in the valley of the son of H@@ inno@@ m , and burnt his children in the fire , according to the ab@@ om@@ inations of the nations whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h cast out before the children of Israel .
for Pe@@ k@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah killed in Jud@@ ah one hundred twenty thousand in one day , all of them val@@ i@@ ant men ; because they had for@@ s@@ aken Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fathers .
the children of Israel carried away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand , women , sons , and daughters , and took also away much spoil from them , and brought the spoil to Sam@@ aria .
now you purpose to keep under the children of Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem for bond@@ servants and bond@@ m@@ aids for yourselves . are@@ n '@@ t there even with you t@@ resp@@ asses of your own against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God ?
in the time of his distress , he t@@ resp@@ assed yet more against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , this same king A@@ haz .
in every city of Jud@@ ah he made high places to burn inc@@ ense to other gods , and provoked to anger Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of his fathers .
they stood in their place after their order , according to the law of Moses the man of God : the priests sprink@@ led the blood which they received of the hand of the Lev@@ ites .
in every work that he began in the service of God 's house , and in the law , and in the commandments , to seek his God , he did it with all his heart , and prosper@@ ed .
after these things , and this faith@@ fulness , Sen@@ n@@ ach@@ eri@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ria came , and entered into Jud@@ ah , and enc@@ amped against the fortified cities , and thought to win them for himself .
he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the springs which were outside of the city ; and they helped him .
he set cap@@ tains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city , and spoke comfortably to them , saying ,
Don '@@ t you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands ? were the gods of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand ?
who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of my hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand ?
notwithstanding He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah hum@@ bled himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h did@@ n '@@ t come on them in the days of He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah .
He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah had exceeding much riches and honor : and he provided him treas@@ uries for silver , and for gold , and for precious stones , and for spices , and for shi@@ elds , and for all kinds of goo@@ dly vessels ;
this same He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gi@@ hon , and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David . He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah prosper@@ ed in all his works .
when he was in distress , he beg@@ ged Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God , and hum@@ bled himself greatly before the God of his fathers .
nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places , but only to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and walked in the ways of David his father , and did@@ n '@@ t turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
for in the eighth year of his reign , while he was yet young , he began to seek after the God of David his father ; and in the twel@@ fth year he began to purge Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem from the high places , and the Ash@@ eri@@ m , and the engra@@ ved images , and the mol@@ ten images .
so the service was prepared , and the priests stood in their place , and the Lev@@ ites by their divisions , according to the king 's commandment .
afterward they prepared for themselves , and for the priests , because the priests the sons of Aaron were busy with offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night : therefore the Lev@@ ites prepared for themselves , and for the priests the sons of Aaron .
Jer@@ emi@@ ah lam@@ ented for Jo@@ si@@ ah : and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Jo@@ si@@ ah in their lam@@ ent@@ ations to this day ; and they made them an ordin@@ ance in Israel : and behold , they are written in the lam@@ ent@@ ations .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned eleven years in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God .
he also reb@@ elled against king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar , who had made him swear by God : but he sti@@ ff@@ ened his neck , and hardened his heart against turning to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred . Sh@@ esh@@ b@@ azz@@ ar brought all these up , when the cap@@ tives were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem .
these were those who went up from Tel Mel@@ ah , Tel Har@@ sha , cher@@ u@@ b , Ad@@ dan , and Im@@ mer ; but they could not show their fathers ' houses , and their seed , whether they were of Israel :
so the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , and some of the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the Ne@@ thin@@ im , lived in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers : so you shall find in the book of the records , and know that this city is a rebelli@@ ous city , and hur@@ tful to kings and provinces , and that they have moved se@@ dition within the same of old time ; for which cause was this city laid waste .
for the priests and the Lev@@ ites had purified themselves together ; all of them were pure : and they killed the Pas@@ sover for all the children of the cap@@ tivity , and for their brothers the priests , and for themselves .
for E@@ z@@ ra had set his heart to seek the law of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and to do it , and to teach in Israel statutes and ordin@@ ances .
whatever shall seem good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , do that after the will of your God .
then I proclaimed a fast there , at the river A@@ ha@@ va , that we might humble ourselves before our God , to seek of him a straight way for us , and for our little ones , and for all our substance .
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons , so that the holy seed have mixed themselves with the peoples of the lands . yes , the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this t@@ resp@@ ass . "
at the evening offering I arose up from my humiliation , even with my garment and my robe torn ; and I fell on my knees , and spread out my hands to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h my God ;
and I said , " My God , I am ashamed and bl@@ ush to lift up my face to you , my God ; for our ini@@ qu@@ ities have increased over our head , and our guil@@ t@@ iness has grown up to the heavens .
shall we again break your commandments , and join in aff@@ inity with the peoples that do these ab@@ om@@ inations ? w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t you be angry with us until you had consumed us , so that there should be no remn@@ ant , nor any to escape ?
they gave their hand that they would put away their wives ; and being guilty , they offered a ram of the flock for their guilt .
all these had taken foreign wives ; and some of them had wives by whom they had children .
that Han@@ ani , one of my brothers , came , he and certain men out of Jud@@ ah ; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped , who were left of the cap@@ tivity , and concerning Jerusalem .
I said to the king , " Let the king live forever ! why shoul@@ d@@ n '@@ t my face be sad , when the city , the place of my fathers ' tom@@ bs , lies waste , and its gates have been consumed with fire ? "
I told them of the hand of my God which was good on me , as also of the king 's words that he had spoken to me . they said , " Let 's rise up and build . " so they strengthened their hands for the good work .
next to them , the Te@@ ko@@ ites made repairs ; but their no@@ bles did@@ n '@@ t put their nec@@ ks to the work of their lord .
and the builders , everyone wore his sword at his side , and so built . he who sounded the trum@@ pet was by me .
likewise at the same time said I to the people , " Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem , that in the night they may be a guard to us , and may labor in the day . "
some also there were that said , " We are mortg@@ aging our fields , and our vineyards , and our houses . let us get grain , because of the famine . "
it happened , when all our enemies heard of it , that all the nations that were about us were afraid , and were much cast down in their own eyes ; for they perceived that this work was worked of our God .
for there were many in Jud@@ ah sworn to him , because he was the son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law of Sh@@ ec@@ ani@@ ah the son of Ara@@ h ; and his son Je@@ ho@@ han@@ an had taken the daughter of M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lam the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah as wife .
and E@@ z@@ ra blessed Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the great God . all the people answered , " A@@ men , A@@ men , " with the lifting up of their hands . they bowed their heads , and worshi@@ ped Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h with their faces to the ground .
so the people went out , and brought them , and made themselves boo@@ ths , everyone on the roof of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of God 's house , and in the broad place of the water gate , and in the broad place of the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
the seed of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners , and stood and confessed their sins , and the ini@@ qu@@ ities of their fathers .
you gave also your good Spirit to instruct them , and did@@ n '@@ t with@@ hold your man@@ na from their mouth , and gave them water for their thirst .
" nevertheless they were dis@@ obedient , and reb@@ elled against you , and cast your law behind their back , and killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you , and they committed awful bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ies .
and that we would not give our daughters to the peoples of the land , nor take their daughters for our sons ;
also we made ordin@@ ances for ourselves , to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a she@@ kel for the service of the house of our God ;
now these are the chiefs of the province who lived in Jerusalem ; but in the cities of Jud@@ ah everyone lived in his possession in their cities : Israel , the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , and the Ne@@ thin@@ im , and the children of Solomon 's servants .
of the Lev@@ ites , certain divisions in Jud@@ ah settled in Benjamin 's territory .
remember me , my God , concerning this , and don '@@ t wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God , and for its observ@@ ances .
one of the sons of Jo@@ i@@ ada , the son of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the high priest , was son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law to San@@ ball@@ at the Hor@@ on@@ ite : therefore I ch@@ ased him from me .
that in those days , when the King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us sat on the throne of his kingdom , which was in Sh@@ ush@@ an the palace ,
in the third year of his reign , he made a feast for all his princes and his servants ; the power of Persia and Media , the no@@ bles and princes of the provinces , being before him .
he displayed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent maj@@ esty many days , even one hundred eighty days .
when these days were fulfilled , the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in Sh@@ ush@@ an the palace , both great and small , in the court of the garden of the king 's palace .
for this deed of the queen will become known to all women , causing them to show contempt for their husbands , when it is reported , ' King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us commanded V@@ ash@@ ti the queen to be brought in before him , but she did@@ n '@@ t come . '
when the king 's decree which he shall make is published throughout all his kingdom ( for it is great ) , all the wives will give their husbands honor , both great and small . "
now when Mor@@ dec@@ ai found out all that was done , Mor@@ dec@@ ai t@@ ore his clothes , and put on s@@ ack@@ cloth with ashes , and went out into the midst of the city , and w@@ ailed loudly and a bit@@ terly .
Es@@ ther 's mai@@ dens and her e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s came and told her this , and the queen was exceedingly griev@@ ed . she sent clothing to Mor@@ dec@@ ai , to replace his s@@ ack@@ cloth ; but he did@@ n '@@ t receive it .
nevertheless Ham@@ an restrained himself , and went home . there , he sent and called for his friends and Zer@@ esh his wife .
Ham@@ an recoun@@ ted to them the glory of his riches , the multitude of his children , all the things in which the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
so Ham@@ an came in . the king said to him , " What shall be done to the man whom the king deli@@ ghts to honor ? " now Ham@@ an said in his heart , " Who would the king delight to honor more than myself ? "
Mor@@ dec@@ ai came back to the king 's gate , but Ham@@ an hur@@ ried to his house , mourning and having his head covered .
then Es@@ ther the queen answered , " If I have found favor in your sight , O king , and if it please the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request .
the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden . Ham@@ an stood up to make request for his life to Es@@ ther the queen ; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king .
the king took off his ring , which he had taken from Ham@@ an , and gave it to Mor@@ dec@@ ai . Es@@ ther set Mor@@ dec@@ ai over the house of Ham@@ an .
for how can I endure to see the evil that would come to my people ? how can I endure to see the destruction of my relatives ? "
then King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us said to Es@@ ther the queen and to Mor@@ dec@@ ai the Jew , " See , I have given Es@@ ther the house of Ham@@ an , and him they have han@@ ged on the g@@ allows , because he laid his hand on the Jews .
a copy of the letter , that the decree should be given out in every province , was published to all the peoples , that the Jews should be ready for that day to av@@ enge themselves on their enemies .
the Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword , and with slaughter and destruction , and did what they wanted to those who hated them .
to enjo@@ in them that they should keep the four@@ teenth and fif@@ teenth days of the month Ad@@ ar yearly ,
to confirm these days of Pur@@ im in their appointed times , as Mor@@ dec@@ ai the Jew and Es@@ ther the queen had decre@@ ed , and as they had imposed upon themselves and their descendants , in the matter of the fast@@ ings and their cry .
while he was still speaking , there came also another , and said , " Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their el@@ dest brother 's house ,
then Job arose , and t@@ ore his robe , and sha@@ ved his head , and fell down on the ground , and worshi@@ ped .
he took for himself a pot@@ sh@@ er@@ d to sc@@ rape himself with , and he sat among the ashes .
when they lifted up their eyes from a distance , and did@@ n '@@ t recognize him , they raised their voices , and we@@ pt ; and they each t@@ ore his robe , and sprink@@ led dust on their heads toward the sky .
because it did@@ n '@@ t shut up the doors of my mother 's womb , nor did it hide trouble from my eyes .
with kings and counsel@@ ors of the earth , who built up waste places for themselves ;
but now it has come to you , and you faint . it touches you , and you are troubled .
is@@ n '@@ t your pi@@ ety your confidence ? is@@ n '@@ t the integrity of your ways your hope ?
behold , he puts no trust in his servants . he charges his angels with error .
so the poor has hope , and injustice shu@@ ts her mouth .
you shall know that your tent is in peace . you shall visit your fold , and shall miss nothing .
look this , we have searched it , so it is . hear it , and know it for your good . "
in the dry season , they v@@ anish . when it is hot , they are consumed out of their place .
as a servant who ear@@ ne@@ stly desires the shadow , as a hi@@ rel@@ ing who looks for his wages ,
so that my soul chooses strang@@ ling , death rather than my bones .
if I have sin@@ ned , what do I do to you , you wat@@ cher of men ? why have you set me as a mark for you , so that I am a burden to myself ?
" how long will you speak these things ? shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind ?
while it is yet in its green@@ ness , not cut down , it with@@ ers before any other re@@ ed .
he will still fill your mouth with laughter , your lips with shouting .
he removes the mountains , and they don '@@ t know it , when he over@@ turns them in his anger .
though I were righteous , yet I w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t answer him . I would make suppl@@ ication to my judge .
though I am righteous , my own mouth shall condemn me . though I am bl@@ am@@ eless , it shall prove me perverse .
I am afraid of all my sor@@ rows , I know that you will not hold me innocent .
there is no ump@@ ire between us , that might lay his hand on us both .
then I would speak , and not fear him , for I am not so in myself .
is it good to you that you should op@@ press , that you should desp@@ ise the work of your hands , and smile on the counsel of the wicked ?
yet you hid these things in your heart . I know that this is with you :
if I am wicked , w@@ oe to me . if I am righteous , I still shall not lift up my head , being filled with dis@@ grace , and conscious of my afflic@@ tion .
if ini@@ qu@@ ity is in your hand , put it far away . Don '@@ t let un@@ righteousness dwell in your tents .
I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor , I , who called on God , and he answered . the just , the bl@@ am@@ eless man is a joke .
the tents of rob@@ bers prosper . those who provoke God are secure , who carry their God in their hands .
" only don '@@ t do two things to me ; then I will not hide myself from your face :
for you write bitter things against me , and make me inherit the ini@@ qu@@ ities of my youth :
seeing his days are determined , the number of his months is with you , and you have appointed his bounds that he can '@@ t pass ;
you would call , and I would answer you . you would have a desire to the work of your hands .
but now you number my steps . Don '@@ t you watch over my sin ?
your own mouth condem@@ ns you , and not I. Yes , your own lips testify against you .
have you heard the secret counsel of God ? do you limit wisdom to yourself ?
that you turn your spirit against God , and let such words go out of your mouth ?
behold , he puts no trust in his holy ones . yes , the heavens are not clean in his sight ;
( which wise men have told by their fathers , and have not hidden it ;
because he has stretched out his hand against God , and behaves himself proudly against the Almighty ;
he runs at him with a stiff neck , with the thick shi@@ elds of his buck@@ lers ;
because he has covered his face with his fat@@ ness , and gathered fat on his thi@@ gh@@ s .
he shall shake off his un@@ ripe grap@@ e as the vine , and shall cast off his flower as the olive tree .
I also could speak as you do . if your soul were in my soul 's place , I could join words together against you , and shake my head at you ,
they have g@@ aped on me with their mouth . they have struck me on the cheek repro@@ ach@@ fully . they gather themselves together against me .
that he would maintain the right of a man with God , of a son of man with his neighbor !
he who den@@ ounces his friends for a prey , Even the eyes of his children shall fail .
you who tear yourself in your anger , shall the earth be for@@ s@@ aken for you ? or shall the rock be removed out of its place ?
my bones stick to my skin and to my flesh . I have escaped by the skin of my teeth .
yet his food in his bow@@ els is turned . it is co@@ bra ven@@ om within him .
" because he knew no qui@@ et@@ ness within him , he shall not save anything of that in which he deli@@ ghts .
they spend their days in prosperity . in an instant they go down to She@@ ol .
for what does he care for his house after him , when the number of his months is cut off ?
therefore sn@@ ares are around you . sudden fear troubles you ,
the Almighty will be your treasure , and precious silver to you .
you shall make your prayer to him , and he will hear you . you shall pay your v@@ ows .
you shall also decree a thing , and it shall be established to you . light shall shine on your ways .
" even today my complaint is rebelli@@ ous . his hand is heavy in spite of my gro@@ aning .
in the dark they dig through houses . they shut themselves up in the daytime . they don '@@ t know the light .
" dom@@ inion and fear are with him . he makes peace in his high places .
job again took up his parable , and said ,
he builds his house as the moth , as a booth which the watch@@ man makes .
job again took up his parable , and said ,
the princes ref@@ rained from talking , and laid their hand on their mouth .
then I said , ' I shall die in my own house , I shall number my days as the sand .
my root is spread out to the waters . the de@@ w lies all night on my branch .
after my words they did@@ n '@@ t speak again . my speech fell on them .
they abh@@ or me , they stand alo@@ of from me , and don '@@ t hesitate to sp@@ it in my face .
for he has unti@@ ed his cord , and afflicted me ; and they have thrown off restraint before me .
" however do@@ es@@ n '@@ t one stretch out a hand in his fall ? or in his calamity therefore cry for help ?
if his heart h@@ as@@ n '@@ t blessed me , if he h@@ as@@ n '@@ t been war@@ med with my sheep 's fle@@ ece ;
I said , ' Days should speak , and multitude of years should teach wisdom . '
behold , my terror shall not make you afraid , neither shall my pressure be heavy on you .
he is cha@@ st@@ ened also with pain on his bed , with continual strife in his bones ;
his flesh shall be fresh@@ er than a child 's . he returns to the days of his youth .
" if now you have understanding , hear this . listen to the voice of my words .
shall his re@@ comp@@ ense be as you desire , that you refuse it ? for you must choose , and not I. T@@ herefore speak what you know .
if they listen and serve him , they shall spend their days in prosperity , and their years in pleasures .
and said , ' Here you may come , but no further . here your proud waves shall be stayed ? '
she deals harsh@@ ly with her young ones , as if they were not hers . though her labor is in vain , she is without fear ,
is it at your command that the eagle moun@@ ts up , and makes his nest on high ?
will you even ann@@ ul my judgment ? will you condemn me , that you may be justified ?
" now deck yourself with excell@@ ency and dignity . array yourself with honor and maj@@ esty .
" can you draw out L@@ evi@@ athan with a f@@ ish@@ hook , or press down his tongue with a cord ?
will he make a covenant with you , that you should take him for a servant forever ?
lay your hand on him . remember the battle , and do so no more .
the fl@@ akes of his flesh are joined together . they are firm on him . they can '@@ t be moved .
he makes a path shine after him . one would think the deep had white hair .
you said , ' List@@ en , now , and I will speak ; I will question you , and you will answer me . '
after this Job lived one hundred forty years , and saw his sons , and his sons ' sons , to four generations .
he will be like a tree planted by the streams of water , that brings forth its fruit in its season , whose leaf also does not wi@@ ther . whatever he does shall prosper .
" let 's break their bonds apart , and cast their cor@@ ds from us . "
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; A Psal@@ m by David , when he fled from Ab@@ sal@@ om his son . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , how my adversaries have increased ! many are those who rise up against me .
arise , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ! save me , my God ! for you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone . you have broken the teeth of the wicked .
but know that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has set apart for himself him who is go@@ dly : Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will hear when I call to him .
for you are not a God who has pleasure in w@@ ick@@ edness . evil can '@@ t live with you .
the arrogant shall not stand in your sight . you hate all workers of ini@@ qu@@ ity .
lead me , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , in your righteousness because of my enemies . make your way straight before my face .
hold them guilty , God . let them fall by their own coun@@ sels ; Thr@@ ust them out in the multitude of their trans@@ gres@@ sions , for they have reb@@ elled against you .
but let all those who take refuge in you rejoice , Let them always shout for joy , because you defend them . let them also who love your name be joyful in you .
for in death there is no memory of you . in She@@ ol , who shall give you thanks ?
my eye wastes away because of grief . it grows old because of all my adversaries .
arise , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , in your anger . lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries . awake for me . you have commanded judgment .
let the congregation of the peoples surround you . rule over them on high .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ad@@ ministers judgment to the peoples . judge me , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , according to my righteousness , and to my integrity that is in me .
I will be glad and rejoice in you . I will sing praise to your name , O Most High .
when my enemies turn back , they stum@@ ble and perish in your presence .
those who know your name will put their trust in you , for you , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have not for@@ s@@ aken those who seek you .
for the wicked boasts of his heart 's cra@@ vings . he bl@@ esses the greedy , and condem@@ ns Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
he lur@@ ks in secret as a lion in his amb@@ ush . he lies in wait to catch the helpless . he catches the helpless , when he draws him in his net .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; For the Chief Mus@@ ician . by David . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; In Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , I take refuge . how can you say to my soul , " Fle@@ e as a bird to your mountain ! "
but I trust in your loving kindness . my heart rejo@@ ices in your salvation .
I will sing to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , because he has been good to me .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; A Psal@@ m by David . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , who shall dwell in your sanctuary ? who shall live on your holy hill ?
he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t slan@@ der with his tongue , nor does evil to his friend , nor casts sl@@ urs against his fellow man ;
he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t lend out his money for us@@ ury , nor take a bribe against the innocent . he who does these things shall never be shaken .
my soul , you have said to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " You are my Lord . apart from you I have no good thing . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h assigned my portion and my cup . you made my lot secure .
for you will not leave my soul in She@@ ol , neither will you allow your holy one to see corruption .
you have proved my heart . you have visited me in the night . you have tried me , and found nothing . I have resolved that my mouth shall not dis@@ obey .
show your marvelous loving kindness , you who save those who take refuge by your right hand from their enemies .
from the wicked who op@@ press me , my deadly enemies , who surround me .
they close up their call@@ ous hearts . with their mouth they speak proudly .
arise , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , confront him . cast him down . deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword ;
as for me , I shall see your face in righteousness . I shall be satisfied , when I awake , with seeing your form .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is my rock , my fortress , and my deliver@@ er ; my God , my rock , in whom I take refuge ; my shield , and the horn of my salvation , my high tower .
he made darkness his hiding place , his pavilion around him , darkness of waters , thick clouds of the skies .
then the channels of waters appeared . the foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebu@@ ke , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , at the blast of the breath of your no@@ str@@ ils .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has rewarded me according to my righteousness . according to the clean@@ ness of my hands has he re@@ comp@@ en@@ sed me .
for I have kept the ways of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and have not w@@ ick@@ edly departed from my God .
therefore Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has rewarded me according to my righteousness , according to the clean@@ ness of my hands in his eye@@ sight .
the foreigners shall fade away , and shall come trembling out of their close places .
he rescu@@ es me from my enemies . yes , you lift me up above those who rise up against me . you deliver me from the violent man .
which is as a bri@@ deg@@ room coming out of his room , like a strong man rejo@@ icing to run his course .
who can discern his errors ? forgive me from hidden errors .
remember all your offerings , and accept your burnt sacrifice . Sel@@ ah .
now I know that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h saves his ano@@ inted . he will answer him from his holy heaven , with the saving strength of his right hand .
they are bowed down and fallen , but we rise up , and stand upright .
he asked life of you , you gave it to him , even length of days forever and ever .
your hand will find out all of your enemies . your right hand will find out those who hate you .
you will make them as a fiery furnace in the time of your anger . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will swallow them up in his wrath . the fire shall dev@@ our them .
for they intended evil against you . they plo@@ tted evil against you which C@@ AN@@ NOT succeed .
for you will make them turn their back , when you aim drawn b@@ ows at their face .
they open their mouths wide against me , lions tearing prey and ro@@ aring .
they divide my garments among them . they cast lots for my clothing .
I will declare your name to my brothers . in the midst of the assembly , I will praise you .
all the rich ones of the earth shall eat and worship . all those who go down to the dust shall bow before him , even he who can '@@ t keep his soul alive .
this is the generation of those who seek Him , who seek your fac@@ e@@ -@@ -@@ even Jacob . Sel@@ ah .
yes , no one who waits for you shall be sh@@ amed . they shall be sh@@ amed who deal treach@@ er@@ ously without cause .
Don '@@ t remember the sins of my youth , nor my trans@@ gres@@ sions . remember me according to your loving kindness , for your goodness ' sake , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
consider my enemies , for they are many . they hate me with cruel hatred .
for your loving kindness is before my eyes . I have walked in your truth .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , I love the hab@@ itation of your house , the place where your glory d@@ wells .
Don '@@ t gather my soul with sinners , nor my life with blood@@ thir@@ sty men ;
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; By David . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is my light and my salvation . whom shall I fear ? Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is the strength of my life . of whom shall I be afraid ?
one thing I have asked of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that I will seek after , that I may dwell in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h all the days of my life , to see Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's beauty , and to inqu@@ ire in his temple .
for in the day of trouble he will keep me secretly in his pavilion . in the covert of his tab@@ ern@@ acle he will hide me . he will lift me up on a rock .
when you said , " Se@@ ek my face , " my heart said to you , " I will seek your face , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
Don '@@ t hide your face from me . Don '@@ t put your servant away in anger . you have been my help . Don '@@ t abandon me , neither for@@ sake me , God of my salvation .
teach me your way , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . lead me in a straight path , because of my enemies .
hear the voice of my peti@@ tions , when I cry to you , when I lift up my hands toward your Most Holy Place .
I cried to you , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h I made suppl@@ ication :
" what profit is there in my destruction , if I go down to the pit ? shall the dust praise you ? shall it declare your truth ?
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; For the Chief Mus@@ ician . a Psal@@ m by David . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; In you , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , I take refuge . let me never be disappointed . deliver me in your righteousness .
I will be glad and rejoice in your loving kindness , for you have seen my afflic@@ tion . you have known my soul in ad@@ versities .
because of all my adversaries I have become utterly cont@@ emp@@ tible to my neighbors , A fear to my acquaintances . those who saw me on the street fled from me .
my times are in your hand . deliver me from the hand of my enemies , and from those who persec@@ ute me .
make your face to shine on your servant . save me in your loving kindness .
Oh how great is your goodness , which you have laid up for those who fear you , which you have worked for those who take refuge in you , before the sons of men !
in the shelter of your presence you will hide them from the plo@@ tting of man . you will keep them secretly in a dwelling away from the strife of tongues .
when I kept silence , my bones wasted away through my gro@@ aning all day long .
let your loving kindness be on us , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , since we have hoped in you .
keep your tongue from evil , and your lips from speaking lies .
for without cause they have hidden their net in a pit for me . without cause they have dug a pit for my soul .
wake up ! rise up to defend me , my God ! my Lord , contend for me !
let them shout for joy and be glad , who favor my righteous cause . yes , let them say continually , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h be magni@@ fied , who has pleasure in the prosperity of his servant ! "
my tongue shall talk about your righteousness and about your praise all day long .
for with you is the spring of life . in your light shall we see light .
Oh continue your loving kindness to those who know you , your righteousness to the upright in heart .
rest in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and wait patiently for him . Don '@@ t fre@@ t because of him who prosp@@ ers in his way , because of the man who makes wicked plots happen .
the wicked have drawn out the sword , and have bent their bow , to cast down the poor and ne@@ edy , to kill those who are upright in the way .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; A Psal@@ m by David , for a memorial . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , don '@@ t rebu@@ ke me in your wrath , neither cha@@ sten me in your hot dis@@ pleasure .
there is no sound@@ ness in my flesh because of your indignation , neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin .
for my waist is filled with burning . there is no sound@@ ness in my flesh .
Lord , all my desire is before you . my gro@@ aning is not hidden from you .
my lovers and my friends stand alo@@ of from my plague . my kin@@ smen stand far away .
my heart was hot within me . while I med@@ itated , the fire burned : I spoke with my tongue :
now , Lord , what do I wait for ? my hope is in you .
remove your scourge away from me . I am overcome by the blow of your hand .
" hear my prayer , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and give ear to my cry . Don '@@ t be silent at my tears . for I am a stranger with you , a foreigner , as all my fathers were .
he has put a new song in my mouth , even praise to our God . many shall see it , and fear , and shall trust in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
blessed is the man who makes Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his trust , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t respect the proud , nor such as turn aside to lies .
I delight to do your will , my God . yes , your law is within my heart . "
I have proclaimed glad news of righteousness in the great assembly . behold , I will not seal my lips , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , you know .
I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart . I have declared your faith@@ fulness and your salvation . I have not concealed your loving kindness and your truth from the great assembly .
for innumerable evils have surrounded me . my ini@@ qu@@ ities have over@@ taken me , so that I am not able to look up . they are more than the ha@@ irs of my head . my heart has failed me .
let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you . let such as love your salvation say continually , " Let Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h be exalted ! "
if he comes to see me , he speaks false@@ hood . his heart g@@ athers ini@@ qu@@ ity to itself . when he goes abroad , he tells it .
all who hate me whis@@ per together against me . they imagine the worst for me .
all this has come on us , yet have we not forgotten you , N@@ either have we been false to your covenant .
you have loved righteousness , and hated w@@ ick@@ edness . therefore God , your God , has ano@@ inted you with the oil of gl@@ ad@@ ness above your fellows .
kings ' daughters are among your honorable women . at your right hand the queen stands in gold of O@@ ph@@ ir .
so the king will desire your beauty , honor him , for he is your lord .
I will make your name to be remembered in all generations . therefore the peoples shall give you thanks forever and ever .
God re@@ igns over the nations . God sits on his holy throne .
my mouth will speak words of wisdom . my heart shall utter understanding .
those who trust in their wealth , and boast in the multitude of their rich@@ es@@ --
though while he lived he blessed his sou@@ l@@ -- and men praise you when you do well for your@@ self@@ --
I have no need for a bull from your stall , nor male goats from your pens .
but to the wicked God says , " What right do you have to declare my statutes , that you have taken my covenant on your lips ,
since you hate instruction , and throw my words behind you ?
" you give your mouth to evil . your tongue frames dece@@ it .
you have done these things , and I kept silent . you thought that I was just like you . I will rebu@@ ke you , and accuse you in front of your eyes .
whoever offers the sacrifice of thank@@ s@@ giving glori@@ fies me , and prepares his way so that I will show God 's salvation to him . "
hide your face from my sins , and b@@ lot out all of my ini@@ qu@@ ities .
restore to me the joy of your salvation . uphold me with a willing spirit .
Lord , open my lips . my mouth shall declare your praise .
" behold , this is the man who did@@ n '@@ t make God his strength , but trusted in the abundance of his riches , and strengthened himself in his w@@ ick@@ edness . "
for strangers have risen up against me . violent men have sought after my soul . they haven '@@ t set God before them . Sel@@ ah .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; For the Chief Mus@@ ician . on str@@ ing@@ ed instruments . a contempl@@ ation by David . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; List@@ en to my prayer , God . Don '@@ t hide yourself from my suppl@@ ication .
he raises his hands against his friends . he has violated his covenant .
but you , God , will bring them down into the pit of destruction . blood@@ thir@@ sty and dece@@ it@@ ful men shall not live out half their days , but I will trust in you .
when I am afraid , I will put my trust in you .
shall they escape by ini@@ qu@@ ity ? in anger cast down the peoples , God .
you number my wan@@ der@@ ings . you put my tears into your bottle . are@@ n '@@ t they in your book ?
their poison is like the poison of a snake ; like a deaf co@@ bra that stops its ear ,
the righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance . he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked ;
my God will go before me with his loving kindness . God will let me look at my enemies in triumph .
for the sin of their mouth , and the words of their lips , let them be caught in their pride , for the cur@@ ses and lies which they utter .
to you , my strength , I will sing pra@@ ises . for God is my high tower , the God of my mercy .
Gil@@ e@@ ad is mine , and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h is mine . E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im also is the defense of my head . Jud@@ ah is my scep@@ ter .
so I will sing praise to your name forever , that I may fulfill my v@@ ows daily .
with God is my salvation and my honor . the rock of my strength , and my refuge , is in God .
so I will bless you while I live . I will lift up my hands in your name .
who shar@@ pen their tongue like a sword , and aim their arrows , deadly words ,
to shoot innocent men from amb@@ ushes . they shoot at him suddenly and fear@@ lessly .
their own tongues shall ruin them . all who see them will shake their heads .
blessed is one whom you choose , and cause to come near , that he may live in your courts . we will be filled with the goodness of your house , your holy temple .
which my lips promised , and my mouth spoke , when I was in distress .
the earth has yielded its increase . God , even our own God , will bless us .
but God will strike through the head of his enemies , the hair@@ y scal@@ p of such a one as still continues in his guil@@ t@@ iness .
that you may crush them , di@@ pping your foot in blood , that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion from your enemies . "
because of your temple at Jerusalem , kings shall bring presents to you .
princes shall come out of Egypt . Ethiopia shall hurry to stretch out her hands to God .
God , you know my fool@@ is@@ hness . my sins are@@ n '@@ t hidden from you .
Don '@@ t let those who wait for you be sh@@ amed through me , Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies . Don '@@ t let those who seek you be brought to dis@@ honor through me , God of Israel .
because for your sake , I have borne repro@@ ach . shame has covered my face .
for the zeal of your house consumes me . the repro@@ aches of those who repro@@ ach you have fallen on me .
when I made s@@ ack@@ cloth my clothing , I became a by@@ word to them .
but as for me , my prayer is to you , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , in an acceptable time . God , in the abundance of your loving kindness , answer me in the truth of your salvation .
Don '@@ t hide your face from your servant , for I am in distress . answer me spe@@ ed@@ ily !
draw near to my soul , and re@@ deem it . ran@@ som me because of my enemies .
charge them with crime upon crime . Don '@@ t let them come into your righteousness .
let them be disappointed and conf@@ ounded who seek my soul . let those who desire my ruin be turned back in dis@@ grace .
let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you . let those who love your salvation continually say , " Let God be exalted ! "
for my enemies talk about me . those who watch for my soul consp@@ ire together ,
let my acc@@ users be disappointed and consumed . let them be covered with dis@@ grace and scor@@ n who want to harm me .
God , you have taught me from my youth . until now , I have declared your won@@ dr@@ ous works .
but as for me , my feet were almost gone . my steps had nearly slipped .
they have set their mouth in the heavens . their tongue walks through the earth .
if I had said , " I will speak thus " ; behold , I would have betrayed the generation of your children .
for , behold , those who are far from you shall perish . you have destroyed all those who are un@@ faithful to you .
but it is good for me to come close to God . I have made the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h my refuge , that I may tell of all your works .
remember your congregation , which you purchased of old , which you have re@@ deemed to be the tribe of your inheritance ; Mount Z@@ ion , in which you have lived .
your adversaries have ro@@ ared in the midst of your assembly . they have set up their standards as signs .
they said in their heart , " We will crush them completely . " they have burned up all the places in the land where God was worshi@@ ped .
Don '@@ t forget the voice of your adversaries . the tum@@ ult of those who rise up against you asc@@ ends continually .
val@@ i@@ ant men lie pl@@ under@@ ed , they have slept their last sleep . none of the men of war can lift their hands .
you , even you , are to be feared . who can stand in your sight when you are angry ?
you hold my ey@@ eli@@ ds open . I am so troubled that I can '@@ t speak .
I will also meditate on all your work , and consider your do@@ ings .
the voice of your thunder was in the whir@@ l@@ wind . the light@@ nings lit up the world . the earth trem@@ bled and shook .
that they might set their hope in God , and not forget the works of God , but keep his commandments ,
and might not be as their fathers , a stubborn and rebelli@@ ous generation , a generation that did@@ n '@@ t make their hearts loyal , whose spirit was not stead@@ fast with God .
they tempted God in their heart by asking food according to their desire .
he caused the east wind to blow in the sky . by his power he guided the south wind .
but they fl@@ attered him with their mouth , and lied to him with their tongue .
but he , being mer@@ ciful , for@@ gave ini@@ qu@@ ity , and did@@ n '@@ t destroy them . yes , many times he turned his anger away , and did@@ n '@@ t stir up all his wrath .
for they provoked him to anger with their high places , and moved him to jealousy with their engra@@ ved images .
so he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart , and guided them by the skill@@ fulness of his hands .
pour out your wrath on the nations that don '@@ t know you ; on the king@@ doms that don '@@ t call on your name ;
so we , your people and sheep of your past@@ ure , will give you thanks forever . we will praise you forever , to all generations .
so we will not turn away from you . revive us , and we will call on your name .
for they have con@@ spi@@ red together with one mind . they form an alliance against you .
yes , the spar@@ row has found a home , and the swallow a nest for herself , where she may have her young , near your al@@ t@@ ars , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , my King , and my God .
for a day in your courts is better than a thousand . I would rather be a door@@ keeper in the house of my God , than to dwell in the tents of w@@ ick@@ edness .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , blessed is the man who trusts in you .
righteousness goes before him , And prepares the way for his steps .
preserve my soul , for I am go@@ dly . you , my God , save your servant who trusts in you .
in the day of my trouble I will call on you , for you will answer me .
God , the proud have risen up against me . a company of violent men have sought after my soul , and they don '@@ t hold regard for you before them .
set apart among the dead , like the sl@@ ain who lie in the grave , whom you remember no more . they are cut off from your hand .
you have taken my friends from me . you have made me an ab@@ om@@ ination to them . I am confined , and I can '@@ t escape .
is your loving kindness declared in the grave ? or your faith@@ fulness in De@@ struction ?
but to you , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , I have cried . in the morning , my prayer comes before you .
you have put lover and friend far from me , and my friends into darkness .
the heavens will praise your wonders , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; your faith@@ fulness also in the assembly of the holy ones .
you have broken Ra@@ hab in pieces , like one of the sl@@ ain . you have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm .
righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne . loving kindness and truth go before your face .
blessed are the people who learn to ac@@ claim you . they walk in the light of your presence , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
if his children for@@ sake my law , and don '@@ t walk in my ordin@@ ances ;
if they break my statutes , and don '@@ t keep my commandments ;
but I will not completely take my loving kindness from him , nor allow my faith@@ fulness to fail .
but you have rejected and spur@@ ned . you have been angry with your ano@@ inted .
all who pass by the way rob him . he has become a repro@@ ach to his neighbors .
what man is he who shall live and not see death , who shall deliver his soul from the power of She@@ ol ? Sel@@ ah .
because you have made Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your refuge , and the Most High your dwelling place ,
for he will put his angels in charge of you , to guard you in all your ways .
you who love Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , hate evil . he preserves the souls of his saints . he delivers them out of the hand of the wicked .
he who practices dece@@ it won '@@ t dwell within my house . he who speaks false@@ hood won '@@ t be established before my eyes .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; A Pra@@ yer of the afflicted , when he is overwhelmed and p@@ ours out his complaint before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; He@@ ar my prayer , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ! let my cry come to you .
Don '@@ t hide your face from me in the day of my distress . turn your ear to me . answer me quickly in the day when I call .
because of your indignation and your wrath , for you have taken me up , and thrown me away .
so the nations will fear the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; all the kings of the earth your glory .
for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has built up Z@@ ion . he has appeared in his glory .
the children of your servants will continue . their seed will be established before you . "
he made known his ways to Moses , his deeds to the children of Israel .
man goes forth to his work , to his labor until the evening .
you give to them ; they gather . you open your hand ; they are satisfied with good .
" Don '@@ t touch my ano@@ inted ones ! do my prophets no harm ! "
he brought forth his people with joy , his chosen with singing .
thus they exchanged their glory for an image of a bull that eats grass .
but mur@@ mu@@ red in their tents , and did@@ n '@@ t listen to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's voice .
thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds . the plague broke in on them .
yes , they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons .
they shed innocent blood , even the blood of their sons and of their daughters , whom they sacrificed to the idols of Can@@ a@@ an . the land was polluted with blood .
many times he delivered them , but they were rebelli@@ ous in their counsel , and were brought low in their ini@@ qu@@ ity .
he remembered for them his covenant , and rep@@ ented according to the multitude of his loving kind@@ nesses .
fo@@ ols are afflicted because of their disobedience , and because of their ini@@ qu@@ ities .
let his children be wandering beg@@ gars . let them be sought from their ruins .
let my adversaries be clo@@ thed with dis@@ honor . let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will send forth the rod of your strength out of Z@@ ion . rule in the midst of your enemies .
the Lord is at your right hand . he will crush kings in the day of his wrath .
it is well with the man who deals gr@@ aci@@ ously and lends . he will maintain his cause in judgment .
his heart is established . he will not be afraid in the end when he sees his adversaries .
not to us , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , not to us , but to your name give glory , for your loving kindness , and for your truth 's sake .
Oh that my ways were stead@@ fast to obey your statutes !
then I w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t be disappointed , when I consider all of your commandments .
I will give thanks to you with upri@@ ghtness of heart , when I learn your righteous judgments .
I will observe your statutes . Don '@@ t utterly for@@ sake me .
how can a young man keep his way pure ? by living according to your word .
with my whole heart , I have sought you . Don '@@ t let me wander from your commandments .
blessed are you , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . teach me your statutes .
you have rebu@@ ked the proud who are cur@@ sed , who wander from your commandments .
my soul is weary with sorrow : strengthen me according to your word .
I have chosen the way of truth . I have set your ordin@@ ances before me .
I run in the path of your commandments , for you have set my heart free .
fulfill your promise to your servant , that you may be feared .
Don '@@ t s@@ nat@@ ch the word of truth out of my mouth , for I put my hope in your ordin@@ ances .
I will also speak of your statutes before kings , and will not be disappointed .
I reach out my hands for your commandments , which I love . I will meditate on your statutes .
I remember your ordin@@ ances of old , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and have comfor@@ ted myself .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is my portion . I promised to obey your words .
at midnight I will rise to give thanks to you , because of your righteous ordin@@ ances .
do good to your servant , according to your word , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
teach me good judgment and knowledge , for I believe in your commandments .
you are good , and do good . teach me your statutes .
it is good for me that I have been afflicted , that I may learn your statutes .
let the proud be disappointed , for they have overthrown me wrong@@ fully . I will meditate on your prec@@ epts .
your laws remain to this day , for all things serve you .
your commandments make me wis@@ er than my enemies , for your commandments are always with me .
I have not turned aside from your ordin@@ ances , for you have taught me .
how sweet are your promises to my taste , more than honey to my mouth !
I am afflicted very much . revive me , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , according to your word .
my soul is continually in my hand , yet I won '@@ t forget your law .
the wicked have laid a sn@@ are for me , yet I haven '@@ t gone astr@@ ay from your prec@@ epts .
my flesh trem@@ bles for fear of you . I am afraid of your judgments .
I have done what is just and righteous . Don '@@ t leave me to my op@@ pres@@ sors .
my eyes fail looking for your salvation , for your righteous word .
therefore I love your commandments more than gold , yes , more than pure gold .
my zeal wears me out , because my enemies ignore your words .
I am small and desp@@ ised . I don '@@ t forget your prec@@ epts .
trouble and angu@@ ish have taken hold of me . your commandments are my delight .
I have called with my whole heart . answer me , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ! I will keep your statutes .
salvation is far from the wicked , for they don '@@ t seek your statutes .
I have long@@ ed for your salvation , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . your law is my delight .
I have gone astr@@ ay like a lost sheep . seek your servant , for I don '@@ t forget your commandments .
he will not allow your foot to be moved . he who keeps you will not sl@@ umber .
peace be within your walls , and prosperity within your palaces .
for the scep@@ ter of w@@ ick@@ edness won '@@ t remain over the allo@@ tment of the righteous ; so that the righteous won '@@ t use their hands to do evil .
do good , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to those who are good , to those who are upright in their hearts .
happy is the man who has his qui@@ ver full of them . they won '@@ t be disappointed when they speak with their enemies in the gate .
for you will eat the labor of your hands . you will be happy , and it will be well with you .
your wife will be as a fruitful vine , in the in@@ ner@@ most parts of your house ; your children like olive plants , around your table .
may Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h bless you out of Z@@ ion , and may you see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life .
yes , may you see your children 's children . peace be upon Israel .
many times they have afflicted me from my youth up , yet they have not prevailed against me .
with which the re@@ aper do@@ es@@ n '@@ t fill his hand , nor he who bin@@ ds she@@ aves , his bos@@ om .
Lord , hear my voice . let your ears be attentive to the voice of my peti@@ tions .
I will not give sleep to my eyes , or sl@@ umber to my ey@@ eli@@ ds ;
arise , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , into your resting place ; you , and the ark of your strength .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will fulfill that which concerns me ; your loving kindness , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , endu@@ res forever . Don '@@ t for@@ sake the works of your own hands .
you search out my path and my lying down , and are acquainted with all my ways .
for there is not a word on my tongue , but , behold , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , you know it altogether .
where could I go from your Spirit ? or where could I flee from your presence ?
even the darkness do@@ es@@ n '@@ t hide from you , but the night shines as the day . the darkness is like light to you .
my frame was@@ n '@@ t hidden from you , when I was made in secret , woven together in the depths of the earth .
how precious to me are your thoughts , God ! how vast is their sum !
for they speak against you w@@ ick@@ edly . your enemies take your name in vain .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , don '@@ t I hate those who hate you ? am I not griev@@ ed with those who rise up against you ?
they have sharpen@@ ed their tongues like a ser@@ pent . vi@@ per 's poison is under their lips . Sel@@ ah .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the Lord , the strength of my salvation , you have covered my head in the day of battle .
let my prayer be set before you like inc@@ ense ; the lifting up of my hands like the evening sacrifice .
listen to my cry , for I am in desperate need@@ . deliver me from my persec@@ utors , For they are stronger than me .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; A Psal@@ m by David . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; He@@ ar my prayer , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . listen to my peti@@ tions . in your faith@@ fulness and righteousness , relieve me .
I remember the days of old . I meditate on all your do@@ ings . I contemplate the work of your hands .
hurry to answer me , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . my spirit fails . Don '@@ t hide your face from me , so that I don '@@ t become like those who go down into the pit .
cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning , for I trust in you . cause me to know the way in which I should walk , for I lift up my soul to you .
teach me to do your will , for you are my God . your Spirit is good . lead me in the land of upri@@ ghtness .
revive me , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , for your name 's sake . in your righteousness , bring my soul out of trouble .
I will sing a new song to you , God . on a ten @@@ -@@ @ str@@ ing@@ ed ly@@ re , I will sing pra@@ ises to you .
one generation will comm@@ end your works to another , and will declare your mighty acts .
they will utter the memory of your great goodness , and will sing of your righteousness .
the eyes of all wait for you . you give them their food in due season .
for he has strengthened the bars of your gates . he has blessed your children within you .
he has lifted up the horn of his people , the praise of all his saints ; even of the children of Israel , a people near to him . praise Y@@ ah !
let Israel rejoice in him who made them . let the children of Z@@ ion be joyful in their King .
let the saints rejoice in honor . let them sing for joy on their beds .
for they will be a gar@@ land to grace your head , and chains around your neck .
but you have ignored all my counsel , and wanted none of my re@@ proof ;
who are cro@@ oked in their ways , and way@@ ward in their paths :
my son , don '@@ t forget my teaching ; but let your heart keep my commandments :
trust in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h with all your heart , and don '@@ t lean on your own understanding .
it will be health to your body , and nour@@ ishment to your bones .
honor Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h with your substance , with the first fruits of all your increase :
so they will be life to your soul , and grace for your neck .
Don '@@ t say to your neighbor , " Go , and come again ; tomorrow I will give it to you , " when you have it by you .
for I was a son to my father , tender and an only child in the sight of my mother .
put away from yourself a perverse mouth . put corrupt lips far from you .
lest strangers feast on your wealth , and your lab@@ ors enrich another man 's house .
neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers , nor turned my ear to those who instructed me !
give no sleep to your eyes , nor sl@@ umber to your ey@@ eli@@ ds .
my son , keep your father 's commandment , and don '@@ t for@@ sake your mother 's teaching .
or can one walk on hot co@@ als , and his feet not be scor@@ ched ?
men don '@@ t desp@@ ise a thief , if he ste@@ als to satisfy himself when he is hungry :
he who commits adul@@ tery with a woman is void of understanding . he who does it destroys his own soul .
my son , keep my words . lay up my commandments within you .
tell wisdom , " You are my sister . " call understanding your relative ,
that they may keep you from the strange woman , from the foreigner who fl@@ atters with her words .
my fruit is better than gold , yes , than fine gold ; my yield than choice silver .
" Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h possessed me in the beginning of his work , before his deeds of old .
blessed is the man who hears me , watching daily at my gates , waiting at my door posts .
he who correc@@ ts a mo@@ cker invites insult . he who re@@ proves a wicked man invites abuse .
for by me your days will be multiplied . the years of your life will be increased .
if you are wise , you are wise for yourself . if you mo@@ ck , you alone will bear it .
people curse someone who with@@ holds grain , but blessing will be on the head of him who sells it .
better is he who is lightly este@@ em@@ ed , and has a servant , than he who honors himself , and lacks bread .
he who til@@ ls his land shall have plenty of bread , but he who ch@@ ases fantasies is void of understanding .
he who guards his mouth guards his soul . one who opens wide his lips comes to ruin .
whoever desp@@ ises instruction will pay for it , but he who respects a command will be rewarded .
one who sp@@ ares the rod h@@ ates his son , but one who loves him is careful to discipline him .
the un@@ faithful will be repaid for his own ways ; likewise a good man will be rewarded for his ways .
the poor person is shun@@ ned even by his own neighbor , but the rich person has many friends .
he who desp@@ ises his neighbor sins , but blessed is he who has pity on the poor .
a fool desp@@ ises his father 's correction , but he who he@@ eds re@@ proof shows prudence .
a wise son makes a father glad , but a foolish man desp@@ ises his mother .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has made everything for its own end@@ -- yes , even the wicked for the day of evil .
the highway of the upright is to depart from evil . he who keeps his way preserves his soul .
the appetite of the lab@@ oring man lab@@ ors for him ; for his mouth urges him on .
he who loves disobedience loves strife . one who builds a high gate seeks destruction .
he who becomes the father of a fool griev@@ es . the father of a fool has no joy .
a foolish son brings grief to his father , and bitterness to her who bore him .
he who gets wisdom loves his own soul . he who keeps understanding shall find good .
the slugg@@ ard bur@@ ies his hand in the dish ; he will not so much as bring it to his mouth again .
a king who sits on the throne of judgment sc@@ atters away all evil with his eyes .
whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor , he will also cry out , but shall not be heard .
whoever guards his mouth and his tongue keeps his soul from troubles .
thor@@ ns and sn@@ ares are in the path of the wicked : whoever guards his soul stays from them .
if you don '@@ t have means to pay , why should he take away your bed from under you ?
Don '@@ t move the ancient boundary stone , which your fathers have set up .
a wise man has great power ; and a knowledgeable man increases strength ;
for by wise guidance you wage your war ; and victory is in many advisors .
wisdom is too high for a fool : he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t open his mouth in the gate .
debate your case with your neighbor , and don '@@ t betray the confidence of another ;

the slugg@@ ard bur@@ ies his hand in the dish . he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth .
is the man who decei@@ ves his neighbor and says , " Am I not jo@@ king ? "
let another man praise you , and not your own mouth ; a stranger , and not your own lips .
perf@@ ume and inc@@ ense bring joy to the heart ; so does earnest counsel from a man 's friend .
restr@@ aining her is like restr@@ aining the wind , or like gras@@ ping oil in his right hand .
know well the state of your f@@ locks , and pay attention to your herds :
better is the poor who walks in his integrity , than he who is perverse in his ways , and he is rich .
he who turns away his ear from hearing the law , even his prayer is an ab@@ om@@ ination .

there is a generation that is pure in their own eyes , yet are not washed from their fil@@ thiness .

the ants are not a strong people , yet they provide their food in the summer .
Don '@@ t give your strength to women , nor your ways to that which destroys kings .

she rises also while it is yet night , gives food to her household , and portions for her servant girls .
she arms her waist with strength , and makes her arms strong .
she lays her hands to the dist@@ aff , and her hands hold the sp@@ ind@@ le .
I said to myself , " Be@@ hold , I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem . yes , my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge . "
for what has a man of all his labor , and of the striving of his heart , in which he lab@@ ors under the sun ?
there is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink , and make his soul enjoy good in his labor . this also I saw , that it is from the hand of God .
I said in my heart , " As for the sons of men , God tests them , so that they may see that they themselves are like animals .
the fool fol@@ ds his hands together and ruins himself .
Don '@@ t be rash with your mouth , and don '@@ t let your heart be ha@@ sty to utter anything before God ; for God is in heaven , and you on earth . therefore let your words be few .
Don '@@ t be overly righteous , neither make yourself overly wise . why should you destroy yourself ?
go your way@@ -@@ -@@ eat your bread with joy , and drink your wine with a mer@@ ry heart ; for God has already accepted your works .
in the morning sow your seed , and in the evening don '@@ t with@@ hold your hand ; for you don '@@ t know which will prosper , whether this or that , or whether they both will be equally good .

their land also is full of idols . they worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fingers have made .
the people will be oppressed , everyone by another , and everyone by his neighbor . the child will behave himself proudly against the old man , and the base against the honorable .
tell the righteous " Good ! " for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds .
let me sing for my well beloved a song of my beloved about his viney@@ ard . my beloved had a viney@@ ard on a very fruitful hill .
what could have been done more to my viney@@ ard , that I have not done in it ? why , when I looked for it to yield grapes , did it yield wild grapes ?

it happened , when king He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah heard it , that he t@@ ore his clothes , covered himself with s@@ ack@@ cloth , and went into Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's house .
this is the word which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken concerning him . the virgin daughter of Z@@ ion has desp@@ ised you and ridicul@@ ed you . the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you .
but I know your sitting down , your going out , your coming in , and your raging against me .
" go , and tell He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , ' Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of David your father , " I have heard your prayer . I have seen your tears . behold , I will add fifteen years to your life .
I said , " In the middle of my life I go into the gates of She@@ ol . I am deprived of the resi@@ due of my years . "
what will I say ? he has both spoken to me , and himself has done it . I will walk carefully all my years because of the angu@@ ish of my soul .

'@@ Be@@ hold , the days are coming when all that is in your house , and that which your fathers have stored up until this day , will be carried to Babylon . nothing will be left , ' says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
for I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , will hold your right hand , saying to you , ' Don '@@ t be afraid . I will help you . '
but now thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h who created you , Jacob , and he who formed you , Israel : " Don '@@ t be afraid , for I have re@@ deemed you . I have called you by your name . you are mine .
for I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , the Holy One of Israel , your Savior . I have given Egypt as your ran@@ som , Ethiopia and Se@@ ba in your place .
since you have been precious and honored in my sight , and I have loved you ; therefore I will give people in your place , and nations instead of your life .
the people which I formed for myself , that they might set forth my praise .
you have not brought me of your sheep for burnt offerings ; neither have you honored me with your sacrifices . I have not burdened you with offerings , nor wear@@ ied you with frank@@ inc@@ ense .
you have bought me no sweet cane with money , nor have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices ; but you have burdened me with your sins . you have wear@@ ied me with your ini@@ qu@@ ities .
for I will pour water on him who is thir@@ sty , and streams on the dry ground . I will pour my Spirit on your seed , and my blessing on your offspring :
he feeds on ashes . a deceived heart has turned him aside ; and he can '@@ t deliver his soul , nor say , " is@@ n '@@ t there a lie in my right hand ? "
who says to the deep , ' Be dry , ' and ' I will dry up your rivers ; '
I have made the earth , and created man on it . I , even my hands , have stretched out the heavens ; and I have commanded all their army .
you said , ' I shall be a mistress forever ; ' so that you did not lay these things to your heart , nor did you remember the latter end of it .
" now therefore hear this , you who are given to pleasures , who sit securely , who say in your heart , ' I am , and there is none else besides me ; I shall not sit as a widow , neither shall I know the loss of children : '
" stand now with your enchan@@ tments , and with the multitude of your sorcer@@ ies , in which you have lab@@ ored from your youth ; if so be you shall be able to profit , if so be you may prevail .
behold , they shall be as stub@@ ble ; the fire shall burn them ; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame : it shall not be a coal to warm at , nor a fire to sit before .
for my own sake , for my own sake , will I do it ; for how should my name be prof@@ an@@ ed ? I will not give my glory to another .
your seed also had been as the sand , and the offspring of your body like its grains : his name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before me .
and he said to me , " You are my servant ; Israel , in whom I will be glori@@ fied . "
" can a woman forget her nursing child , that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb ? yes , these may forget , yet I will not forget you !
but thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " Even the cap@@ tives of the mighty shall be taken away , and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered ; for I will contend with him who cont@@ ends with you , and I will save your children .
thus says your Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and your God who ple@@ ads the cause of his people , " Be@@ hold , I have taken out of your hand the cup of staggering , even the bowl of the cup of my wrath ; you shall no more drink it again :

the voice of your watch@@ men ! they lift up the voice , together do they sing ; for they shall see eye to eye , when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h returns to Z@@ ion .
like as many were astonished at you ( his appearance was mar@@ red more than any man , and his form more than the sons of men ) ,
so shall he sprink@@ le many nations ; kings shall shut their mouths at him : for that which had not been told them shall they see ; and that which they had not heard shall they understand .
he was desp@@ ised , and rejected by men ; a man of suffering , and acquainted with disease . he was desp@@ ised as one from whom men hide their face ; and we did@@ n '@@ t respect him .
surely he has borne our sickness , and carried our suffering ; yet we considered him plagued , struck by God , and afflicted .
he was oppressed , yet when he was afflicted he did@@ n '@@ t open his mouth . as a lamb that is led to the slaughter , and as a sheep that before its sh@@ ear@@ ers is mute , so he did@@ n '@@ t open his mouth .
after the suffering of his soul , he will see the light and be satisfied . my righteous servant will justify many by the knowledge of himself ; and he will bear their ini@@ qu@@ ities .
" Don '@@ t be afraid ; for you shall not be ashamed : neither be conf@@ ounded ; for you shall not be disappointed : for you shall forget the shame of your youth ; and the repro@@ ach of your wi@@ do@@ wh@@ ood you shall remember no more .
behold , they may gather together , but not by me : whoever shall gather together against you shall fall because of you .
let the wicked for@@ sake his way , and the un@@ righteous man his thoughts ; and let him return to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and he will have mercy on him ; and to our God , for he will ab@@ und@@ antly pardon .
blessed is the man who does this , and the son of man who holds it fast ; who keeps the Sabbath from prof@@ aning it , and keeps his hand from doing any evil . "
yet they seek me daily , and delight to know my ways : as a nation that did righteousness , and did@@ n '@@ t for@@ sake the ordin@@ ance of their God , they ask of me righteous judgments ; they delight to draw near to God .
he put on righteousness as a breast@@ plate , and a helmet of salvation on his head ; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing , and was cl@@ ad with zeal as a mantle .
" who are these who fly as a cloud , and as the d@@ oves to their windows ?
violence shall no more be heard in your land , des@@ ol@@ ation nor destruction within your borders ; but you shall call your walls Sal@@ vation , and your gates P@@ raise .
your sun shall no more go down , neither shall your moon withdraw itself ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will be your everlasting light , and the days of your mourning shall be ended .
instead of your shame you shall have double ; and instead of dis@@ honor they shall rejoice in their portion : therefore in their land they shall possess double ; everlasting joy shall be to them .
why are you red in your clothing , and your garments like him who t@@ reads in the wine v@@ at ?
then he remembered the days of old , Moses and his people , saying , Where is he who brought them up out of the sea with the shep@@ herds of his flock ? where is he who put his holy Spirit in their midst ?
look down from heaven , and see from the hab@@ itation of your hol@@ iness and of your glory : where are your zeal and your mighty acts ? the yearning of your heart and your compassion is restrained toward me .
for you are our Father , though Abraham do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know us , and Israel does not acknowledge us : you , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , are our Father ; our Re@@ deem@@ er from everlasting is your name .
as when fire kind@@ les the br@@ ush@@ wood , and the fire causes the waters to boil ; to make your name known to your adversaries , that the nations may trem@@ ble at your presence !
for from of old men have not heard , nor perceived by the ear , neither has the eye seen a God besides you , who works for him who waits for him .
there is none who calls on your name , who stir@@ s up himself to take hold of you ; for you have hidden your face from us , and have consumed us by means of our ini@@ qu@@ ities .
so that he who bl@@ esses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth ; and he who sw@@ ears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth ; because the former troubles are forgotten , and because they are hidden from my eyes .
a voice of tum@@ ult from the city , a voice from the temple , a voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h that renders re@@ comp@@ ense to his enemies .
for , behold , I will call all the families of the king@@ doms of the north , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; " and they shall come , and they shall each set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem , and against all its walls all around , and against all the cities of Jud@@ ah .
they will fight against you ; but they will not prevail against you ; for I am with you , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " to deliver you . "
has a nation changed its gods , which really are no gods ? but my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit .
" haven '@@ t you proc@@ ured this to yourself , in that you have for@@ s@@ aken Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , when he led you by the way ?
" how can you say , ' I am not de@@ filed . I have not gone after the Ba@@ als ' ? see your way in the valley . know what you have done . you are a swift dro@@ med@@ ary tra@@ vers@@ ing her ways ;
" with@@ hold your foot from being un@@ sh@@ od , and your throat from thirst . but you said , ' It is in vain . no , for I have loved strangers , and I will go after them . '
" but where are your gods that you have made for yourselves ? let them arise , if they can save you in the time of your trouble : for according to the number of your cities are your gods , Jud@@ ah .
" can a virgin forget her ornam@@ ents , or a bride her at@@ tire ? yet my people have forgotten me for days without number .
" lift up your eyes to the bare heights , and see ! where have you not been lain with ? you have sat for them by the ways , as an Arabian in the wilderness . you have polluted the land with your prostitution and with your w@@ ick@@ edness .
yet for all this her treach@@ erous sister , Jud@@ ah , has not returned to me with her whole heart , but only in pre@@ tense , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
" surely as a wife treach@@ er@@ ously de@@ parts from her husband , so you have dealt treach@@ er@@ ously with me , house of Israel , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
circum@@ c@@ ise yourselves to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and take away the fores@@ kins of your heart , you men of Jud@@ ah and inhabitants of Jerusalem ; lest my wrath go forth like fire , and burn so that none can qu@@ en@@ ch it , because of the evil of your do@@ ings .
a lion is gone up from his th@@ icket , and a destro@@ yer of nations ; he is on his way , he is gone forth from his place , to make your land des@@ ol@@ ate , that your cities be laid waste , without inhabit@@ ant .
then I said , " Su@@ rely these are poor . they are foolish ; for they don '@@ t know the way of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , nor the law of their God .
therefore thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Arm@@ ies , " Because you speak this word , behold , I will make my words in your mouth fire , and this people wood , and it shall dev@@ our them .
neither do they say in their heart , ' Let us now fear Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God , who gives rain , both the former and the latter , in its season ; who preserves to us the appointed weeks of the harvest . '
as a well casts forth its waters , so she casts forth her w@@ ick@@ edness : violence and destruction is heard in her ; before me continually is sickness and wounds .
hear , earth ! behold , I will bring evil on this people , even the fruit of their thoughts , because they have not listened to my words ; and as for my law , they have rejected it .
" I have made you a t@@ ester of metals and a fortress among my people ; that you may know and try their way .
do they provoke me to anger ? says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . Don '@@ t they provoke themselves , to the confusion of their own faces ?
for the children of Jud@@ ah have done that which is evil in my sight , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : they have set their ab@@ om@@ inations in the house which is called by my name , to def@@ ile it .
they have built the high places of T@@ oph@@ eth , which is in the valley of the son of H@@ inno@@ m , to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire ; which I did@@ n '@@ t command , nor did it come into my mind .
yes , the stor@@ k in the sky knows her appointed times ; and the tur@@ t@@ le@@ do@@ ve and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming ; but my people don '@@ t know Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's law .
they bend their tongue , as their bow , for false@@ hood ; and they are grown strong in the land , but not for truth : for they proceed from evil to evil , and they don '@@ t know me , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
every man has become bru@@ tish and without knowledge ; every g@@ old@@ sm@@ ith is disappointed by his engra@@ ved image ; for his mol@@ ten image is false@@ hood , and there is no breath in them .
w@@ oe is me because of my hurt ! my wound is griev@@ ous : but I said , Tru@@ ly this is my grief , and I must bear it .
my tent is destroyed , and all my cor@@ ds are broken : my children are gone forth from me , and they are no more : there is none to spread my tent any more , and to set up my curtains .
therefore don '@@ t pray for this people , neither lift up cry nor prayer for them ; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry to me because of their trouble .
but you , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , know me ; you see me , and try my heart toward you : pull them out like sheep for the slaughter , and prepare them for the day of slaughter .
can the Ethiopian change his skin , or the le@@ op@@ ard his spots ? then may you also do good , who are accustomed to do evil .
I have seen your ab@@ om@@ inations , even your adul@@ ter@@ ies , and your neigh@@ ing , the le@@ w@@ dness of your prostitution , on the hills in the field . w@@ oe to you , Jerusalem ! you will not be made clean ; how long shall it yet be ?
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to this people , Even so have they loved to wander ; they have not ref@@ rained their feet : therefore Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h does not accept them ; now he will remember their ini@@ qu@@ ity , and visit their sins .
do not abh@@ or us , for your name 's sake ; do not dis@@ grace the throne of your glory : remember , don '@@ t break your covenant with us .
then Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to me , Th@@ ough Moses and Samuel stood before me , yet my mind would not be toward this people : cast them out of my sight , and let them go forth .
you have rejected me , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , you have gone backward : therefore have I stretched out my hand against you , and destroyed you ; I am weary with rep@@ enting .
I have win@@ now@@ ed them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I have ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed them of children , I have destroyed my people ; they did@@ n '@@ t return from their ways .
your substance and your treasures will I give for a spoil without price , and that for all your sins , even in all your borders .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , you know ; remember me , and visit me , and av@@ enge me of my persec@@ utors ; don '@@ t take me away in your long@@ suffering : know that for your sake I have suffered repro@@ ach .
your words were found , and I ate them ; and your words were to me a joy and the rejo@@ icing of my heart : for I am called by your name , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , God of Arm@@ ies .
I will make you to this people a fortified bronze wall ; and they shall fight against you , but they shall not prevail against you ; for I am with you to save you and to deliver you , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
first I will re@@ comp@@ ense their ini@@ qu@@ ity and their sin double , because they have polluted my land with the car@@ c@@ asses of their det@@ est@@ able things , and have filled my inheritance with their ab@@ om@@ inations .
while their children remember their al@@ t@@ ars and their Ash@@ eri@@ m by the green trees on the high hills .
my mountain in the field , I will give your substance and all your treasures for a spoil , and your high places , because of sin , throughout all your borders .
as for me , I have not hur@@ ried from being a shepherd after you ; neither have I desired the wo@@ eful day ; you know : that which came out of my lips was before your face .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , Take heed to yourselves , and bear no burden on the Sabbath day , nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem ;
if that nation , concerning which I have spoken , turn from their evil , I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them .
yet , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , you know all their counsel against me to kill me ; don '@@ t forgive their ini@@ qu@@ ity , neither b@@ lot out their sin from your sight ; but let them be overthrown before you ; deal you with them in the time of your anger .
thus said Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , Go , and buy a pot@@ ter 's ear@@ then bottle , and take some of the elders of the people , and of the elders of the priests ;
you , Pash@@ hu@@ r , and all who dwell in your house shall go into cap@@ tivity ; and you shall come to Babylon , and there you shall die , and there you shall be buried , you , and all your friends , to whom you have prophe@@ si@@ ed fal@@ sely .
then they shall answer , Because they for@@ s@@ ook the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God , and worshi@@ ped other gods , and served them .
Don '@@ t we@@ ep for the dead , neither b@@ emo@@ an him ; but we@@ ep bit@@ terly for him who goes away ; for he shall return no more , nor see his native country .
for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h touching Sh@@ all@@ um the son of Jo@@ si@@ ah , king of Jud@@ ah , who re@@ igned instead of Jo@@ si@@ ah his father , and who went forth out of this place : he shall not return there any more .
who says , I will build me a wide house and spacious rooms , and cuts him out windows ; and it is ceiling with c@@ edar , and painted with ver@@ mil@@ ion .
go up to Lebanon , and cry ; and lift up your voice in Bash@@ an , and cry from Ab@@ ari@@ m ; for all your lovers are destroyed .
I spoke to you in your prosperity ; but you said , I will not hear . this has been your way from your youth , that you did@@ n '@@ t obey my voice .
the wind shall feed all your shep@@ herds , and your lovers shall go into cap@@ tivity : surely then you will be ashamed and conf@@ ounded for all your w@@ ick@@ edness .
w@@ oe to the shep@@ herds who destroy and sc@@ atter the sheep of my past@@ ure ! says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
who think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor , as their fathers forgot my name for Ba@@ al .
therefore , behold , I will utterly forget you , and I will cast you off , and the city that I gave to you and to your fathers , away from my presence :
I will give them a heart to know me , that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God ; for they shall return to me with their whole heart .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has sent to you all his servants the prophets , rising up early and sending them ( but you have not listened , nor inclined your ear to hear )
saying , Return now everyone from his evil way , and from the evil of your do@@ ings , and dwell in the land that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has given to you and to your fathers , from of old and even fore@@ ver@@ more ;
it shall happen , when seventy years are accomplished , that I will punish the king of Babylon , and that nation , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , for their ini@@ qu@@ ity , and the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; and I will make it des@@ ol@@ ate forever .
for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to me : take this cup of the wine of wrath at my hand , and cause all the nations , to whom I send you , to drink it .
it shall be , if they refuse to take the cup at your hand to drink , then you shall tell them , Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies : you shall surely drink .
it may be they will listen , and turn every man from his evil way ; that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their do@@ ings .
but as for me , behold , I am in your hand : do with me as is good and right in your eyes .
only know for certain that , if you put me to death , you will bring innocent blood on yourselves , and on this city , and on its inhabitants ; for of a truth Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to me : make bonds and bars , and put them on your neck ;
because they have worked folly in Israel , and have committed adul@@ tery with their neighbors ' wives , and have spoken words in my name fal@@ sely , which I did@@ n '@@ t command them ; and I am he who knows , and am witness , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
thus speaks Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , saying , Write all the words that I have spoken to you in a book .
it shall come to pass in that day , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , that I will break his y@@ oke from off your neck , and will burst your bonds ; and strangers shall no more make him their bond@@ servant ;
but they shall serve Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God , and David their king , whom I will raise up to them .
for I am with you , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to save you : for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you , but I will not make a full end of you ; but I will correct you in measure , and will in no way leave you un@@ punished .
there is none to ple@@ ad your cause , that you may be bound up : you have no healing medicines .
why do you cry for your hurt ? your pain is incur@@ able : for the greatness of your ini@@ qu@@ ity , because your sins were increased , I have done these things to you .
their prince shall be of themselves , and their ruler shall proceed from their midst ; and I will cause him to draw near , and he shall approach to me : for who is he who has had bold@@ ness to approach to me ? says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
hear the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , you nations , and declare it in the islands af@@ ar off ; and say , He who scattered Israel will gather him , and keep him , as shepherd does his flock .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : a voice is heard in Ram@@ ah , lam@@ entation , and bitter we@@ eping , Rach@@ el we@@ eping for her children ; she refuses to be comfor@@ ted for her children , because they are no more .
but everyone shall die for his own ini@@ qu@@ ity : every man who eats the sour grapes , his teeth shall be set on edge .
Ah Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ! behold , you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your out@@ stretched arm ; there is nothing too hard for you ,
for this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
but they set their ab@@ om@@ inations in the house which is called by my name , to def@@ ile it .
behold , I will gather them out of all the countries , where I have driven them in my anger , and in my wrath , and in great indignation ; and I will bring them again to this place , and I will cause them to dwell safely :
and I will give them one heart and one way , that they may fear me forever , for their good , and of their children after them :
yes , I will rejoice over them to do them good , and I will plant them in this land assu@@ re@@ dly with my whole heart and with my whole soul .
that every man should let his male servant , and every man his female servant , who is a Hebrew or a He@@ bre@@ w@@ ess , go free ; that none should make bond@@ servants of them , of a Jew his brother .
all the princes and all the people obeyed , who had entered into the covenant , that everyone should let his male servant , and everyone his female servant , go free , that none should make bond@@ servants of them any more ; they obeyed , and let them go :
you had now turned , and had done that which is right in my eyes , in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor ; and you had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name :
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , the God of Israel : go , and tell the men of Jud@@ ah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , Will you not receive instruction to listen to my words ? says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
it may be that the house of Jud@@ ah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them ; that they may return every man from his evil way ; that I may forgive their ini@@ qu@@ ity and their sin .
they were not afraid , nor t@@ ore their garments , neither the king , nor any of his servants who heard all these words .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , You shall tell the king of Jud@@ ah , who sent you to me to inqu@@ ire of me : behold , Phar@@ aoh 's army , which has come forth to help you , shall return to Egypt into their own land .
so E@@ bed@@ m@@ elec@@ h took the men with him , and went into the house of the king under the treasury , and took there r@@ ags and worn @@@ -@@ @ out garments , and let them down by cor@@ ds into the dun@@ geon to Jer@@ emi@@ ah .
then Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the king sent , and took Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : and the king said to Jer@@ emi@@ ah , I will ask you something . hide nothing from me .
so Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the king s@@ wore secretly to Jer@@ emi@@ ah , saying , As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , who made us this soul , I will not put you to death , neither will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life .
they shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; and you shall not escape out of their hand , but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon : and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire .
it happened when Jerusalem was taken , ( in the ninth year of Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , in the tenth month , came Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem , and be@@ sieg@@ ed it ;
then called he Johan@@ an the son of Kare@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces who were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
and tell them , Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , the God of Israel : behold , I will send and take Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king of Babylon , my servant , and will set his throne on these stones that I have hidden ; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them .
they are not hum@@ bled even to this day , neither have they feared , nor walked in my law , nor in my statutes , that I set before you and before your fathers .
you said , W@@ oe is me now ! for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has added sorrow to my pain ; I am weary with my gro@@ aning , and I find no rest .
Don '@@ t you be afraid , O Jacob my servant , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; for I am with you : for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have driven you ; but I will not make a full end of you , but I will correct you in measure , and will in no way leave you un@@ punished .
at the noise of the stam@@ ping of the hoo@@ fs of his strong ones , at the rushing of his ch@@ ari@@ ots , at the rum@@ bling of his wheels , the fathers don '@@ t look back to their children for fee@@ bl@@ eness of hands ;
Mo@@ ab has been at ease from his youth , and he has settled on his le@@ es , and has not been emp@@ tied from vessel to vessel , neither has he gone into cap@@ tivity : therefore his taste remains in him , and his scent is not changed .
with more than the we@@ eping of J@@ az@@ er will I we@@ ep for you , vine of Sib@@ ma@@ h : your branches passed over the sea , they reached even to the sea of J@@ az@@ er : on your summer fruits and on your v@@ intage the destro@@ yer is fallen .
from the cry of H@@ esh@@ bon even to Ele@@ al@@ eh , even to Ja@@ haz have they uttered their voice , from Zo@@ ar even to Hor@@ on@@ aim , to E@@ gl@@ ath Shel@@ is@@ hi@@ yah : for the waters of N@@ im@@ rim also shall become des@@ ol@@ ate .
for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , he shall fly as an eagle , and shall spread out his wings against Mo@@ ab .
fear , and the pit , and the sn@@ are , are on you , inhabit@@ ant of Mo@@ ab , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
why do you glory in the valleys , your flowing valley , back@@ sliding daughter ? who trusted in her treasures , saying , Who shall come to me ?
leave your fa@@ ther@@ less children , I will preserve them alive ; and let your wid@@ ows trust in me .
my people have been lost sheep : their shep@@ herds have caused them to go astr@@ ay ; they have turned them away on the mountains ; they have gone from mountain to hill ; they have forgotten their resting place .
all who found them have dev@@ oured them ; and their adversaries said , We are not guilty , because they have sin@@ ned against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the hab@@ itation of righteousness , even Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the hope of their fathers .
cut off the s@@ ower from Babylon , and him who handles the sick@@ le in the time of harvest : for fear of the op@@ pressing sword they shall turn everyone to his people , and they shall flee everyone to his own land .
I have laid a sn@@ are for you , and you are also taken , Babylon , and you wer@@ en '@@ t aware : you are found , and also caught , because you have stri@@ ven against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and save every man his life ; don '@@ t be cut off in her ini@@ qu@@ ity : for it is the time of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's vengeance ; he will render to her a re@@ comp@@ ense .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies has sworn by himself , saying , Su@@ rely I will fill you with men , as with the can@@ ker worm ; and they shall lift up a shout against you .
every man has become bru@@ tish without knowledge . every g@@ old@@ sm@@ ith is disappointed by his image ; for his mol@@ ten image is false@@ hood , and there is no breath in them .
behold , I am against you , destroying mountain , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which destroys all the earth ; and I will stretch out my hand on you , and roll you down from the rocks , and will make you a burnt mountain .
therefore thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , I will ple@@ ad your cause , and take vengeance for you ; and I will dry up her sea , and make her fountain dry .
my people , go away from the midst of her , and save yourselves every man from the fierce anger of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
though Babylon should mount up to the sky , and though she should forti@@ fy the height of her strength , yet from me shall destroyers come to her , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
and changed his prison garments . Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in ate bread before him continually all the days of his life :
all her people sigh , they seek bread ; they have given their pleasant things for food to refresh the soul : look , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and see ; for I am become ab@@ ject .
Z@@ ion spreads forth her hands ; there is none to comfort her ; Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has commanded concerning Jacob , that those who are around him should be his adversaries : Jerusalem is among them as an un@@ clean thing .
I called for my lovers , but they deceived me : my priests and my elders gave up the spirit in the city , While they sought them food to refresh their souls .
they tell their mothers , Where is grain and wine ? when they sw@@ oon as the wounded in the streets of the city , When their soul is poured out into their mothers ' bos@@ om .
all your enemies have opened their mouth wide against you ; They h@@ iss and gn@@ ash the teeth ; they say , We have swallowed her up ; Cer@@ tain@@ ly this is the day that we looked for ; we have found , we have seen it .
their heart cried to the Lord : wall of the daughter of Z@@ ion , let tears run down like a river day and night ; Gi@@ ve yourself no resp@@ ite ; don '@@ t let the apple of your eye cease .
it is good for a man that he bear the y@@ oke in his youth .
to crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth ,
why does a living man complain , a man for the punishment of his sins ?
all our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us .
waters flowed over my head ; I said , I am cut off .
you heard my voice ; don '@@ t hide your ear at my breathing , at my cry .
Lord , you have ple@@ aded the causes of my soul ; you have re@@ deemed my life .
the hands of the p@@ iti@@ ful women have boiled their own children ; They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
the punishment of your ini@@ qu@@ ity is accomplished , daughter of Z@@ ion ; he will no more carry you away into cap@@ tivity : he will visit your ini@@ qu@@ ity , daughter of E@@ dom ; he will un@@ cover your sins .
turn us to yourself , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and we shall be turned . renew our days as of old .
each one went straight forward : where the spirit was to go , they went ; they did@@ n '@@ t turn when they went .
not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language , whose words you can not understand . surely , if I sent you to them , they would listen to you .
then the Spirit lifted me up , and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing , saying , Bless@@ ed be the glory of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h from his place .
yet if you warn the wicked , and he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t turn from his w@@ ick@@ edness , nor from his wicked way , he shall die in his ini@@ qu@@ ity ; but you have delivered your soul .
nevertheless if you warn the righteous man , that the righteous not sin , and he does not sin , he shall surely live , because he took warning ; and you have delivered your soul .
then I arose , and went forth into the plain : and behold , the glory of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h stood there , as the glory which I saw by the river Che@@ bar ; and I fell on my face .
then the Spirit entered into me , and set me on my feet ; and he spoke with me , and said to me , Go , shut yourself inside your house .
but you , son of man , behold , they shall lay bands on you , and shall bind you with them , and you shall not go out among them :
you also , son of man , take a tile , and lay it before yourself , and portray on it a city , even Jerusalem :
again , when you have accomplished these , you shall lie on your right side , and shall bear the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the house of Jud@@ ah : forty days , each day for a year , have I appointed it to you .
behold , I lay bands on you , and you shall not turn you from one side to the other , until you have accomplished the days of your siege .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread un@@ clean , among the nations where I will drive them .
that they may want bread and water , and be dis@@ may@@ ed one with another , and pine away in their ini@@ qu@@ ity .
you , son of man , take a sharp sword ; You shall take it as a bar@@ ber 's ra@@ zor to you , and shall cause it to pass on your head and on your beard : then take balances to weigh , and divide the hair .
you shall take of it a few in number , and bind them in your skirts .
she has reb@@ elled against my ordin@@ ances in doing w@@ ick@@ edness more than the nations , and against my statutes more than the countries that are around her ; for they have rejected my ordin@@ ances , and as for my statutes , they have not walked in them .
therefore thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , I , even I , am against you ; and I will execute judgments in the midst of you in the sight of the nations .
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of you , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments on you ; and the whole remn@@ ant of you will I sc@@ atter to all the winds .
thus shall my anger be accomplished , and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest , and I shall be comfor@@ ted ; and they shall know that I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have spoken in my zeal , when I have accomplished my wrath on them .
now is the end on you , and I will send my anger on you , and will judge you according to your ways ; and I will bring on you all your ab@@ om@@ inations .
now will I shortly pour out my wrath on you , and accomplish my anger against you , and will judge you according to your ways ; and I will bring on you all your ab@@ om@@ inations .
therefore will I also deal in wrath ; my eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity ; and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice , yet will I not hear them .
then he cried in my ears with a loud voice , saying , C@@ ause those who are in charge of the city to draw near , every man with his destroying weapon in his hand .
it happened , while they were sm@@ iting , and I was left , that I fell on my face , and cried , and said , Ah Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ! will you destroy all the resi@@ due of Israel in your pouring out of your wrath on Jerusalem ?
the cher@@ u@@ b stretched forth his hand from between the cher@@ ub@@ im to the fire that was between the cher@@ ub@@ im , and took of it , and put it into the hands of him who was clo@@ thed in linen , who took it and went out .
when the cher@@ ub@@ im went , the wheels went beside them ; and when the cher@@ ub@@ im lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth , the wheels also did@@ n '@@ t turn from beside them .
dig through the wall in their sight , and carry your stuff out that way .
the prince who is among them shall bear on his shoulder in the dark , and shall go forth : they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby : he shall cover his face , because he shall not see the land with his eyes .
because with lies you have griev@@ ed the heart of the righteous , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the wicked , that he should not return from his wicked way , and be saved alive :
then came certain of the elders of Israel to me , and sat before me .
son of man , these men have taken their idols into their heart , and put the stumbling block of their ini@@ qu@@ ity before their face : should I be inqui@@ red of at all by them ?
that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart , because they are all e@@ strang@@ ed from me through their idols .
for thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : how much more when I send my four severe judgments on Jerusalem , the sword , and the famine , and the evil animals , and the pesti@@ l@@ ence , to cut off from it man and animal !
I put a ring on your nose , and ear@@ rings in your ears , and a beautiful crown on your head .
your renow@@ n went forth among the nations for your beauty ; for it was perfect , through my maj@@ esty which I had put on you , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters , whom you have borne to me , and you have sacrificed these to them to be dev@@ oured . was your prostitution a small matter ,
in all your ab@@ om@@ inations and your prostitution you have not remembered the days of your youth , when you were naked and bare , and were w@@ allowing in your blood .
it has happened after all your w@@ ick@@ edness , ( w@@ oe , w@@ oe to you ! says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ) ,
in that you build your v@@ aulted place at the head of every way , and make your lofty place in every street , and have not been as a pro@@ stitute , in that you scor@@ n pay .
they give gifts to all prostitutes ; but you give your gifts to all your lovers , and bribe them , that they may come to you on every side for your prostitution .
so will I cause my wrath toward you to rest , and my jealousy shall depart from you , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
you are the daughter of your mother , who lo@@ ath@@ es her husband and her children ; and you are the sister of your sisters , who lo@@ athed their husbands and their children : your mother was a Hit@@ tite , and your father an A@@ mor@@ ite .
your elder sister is Sam@@ aria , who d@@ wells at your left hand , she and her daughters ; and your younger sister , who d@@ wells at your right hand , is So@@ dom and her daughters .
behold , this was the ini@@ qu@@ ity of your sister So@@ dom : pride , full@@ ness of bread , and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters ; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and ne@@ edy .
neither has Sam@@ aria committed half of your sins ; but you have multiplied your ab@@ om@@ inations more than they , and have justified your sisters by all your ab@@ om@@ inations which you have done .
I will turn again their cap@@ tivity , the cap@@ tivity of So@@ dom and her daughters , and the cap@@ tivity of Sam@@ aria and her daughters , and the cap@@ tivity of your cap@@ tives in their midst ;
for your sister So@@ dom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride ,
nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth , and I will establish to you an everlasting covenant .
then you shall remember your ways , and be ashamed , when you shall receive your sisters , your elder [ sisters ] and your younger ; and I will give them to you for daughters , but not by your covenant .
there was also another great eagle with great wings and many fe@@ athers : and behold , this vine bent its roots toward him , and shot forth its branches toward him , from the beds of its plantation , that he might water it .
say now to the rebelli@@ ous house , Don '@@ t you know what these things mean ? tell them , Be@@ hold , the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem , and took its king , and its princes , and brought them to him to Babylon :
and he took of the seed royal , and made a covenant with him ; he also brought him under an oath , and took away the mighty of the land ;
but he reb@@ elled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt , that they might give him horses and many people . shall he prosper ? shall he escape who does such things ? shall he break the covenant , and yet escape ?
for he has desp@@ ised the oath by breaking the covenant ; and behold , he had given his hand , and yet has done all these things ; he shall not escape .
and has not eaten on the mountains , neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , neither has de@@ filed his neighbor 's wife , neither has come near to a woman in her imp@@ urity ,
he who has not given forth on interest , neither has taken any increase , who has withdrawn his hand from ini@@ qu@@ ity , has executed true justice between man and man ,
who has withdrawn his hand from the poor , who has not received interest nor increase , has executed my ordin@@ ances , has walked in my statutes ; he shall not die for the ini@@ qu@@ ity of his father , he shall surely live .
but if the wicked turn from all his sins that he has committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked ? says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and not rather that he should return from his way , and live ?
again , when the wicked man turns away from his w@@ ick@@ edness that he has committed , and does that which is lawful and right , he shall save his soul alive .
because he considers , and turns away from all his trans@@ gres@@ sions that he has committed , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
yet the house of Israel says , " The way of the Lord is not fair . " house of Israel , are@@ n '@@ t my ways fair ? are@@ n '@@ t your ways unfair ?
cast away from you all your trans@@ gres@@ sions , in which you have trans@@ g@@ ressed ; and make yourself a new heart and a new spirit : for why will you die , house of Israel ?
now when she saw that she had waited , and her hope was lost , then she took another of her c@@ ubs , and made him a young lion .
it had strong rods for the scep@@ ters of those who bore rule , and their stature was exalted among the thick b@@ ough@@ s , and they were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches .
because they had not executed my ordin@@ ances , but had rejected my statutes , and had prof@@ an@@ ed my Sab@@ baths , and their eyes were after their fathers ' idols .
therefore tell the house of Israel , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : do you poll@@ ute yourselves in the way of your fathers ? and do you play the pro@@ stitute after their ab@@ om@@ inations ?
I will pour out my indignation on you ; I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath ; and I will deliver you into the hand of bru@@ tish men , skillful to destroy .
you shall say , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : a city that sheds blood in the midst of her , that her time may come , and that makes idols against herself to def@@ ile her !
behold , the princes of Israel , everyone according to his power , have been in you to shed blood .
in you have they uncovered their fathers ' n@@ ak@@ edness ; in you have they hum@@ bled her who was un@@ clean in her imp@@ urity .
behold , therefore , I have struck my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made , and at your blood which has been in the midst of you .
I will sc@@ atter you among the nations , and disper@@ se you through the countries ; and I will consume your fil@@ thiness out of you .
you shall be prof@@ an@@ ed in yourself , in the sight of the nations ; and you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
O@@ hol@@ ah played the pro@@ stitute when she was mine ; and she do@@ ted on her lovers , on the As@@ sy@@ rians [ her ] neighbors ,
she increased her prostitution ; for she saw men portrayed on the wall , the images of the Chal@@ de@@ ans portrayed with ver@@ mil@@ ion ,
as soon as she saw them she do@@ ted on them , and sent messengers to them into Chal@@ dea .
so she uncovered her prostitution , and uncovered her n@@ ak@@ edness : then my soul was alienated from her , like as my soul was alienated from her sister .
therefore , O@@ hol@@ i@@ ba@@ h , thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , I will raise up your lovers against you , from whom your soul is alienated , and I will bring them against you on every side :
thus will I make your le@@ w@@ dness to cease from you , and your prostitution [ brought ] from the land of Egypt ; so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them , nor remember Egypt any more .
and they shall deal with you in hatred , and shall take away all your labor , and shall leave you naked and bare ; and the n@@ ak@@ edness of your prostitution shall be uncovered , both your le@@ w@@ dness and your prostitution .
you shall be filled with drun@@ ken@@ ness and sorrow , with the cup of aston@@ ishment and des@@ ol@@ ation , with the cup of your sister Sam@@ aria .
for when they had sl@@ ain their children to their idols , then they came the same day into my sanctuary to prof@@ ane it ; and behold , thus have they done in the midst of my house .
son of man , write the name of the day , [ even ] of this same day : the king of Babylon drew close to Jerusalem this same day .
I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it : it shall happen , and I will do it : I will not go back , neither will I spare , neither will I repent ; according to your ways , and according to your do@@ ings , shall they judge you , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
son of man , behold , I will take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke : yet you shall neither mour@@ n nor we@@ ep , neither shall your tears run down .
therefore , behold , I will deliver you to the children of the east for a possession , and they shall set their enc@@ amp@@ ments in you , and make their dwell@@ ings in you ; they shall eat your fruit , and they shall drink your milk .
therefore , behold , I have stretched out my hand on you , and will deliver you for a spoil to the nations ; and I will cut you off from the peoples , and I will cause you to perish out of the countries : I will destroy you ; and you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
therefore thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , Be@@ hold , I am against you , Ty@@ re , and will cause many nations to come up against you , as the sea causes its waves to come up .
he shall kill your daughters in the field with the sword ; and he shall make for@@ ts against you , and cast up a m@@ ound against you , and raise up the Buck@@ ler against you .
thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to Ty@@ re : shall not the islands shake at the sound of your fall , when the wounded gro@@ an , when the slaughter is made in the midst of you ?
for thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : when I shall make you a des@@ ol@@ ate city , like the cities that are not inhabited ; when I shall bring up the deep on you , and the great waters shall cover you ;
of fine linen with embroi@@ dered work from Egypt was your sail , that it might be to you for a banner ; blue and purple from the islands of Elis@@ ha@@ h was your aw@@ ning .
the inhabitants of Sid@@ on and Ar@@ v@@ ad were your rowers : your wise men , Ty@@ re , were in you , they were your pilots .
the old men of Ge@@ bal and the wise men of it were in you your re@@ pair@@ ers of ship se@@ ams : all the ships of the sea with their mar@@ in@@ ers were in you to deal in your merchandise .
Persia and Lu@@ d and P@@ ut were in your army , your men of war : they han@@ ged the shield and helmet in you ; they set forth your com@@ eliness .
the men of Ar@@ v@@ ad with your army were on your walls all around , and val@@ orous men were in your towers ; they han@@ ged their shi@@ elds on your walls all around ; they have perf@@ ected your beauty .
by your great wisdom by your traffic you have increased your riches , and your heart is lifted up because of your rich@@ es@@ --
therefore , behold , I will bring strangers on you , the terrible of the nations ; and they shall draw their s@@ words against the beauty of your wisdom , and they shall def@@ ile your brightness .
you were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created , until un@@ righteousness was found in you .
by the abundance of your traffic they filled the midst of you with violence , and you have sin@@ ned : therefore I have cast you as prof@@ ane out of the mountain of God ; and I have destroyed you , covering cher@@ u@@ b , from the midst of the stones of fire .
and say , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , I am against you , Sid@@ on ; and I will be glori@@ fied in the midst of you ; and they shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , when I shall have executed judgments in her , and shall be sancti@@ fied in her .
he and his people with him , the terrible of the nations , shall be brought in to destroy the land ; and they shall draw their s@@ words against Egypt , and fill the land with the sl@@ ain .
thus was it beautiful in its greatness , in the length of its branches ; for its root was by many waters .
thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : I will spread out my net on you with a company of many peoples ; and they shall bring you up in my net .
all the bright lights of the sky will I make dark over you , and set darkness on your land , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
yes , I will make many peoples amazed at you , and their kings shall be horri@@ bly afraid for you , when I shall bran@@ dish my sword before them ; and they shall trem@@ ble at every moment , every man for his own life , in the day of your fall .
Phar@@ aoh shall see them , and shall be comfor@@ ted over all his multitude , even Phar@@ aoh and all his army , sl@@ ain by the sword , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
nevertheless , if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it , and he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t turn from his way ; he shall die in his ini@@ qu@@ ity , but you have delivered your soul .
tell them , As I live , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked ; but that the wicked turn from his way and live : turn , turn from your evil ways ; for why will you die , house of Israel ?
again , when I say to the wicked , You shall surely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is lawful and right ;
when the righteous turns from his righteousness , and commits ini@@ qu@@ ity , he shall even die therein .
when the wicked turns from his w@@ ick@@ edness , and does that which is lawful and right , he shall live thereby .
behold , you are to them as a very lovely song of one who has a pleasant voice , and can play well on an instrument ; for they hear your words , but they don '@@ t do them .
as a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered abroad , so will I seek out my sheep ; and I will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day .
you my sheep , the sheep of my past@@ ure , are men , and I am your God , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
and tell it , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , I am against you , Mount Se@@ ir , and I will stretch out my hand against you , and I will make you a des@@ ol@@ ation and an aston@@ ishment .
I will make you a perpetual des@@ ol@@ ation , and your cities shall not be inhabited ; and you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
you shall know that I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have heard all your insul@@ ts which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel , saying , They are laid des@@ ol@@ ate , they have been given us to dev@@ our .
therefore thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : I have sworn , [ saying ] , Su@@ rely the nations that are around you , they shall bear their shame .
neither will I let you hear any more the shame of the nations , neither shall you bear the repro@@ ach of the peoples any more , neither shall you cause your nation to stum@@ ble any more , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
son of man , when the house of Israel lived in their own land , they de@@ filed it by their way and by their do@@ ings : their way before me was as the un@@ clean@@ ness of a woman in her imp@@ urity .
then you shall remember your evil ways , and your do@@ ings that were not good ; and you shall lo@@ a@@ the yourselves in your own sight for your ini@@ qu@@ ities and for your ab@@ om@@ inations .
I will lay sin@@ ews on you , and will bring up flesh on you , and cover you with skin , and put breath in you , and you shall live ; and you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
and join them for you one to another into one stick , that they may become one in your hand .
and I will turn you around , and put hoo@@ ks into your j@@ aws , and I will bring you forth , with all your army , horses and hor@@ sem@@ en , all of them clo@@ thed in full armor , a great company with Buck@@ ler and shield , all of them handling s@@ words ;
for in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken , Su@@ rely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel ;
and I will strike your bow out of your left hand , and will cause your arrows to fall out of your right hand .
they shall bear their shame , and all their t@@ resp@@ asses by which they have t@@ resp@@ assed against me , when they shall dwell securely in their land , and none shall make them afraid ;
you , son of man , show the house to the house of Israel , that they may be ashamed of their ini@@ qu@@ ities ; and let them measure the pattern .
the altar hear@@ th shall be twelve [ cub@@ its ] long by twelve broad , square in the four sides of it .
you have not performed the duty of my holy things ; but you have set performers of my duty in my sanctuary for yourselves .
because they minist@@ ered to them before their idols , and became a stumbling block of ini@@ qu@@ ity to the house of Israel ; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and they shall bear their ini@@ qu@@ ity .
they shall not come near to me , to execute the office of priest to me , nor to come near to any of my holy things , to the things that are most holy ; but they shall bear their shame , and their ab@@ om@@ inations which they have committed .
they shall enter into my sanctuary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister to me , and they shall keep my instruction .
the ep@@ ha@@ h and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain the tenth part of a Hom@@ er , and the ep@@ ha@@ h the tenth part of a Hom@@ er : its measure shall be after the Hom@@ er .
on that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bull for a sin offering .
but Daniel pur@@ posed in his heart that he would not def@@ ile himself with the king 's d@@ ain@@ ties , nor with the wine which he drank : therefore he requested of the prince of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s that he might not def@@ ile himself .
then Daniel went to his house , and made the thing known to Han@@ ani@@ ah , Mis@@ hael , and Az@@ ari@@ ah , his companions :
then the king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar fell on his face , and worshi@@ ped Daniel , and commanded that they should offer an offering and sweet od@@ ors to him .
Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar answered them , Is it on purpose , Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , M@@ esh@@ ach , and A@@ bed@@ ne@@ go , that you don '@@ t serve my god , nor worship the golden image which I have set up ?
then these men were bound in their pants , their tun@@ ics , and their M@@ ant@@ les , and their [ other ] garments , and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
then Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king was astonished , and rose up in ha@@ ste : he spoke and said to his counsel@@ ors , did@@ n '@@ t we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire ? they answered the king , True , O king .
it has seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has worked toward me .
I , Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar , was at rest in my house , and flourishing in my palace .
thus were the visions of my head on my bed : I saw , and behold , a tree in the midst of the earth ; and its height was great .
I saw in the visions of my head on my bed , and behold , a wat@@ cher and a holy one came down from the sky .
therefore , O king , let my counsel be acceptable to you , and break off your sins by righteousness , and your ini@@ qu@@ ities by showing mercy to the poor ; if there may be a leng@@ th@@ ening of your tranquility .
then the king 's face was changed in him , and his thoughts troubled him ; and the joints of his thi@@ gh@@ s were loos@@ ened , and his knees struck one against another .
then Daniel answered before the king , Let your gifts be to yourself , and give your rewards to another ; nevertheless I will read the writing to the king , and make known to him the interpretation .
you , king , the Most High God gave Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar your father the kingdom , and greatness , and glory , and maj@@ esty :
but when his heart was lifted up , and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly , he was de@@ posed from his kingly throne , and they took his glory from him :
then these men assembled together , and found Daniel making petition and suppl@@ ication before his God .
a stone was brought , and laid on the mouth of the den ; and the king sealed it with his own sig@@ net , and with the sig@@ net of his lords ; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel .
then was the king exceeding glad , and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . so Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no kind of harm was found on him , because he had trusted in his God .
in the first year of Bel@@ sha@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head on his bed : then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters .
as for me , Daniel , my spirit was griev@@ ed in the midst of my body , and the visions of my head troubled me .
I prayed to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h my God , and made confession , and said , Oh , Lord , the great and dreadful God , who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments ,
neither have we listened to your servants the prophets , who spoke in your name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
neither have we obeyed the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God , to walk in his laws , which he set before us by his servants the prophets .
he has confirmed his words , which he spoke against us , and against our judges who judged us , by bringing on us a great evil ; for under the whole sky , such has not been done as has been done to Jerusalem .
now , Lord our God , who has brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and have gotten yourself renow@@ n , as at this day ; we have sin@@ ned , we have done w@@ ick@@ edly .
now therefore , our God , listen to the prayer of your servant , and to his peti@@ tions , and cause your face to shine on your sanctuary that is des@@ ol@@ ate , for the Lord 's sake .
Lord , hear ; Lord , forgive ; Lord , listen and do ; don '@@ t def@@ er , for your own sake , my God , because your city and your people are called by your name .
behold , a hand touched me , which set me on my knees and on the pal@@ ms of my hands .
now I have come to make you understand what shall happen to your people in the latter days ; for the vision is yet for [ many ] days :
then shall he return into his land with great substance ; and his heart [ shall be ] against the holy covenant ; and he shall do [ his pleasure ] , and return to his own land .
he shall stretch forth his hand also on the countries ; and the land of Egypt shall not escape .
he shall plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain ; yet he shall come to his end , and none shall help him .
the children of Jud@@ ah and the children of Israel will be gathered together , and they will appoint themselves one head , and will go up from the land ; for great will be the day of J@@ ez@@ re@@ el .
contend with your mother ! contend , for she is not my wife , neither am I her husband ; and let her put away her prostitution from her face , and her adul@@ ter@@ ies from between her breasts ;
therefore behold , I will hedge up your way with thor@@ ns , and I will build a wall against her , that she can '@@ t find her way .
I will give her vineyards from there , and the valley of Ach@@ or for a door of hope ; and she will respond there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
I will even bet@@ ro@@ th you to me in faith@@ fulness ; and you shall know Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
I said to her , " You shall stay with me many days . you shall not play the pro@@ stitute , and you shall not be with any other man . I will also be so toward you . "
my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge . because you have rejected knowledge , I will also reject you , that you may be no priest to me . because you have forgotten your God 's law , I will also forget your children .
my people consult with their wooden idol , and answer to a stick of wood . indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them astr@@ ay , and they have been un@@ faithful to their God .
the pride of Israel testi@@ fies to his face . therefore Israel and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im will stum@@ ble in their ini@@ qu@@ ity . Jud@@ ah also will stum@@ ble with them .
they will go with their f@@ locks and with their herds to seek Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; but they won '@@ t find him . he has withdrawn himself from them .
" when E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im saw his sickness , and Jud@@ ah his wound , Then E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im went to As@@ sy@@ ria , and sent to king J@@ are@@ b : but he is not able to heal you , neither will he cure you of your wound .
they don '@@ t consider in their hearts that I remember all their w@@ ick@@ edness . now their own deeds have engul@@ fed them . they are before my face .
they make the king glad with their w@@ ick@@ edness , and the princes with their lies .
on the day of our king , the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine . he joined his hand with mo@@ c@@ kers .
for they have prepared their heart like an oven , while they lie in wait . their b@@ aker sle@@ eps all the night . in the morning it burns as a fl@@ aming fire .
the pride of Israel testi@@ fies to his face ; yet they haven '@@ t returned to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God , nor sought him , for all this .
they haven '@@ t cried to me with their heart , but they how@@ l on their beds . they assemble themselves for grain and new wine . they turn away from me .
they return , but not to the Most High . they are like a faulty bow . their princes will fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue . this will be their deri@@ sion in the land of Egypt .
" put the trum@@ pet to your lips ! something like an eagle is over Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's house , because they have broken my covenant , and reb@@ elled against my law .
they cry to me , ' My God , we Israel acknowledge you ! '
they have set up kings , but not by me . they have made princes , and I did@@ n '@@ t approve . of their silver and their gold they have made themselves idols , that they may be cut off .
for they have gone up to As@@ sy@@ ria , like a wild don@@ key wandering alone . E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im has hired lovers for himself .
Israel is a luxur@@ i@@ ant vine that puts forth his fruit . according to the abundance of his fruit he has multiplied his al@@ t@@ ars . as their land has prosper@@ ed , they have ador@@ ned their sacred stones .
sow to yourselves in righteousness , reap according to kindness . break up your f@@ allow ground ; for it is time to seek Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , until he comes and rains righteousness on you .
you have pl@@ owed w@@ ick@@ edness . you have re@@ aped ini@@ qu@@ ity . you have eaten the fruit of lies , for you trusted in your way , in the multitude of your mighty men .
where is your king now , that he may save you in all your cities ? and your judges , of whom you said , ' Gi@@ ve me a king and princes ? '
mour@@ n like a virgin dressed in s@@ ack@@ cloth for the husband of her youth !
yes , the animals of the field pant to you , for the water bro@@ o@@ ks have dried up , And the fire has dev@@ oured the past@@ ures of the wilderness .
they run like mighty men . they climb the wall like warriors . they each march in his line , and they don '@@ t sw@@ erve off course .
gather the people . sancti@@ fy the assembly . assemble the elders . gather the children , and those who nurse from breasts . let the bri@@ deg@@ room go forth from his room , and the bride out of her room .
then Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was jeal@@ ous for his land , And had pity on his people .
I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth : blood , fire , and pillars of smoke .
" so you will know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , your God , dwelling in Z@@ ion , my holy mountain . then Jerusalem will be holy , and no strangers will pass through her any more .
I will clean@@ se their blood , that I have not cleans@@ ed : for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h d@@ wells in Z@@ ion . "
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : " for three trans@@ gres@@ sions of E@@ dom , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because he pursued his brother with the sword , and cast off all pity , and his anger raged continually , and he kept his wrath forever ;
do two walk together , unless they have agreed ?

he sent out his servant at sup@@ per time to tell those who were invited , ' Come , for everything is ready now . '
" if anyone comes to me , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t disregard his own father , mother , wife , children , brothers , and sisters , yes , and his own life also , he can '@@ t be my disciple .
when he has found it , he carries it on his shoulders , rejo@@ icing .
but when he came to himself he said , ' How many hired servants of my father 's have bread enough to spare , and I 'm dying with hunger !
but when this , your son , came , who has dev@@ oured your living with prostitutes , you killed the f@@ atten@@ ed cal@@ f for him . '
he also said to his disciples , " There was a certain rich man who had a manager . an accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his possessions .
I know what I will do , so that when I am removed from management , they may receive me into their houses . '
calling each one of his lord 's debtors to him , he said to the first , ' How much do you owe to my lord ? '
he cried and said , ' Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Laz@@ ar@@ us , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue ! for I am in angu@@ ish in this flame . '
be careful . if your brother sins against you , rebu@@ ke him . if he rep@@ ents , forgive him .
he w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t for a while , but afterward he said to himself , ' Th@@ ough I neither fear God , nor respect man ,
won '@@ t God av@@ enge his chosen ones , who are crying out to him day and night , and yet he exercises patience with them ?
he spoke also this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness , and who desp@@ ised all others .
the Pharis@@ ee stood and prayed to himself like this : ' God , I thank you , that I am not like the rest of men , extor@@ tion@@ ers , un@@ righteous , adul@@ ter@@ ers , or even like this tax collector .
I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other ; for everyone who exal@@ ts himself will be hum@@ bled , but he who hum@@ bles himself will be exalted . "
Z@@ acc@@ ha@@ eus stood and said to the Lord , " Be@@ hold , Lord , half of my goods I give to the poor . if I have wrong@@ fully exac@@ ted anything of anyone , I restore four times as much . "
he called ten servants of his , and gave them ten Min@@ a coins , and told them , ' Conduct business until I come . '
but bring those enemies of mine who did@@ n '@@ t want me to reign over them here , and kill them before me . ' "
some of the Pharis@@ ees from the multitude said to him , " Teacher , rebu@@ ke your disciples ! "
saying , " If you , even you , had known today the things which belong to your peace ! but now , they are hidden from your eyes .
and will d@@ ash you and your children within you to the ground . they will not leave in you one stone on another , because you did@@ n '@@ t know the time of your vis@@ itation . "
" but when the farmers saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , ' This is the heir . come , let 's kill him , that the inheritance may be ours . '
in the hearing of all the people , he said to his disciples ,
he looked up , and saw the rich people who were putting their gifts into the treasury .
" so be careful , or your hearts will be loaded down with car@@ ousing , drun@@ ken@@ ness , and cares of this life , and that day will come on you suddenly .
but I prayed for you , that your faith w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t fail . you , when once you have turned again , establish your brothers . "
then he said to them , " But now , whoever has a pur@@ se , let him take it , and likewise a wallet . whoever has none , let him sell his cloak , and buy a sword .
Her@@ od and Pil@@ ate became friends with each other that very day , for before that they were enemies with each other .
but Jesus , turning to them , said , " Dau@@ ghters of Jerusalem , don '@@ t we@@ ep for me , but we@@ ep for yourselves and for your children .
becoming terrified , they bowed their faces down to the earth . they said to them , " Why do you seek the living among the dead ?
it happened , while they talked and questioned together , that Jesus himself came near , and went with them .
he said to them , " What are you talking about as you walk , and are sad ? "
the next day , he saw Jesus coming to him , and said , " Be@@ hold , the Lam@@ b of God , who takes away the sin of the world !
John testified , saying , " I have seen the Spirit descending like a do@@ ve out of heaven , and it remained on him .
for God did@@ n '@@ t send his Son into the world to judge the world , but that the world should be saved through him .
John answered , " A man can receive nothing , unless it has been given him from heaven .
so the woman left her water pot , and went away into the city , and said to the people ,
the disciples therefore said one to another , " Has anyone brought him something to eat ? "
for an angel went down at certain times into the pool , and stirred up the water . whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had .
immediately , the man was made well , and took up his mat and walked . now it was the Sabbath on that day .
Jesus therefore answered them , " Most certainly , I tell you , the Son can do nothing of himself , but what he sees the Father doing . for whatever things he does , these the Son also does likewise .
I can of myself do nothing . as I hear , I judge , and my judgment is righteous ; because I don '@@ t seek my own will , but the will of my Father who sent me .
but I know you , that you don '@@ t have God 's love in yourselves .
therefore Jesus answered them , " Don '@@ t mur@@ mur among yourselves .
the Jews therefore cont@@ ended with one another , saying , " How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? "
Jesus therefore said to them , " Most certainly I tell you , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood , you don '@@ t have life in yourselves .
but Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples mur@@ mu@@ red at this , said to them , " Does this cause you to stum@@ ble ?
if anyone desires to do his will , he will know about the teaching , whether it is from God , or if I am speaking from myself .
Jesus therefore cried out in the temple , teaching and saying , " You both know me , and know where I am from . I have not come of myself , but he who sent me is true , whom you don '@@ t know .
Jesus therefore said to them , " When you have lifted up the Son of Man , then you will know that I am he , and I do nothing of myself , but as my Father taught me , I say these things .
are you greater than our father , Abraham , who died ? the prophets died . who do you make yourself out to be ? "
Jesus said to them , " If you were blind , you would have no sin ; but now you say , ' We see . ' therefore your sin remains .
I am the good shepherd . the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep .
he who is a hired hand , and not a shepherd , who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t own the sheep , sees the wolf coming , leaves the sheep , and fle@@ es . the wolf s@@ nat@@ ches the sheep , and sc@@ atters them .
I give eternal life to them . they will never perish , and no one will s@@ nat@@ ch them out of my hand .
Jesus therefore , again gro@@ aning in himself , came to the tomb . now it was a cave , and a stone lay against it .
now he said this , not because he cared for the poor , but because he was a thief , and having the money box , used to steal what was put into it .
for you always have the poor with you , but you don '@@ t always have me . "
the Pharis@@ ees therefore said among themselves , " See how you accomplish nothing . behold , the world has gone after him . "
he who loves his life will lose it . he who h@@ ates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life .
he who rejects me , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t receive my say@@ ings , has one who judges him . the word that I spoke , the same will judge him in the last day .
for I spoke not from myself , but the Father who sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
arose from sup@@ per , and laid aside his outer garments . he took a towel , and wrapped a towel around his waist .
by this everyone will know that you are my disciples , if you have love for one another . "
if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and will receive you to myself ; that where I am , you may be there also .
Don '@@ t you believe that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? the words that I tell you , I speak not from myself ; but the Father who lives in me does his works .
if you keep my commandments , you will remain in my love ; even as I have kept my Father 's commandments , and remain in his love .
greater love has no one than this , that someone lay down his life for his friends .
if you were of the world , the world would love its own . but because you are not of the world , since I chose you out of the world , therefore the world h@@ ates you .
now , Father , glori@@ fy me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world existed .
but now I come to you , and I say these things in the world , that they may have my joy made full in themselves .
father , I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am , that they may see my glory , which you have given me , for you loved me before the foundation of the world .
righteous Father , the world h@@ as@@ n '@@ t known you , but I knew you ; and these knew that you sent me .
Jesus answered him , " Do you say this by yourself , or did others tell you about me ? "
therefore when Jesus saw his mother , and the disciple whom he loved standing there , he said to his mother , " Woman , behold your son ! "
then he said to the disciple , " Be@@ hold , your mother ! " from that hour , the disciple took her to his own home .
this is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to his disciples , after he had risen from the dead .
they were all amazed and marv@@ eled , saying to one another , " Be@@ hold , are@@ n '@@ t all these who speak Gal@@ ile@@ ans ?
but Peter , standing up with the eleven , lifted up his voice , and spoke out to them , " You men of Ju@@ dea , and all you who dwell at Jerusalem , let this be known to you , and listen to my words .
I will show wonders in the sky above , and signs on the earth beneath ; blood , and fire , and bil@@ lows of smoke .
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves ,
now , Lord , look at their threats , and grant to your servants to speak your word with all bold@@ ness ,
and laid hands on the apostles , and put them in public custody .
he said to them , " You men of Israel , be careful concerning these men , what you are about to do .
after this man , Jud@@ as of Gal@@ ilee rose up in the days of the enrollment , and drew away some people after him . he also perished , and all , as many as obeyed him , were scattered abroad .
and said to him , ' Get out of your land , and from your relatives , and come into a land which I will show you . '
and delivered him out of all his afflic@@ tions , and gave him favor and wisdom before Phar@@ aoh , king of Egypt . he made him governor over Egypt and all his house .
on the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers , and Joseph 's race was revealed to Phar@@ aoh .
the same took advantage of our race , and mist@@ re@@ ated our fathers , and forced them to throw out their babies , so that they w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t stay alive .
when he was thrown out , Phar@@ aoh 's daughter took him up , and re@@ ared him as her own son .
but when he was forty years old , it came into his heart to visit his brothers , the children of Israel .
but they cried out with a loud voice , and stopped their ears , and rushed at him with one accord .
repent therefore of this , your w@@ ick@@ edness , and ask God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you .
he was returning and sitting in his ch@@ ari@@ ot , and was reading the prophet Isaiah .
now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this , " He was led as a sheep to the slaughter . as a lamb before his she@@ arer is silent , so he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t open his mouth .
the e@@ un@@ uch answered Philip , " Who is the prophet talking about ? about himself , or about someone else ? "
but An@@ ani@@ as answered , " Lord , I have heard from many about this man , how much evil he did to your saints at Jerusalem .
he , fast@@ ening his eyes on him , and being frightened , said , " What is it , Lord ? " he said to him , " Your prayers and your gifts to the ne@@ edy have gone up for a memorial before God .
now while Peter was very perpl@@ exed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean , behold , the men who were sent by Corn@@ eli@@ us , having made inquiry for Simon 's house , stood before the gate ,
on the next day they entered into Caes@@ area . Corn@@ eli@@ us was waiting for them , having called together his relatives and his near friends .
even Jesus of Naz@@ areth , how God ano@@ inted him with the Holy Spirit and with power , who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil , for God was with him .
when Peter had come to himself , he said , " Now I truly know that the Lord has sent out his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Her@@ od , and from everything the Jewish people were expecting . "
they said to her , " You are crazy ! " but she insisted that it was so . they said , " It is his angel . "
Bar@@ nab@@ as and Saul returned to Jerusalem , when they had fulfilled their service , also taking with them John whose surname was Mark .
when they were at Sal@@ am@@ is , they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish syn@@ agogues . they had also John as their attendant .
when he had removed him , he raised up David to be their king , to whom he also testified , ' I have found David the son of Jes@@ se , a man after my heart , who will do all my will . '
yet he did@@ n '@@ t leave himself without witness , in that he did good and gave you rains from the sky and fruitful seasons , filling our hearts with food and gl@@ ad@@ ness . "
that you abst@@ ain from things sacrificed to idols , from blood , from things strang@@ led , and from sexual im@@ morality , from which if you keep yourselves , it will be well with you . farewell . "
but Paul cried with a loud voice , saying , " Don '@@ t harm yourself , for we are all here ! "
he brought them up into his house , and set food before them , and rejo@@ iced greatly , with all his household , having believed in God .
when they opposed him and bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed , he shook out his clothing and said to them , " Your blood be on your own heads ! I am clean . from now on , I will go to the Genti@@ les ! "
Cris@@ pus , the ruler of the synagogue , believed in the Lord with all his house . many of the Corinth@@ ians , when they heard , believed and were baptized .
" now , behold , I know that you all , among whom I went about preaching the Kingdom of God , will see my face no more .
take heed , therefore , to yourselves , and to all the flock , in which the Holy Spirit has made you over@@ se@@ ers , to shepherd the assembly of the Lord and God which he purchased with his own blood .
men will arise from among your own selves , speaking perverse things , to draw away the disciples after them .
when he had spoken these things , he kn@@ elt down and prayed with them all .
some of the disciples from Caes@@ area also went with us , bringing one M@@ nas@@ on of Cyprus , an early disciple , with whom we would stay .
therefore do what we tell you . we have four men who have taken a vo@@ w .
I said , ' Lord , they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue those who believed in you .
A@@ gri@@ pp@@ a said to Paul , " You may speak for yourself . " then Paul stretched out his hand , and made his defense .
" indeed , all the Jews know my way of life from my youth up , which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem ;
when they had withdrawn , they spoke one to another , saying , " This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds . "
when they did@@ n '@@ t agree among themselves , they departed after Paul had spoken one word , " The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah , the prophet , to our fathers ,
requesting , if by any means now at last I may be prosper@@ ed by the will of God to come to you .
likewise also the men , leaving the natural function of the woman , burned in their lust toward one another , men doing what is inappropriate with men , and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error .
or do you desp@@ ise the riches of his goodness , for@@ bear@@ ance , and patience , not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance ?
but according to your hard@@ ness and un@@ repent@@ ant heart you are treas@@ uring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath , revelation , and of the righteous judgment of God ;
and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind , a light to those who are in darkness ,
but I see a different law in my members , war@@ ring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into cap@@ tivity under the law of sin which is in my members .
for what the law cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God did , sending his own Son in the lik@@ eness of sinful flesh and for sin , he condemned sin in the flesh ;
not only so , but ourselves also , who have the first fruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves gro@@ an within ourselves , waiting for adoption , the redemption of our body .
and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy , which he prepared beforehand for glory ,
but what does it say ? " the word is near you , in your mouth , and in your heart " ; that is , the word of faith , which we preach :
Don '@@ t seek revenge yourselves , beloved , but give place to God 's wrath . for it is written , " Ven@@ ge@@ ance belongs to me ; I will repay , says the Lord . "
so then each one of us will give account of himself to God .
do you have faith ? have it to yourself before God . happy is he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t judge himself in that which he approves .
for even Christ did@@ n '@@ t please himself . but , as it is written , " The repro@@ aches of those who repro@@ ached you fell on me . "
now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that you may abound in hope , in the power of the Holy Spirit .
let no one deceive himself . if anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world , let him become a fool , that he may become wise .
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you , or by man 's judgment . yes , I don '@@ t judge my own self .
for I know nothing against myself . yet I am not justified by this , but he who judges me is the Lord .
now these things , brothers , I have in a figure transferred to myself and A@@ pol@@ los for your s@@ akes , that in us you might learn not to think beyond the things which are written , that none of you be pu@@ ffed up against one another .
I don '@@ t write these things to shame you , but to admon@@ ish you as my beloved children .
therefore it is already altogether a defect in you , that you have lawsuits one with another . why not rather be wrong@@ ed ? why not rather be def@@ ra@@ u@@ ded ?
or don '@@ t you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you , which you have from God ? you are not your own ,
( but if she de@@ parts , let her remain un@@ married , or else be reconciled to her husband ) , and that the husband not leave his wife .
for he who eats and drinks in an un@@ worthy way eats and drinks judgment to himself , if he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t discern the Lord 's body .
for if we discer@@ ned ourselves , we w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t be judged .
if they desire to learn anything , let them ask their own husbands at home , for it is shameful for a woman to chat@@ ter in the assembly .
on the first day of the week , let each one of you save , as he may prosper , that no collections be made when I come .
yes , we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves , that we should not trust in ourselves , but in God who raises the dead ,
but I determined this for myself , that I would not come to you again in sorrow .
not that we are sufficient of ourselves , to account anything as from ourselves ; but our sufficiency is from God ;
and not as Moses , who put a veil on his face , that the children of Israel w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t look stead@@ fast@@ ly on the end of that which was passing away .
for if we are beside ourselves , it is for God . or if we are of sober mind , it is for you .
for we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who comm@@ end themselves . but they themselves , measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves with themselves , are without understanding .
test your own selves , whether you are in the faith . test your own selves . or don '@@ t you know as to your own selves , that Jesus Christ is in you ? -@@ -@@ unless indeed you are dis@@ qualified .
then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Bar@@ nab@@ as , taking Tit@@ us also with me .
that which was a temptation to you in my flesh , you did@@ n '@@ t desp@@ ise nor reject ; but you received me as an angel of God , even as Christ Jesus .
I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way . but he who troubles you will bear his judgment , whoever he is .
for the whole law is fulfilled in one word , in this : " you shall love your neighbor as yourself . "
brothers , even if a man is caught in some fault , you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentl@@ eness ; looking to yourself so that you also are@@ n '@@ t tempted .
for if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing , he decei@@ ves himself .
but let each man test his own work , and then he will take pride in himself and not in his neighbor .
in whom also we were assigned an inheritance , having been fore@@ ordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will ;
Don '@@ t cease to give thanks for you , making mention of you in my prayers ,
but God , being rich in mercy , for his great love with which he loved us ,
that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus ;
therefore putting away false@@ hood , speak truth each one with his neighbor . for we are members of one another .
let all bitterness , wrath , anger , out@@ cry , and slan@@ der , be put away from you , with all mal@@ ice .
speaking to one another in p@@ sal@@ ms , hym@@ ns , and spiritual songs ; singing , and making melody in your heart to the Lord ;
servants , be obedient to those who according to the flesh are your masters , with fear and trembling , in sing@@ l@@ eness of your heart , as to Christ ;
doing nothing through rivalry or through conce@@ it , but in humility , each counting others better than himself ;
for they all seek their own , not the things of Jesus Christ .
yes , I beg you also , true yo@@ ke@@ fellow , help these women , for they lab@@ ored with me in the Good News , with Cl@@ ement also , and the rest of my fellow workers , whose names are in the book of life .
forbid@@ ding us to speak to the Genti@@ les that they may be saved ; to fill up their sins always . but wrath has come on them to the utter@@ most .
therefore he who rejects this do@@ es@@ n '@@ t reject man , but God , who has also given his Holy Spirit to you .
and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , even as we instructed you ;
for the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the ar@@ chang@@ el , and with God 's trum@@ pet . the dead in Christ will rise first ,
one who rules his own house well , having children in subj@@ ection with all reverence ;
let servants be husbands of one wife , ruling their children and their own houses well .
pay attention to yourself , and to your teaching . continue in these things , for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you .
but if anyone do@@ es@@ n '@@ t provide for his own , and especially his own household , he has denied the faith , and is worse than an un@@ believer .
let as many as are bond@@ servants under the y@@ oke count their own masters worthy of all honor , that the name of God and the doctrine not be bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed .
charge those who are rich in this present world that they not be ha@@ u@@ ghty , nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches , but on the living God , who rich@@ ly provides us with everything to enjoy ;
having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you ; which lived first in your grandmother Lo@@ is , and your mother E@@ un@@ ice , and , I am persuaded , in you also .
remember Jesus Christ , risen from the dead , of the seed of David , according to my Good News ,
and the Lord will deliver me from every evil work , and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom ; to whom be the glory forever and ever . A@@ men .
in all things showing yourself an example of good works ; in your teaching showing integrity , seriousness , in@@ corrup@@ tibility ,
I thank my God always , making mention of you in my prayers ,
I beg you for my child , whom I have become the father of in my chains , One@@ sim@@ us ,
whom I desired to keep with me , that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News .
of the angels he says , " Who makes his angels winds , and his servants a flame of fire . "
but of the Son he says , " Your throne , O God , is forever and ever . the scep@@ ter of upri@@ ghtness is the scep@@ ter of your Kingdom .
you have loved righteousness , and hated ini@@ qu@@ ity ; therefore God , your God , has ano@@ inted you with the oil of gl@@ ad@@ ness above your fellows . "
and , " You , Lord , in the beginning , laid the foundation of the earth . the heavens are the works of your hands .
as a mantle , you will roll them up , and they will be changed ; but you are the same . your years will not fail . "
for he has said this somewhere about the seventh day , " God rested on the seventh day from all his works " ;
for he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his works , as God did from his .
nobody takes this honor on himself , but he is called by God , just like Aaron was .
here people who die receive ti@@ thes , but there one receives ti@@ thes of whom it is testified that he lives .
they will not teach every man his fellow citizen , and every man his brother , saying , ' Know the Lord , ' for all will know me , from their least to their greatest .
but into the second the high priest alone , once in the year , not without blood , which he offers for himself , and for the errors of the people .
then I said , ' Be@@ hold , I have come ( in the scroll of the book it is written of me ) to do your will , O God . ' "
then he has said , " Be@@ hold , I have come to do your will . " he takes away the first , that he may establish the second ,
by faith , E@@ no@@ ch was taken away , so that he w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t see death , and he was not found , because God translated him . for he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to God .
by faith , Noah , being warned about things not yet seen , moved with go@@ dly fear , prepared a ship for the saving of his house , through which he condemned the world , and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith .
therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore , were fa@@ ther@@ ed by one man , and him as good as dead .
these all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them and embraced them from af@@ ar , and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
accounting the repro@@ ach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt ; for he looked to the reward .
he is a double @@@ -@@ @ minded man , unstable in all his ways .
but be do@@ ers of the word , and not only hear@@ ers , delu@@ ding your own selves .
for if anyone is a he@@ arer of the word and not a do@@ er , he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror ;
for he sees himself , and goes away , and immediately for@@ gets what kind of man he was .
and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing , and say , " S@@ it here in a good place " ; and you tell the poor man , " Stand there , " or " S@@ it by my foot@@ stool " ;
haven '@@ t you shown partiality among yourselves , and become judges with evil thoughts ?
however , if you fulfill the royal law , according to the Scripture , " You shall love your neighbor as yourself , " you do well .
yes , a man will say , " You have faith , and I have works . " show me your faith without works , and I by my works will show you my faith .
you see then that by works , a man is justified , and not only by faith .
he prayed again , and the sky gave rain , and the earth brought forth its fruit .
you also , as living stones , are built up as a spiritual house , to be a holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .
for , " He who would love life , and see good days , let him keep his tongue from evil , and his lips from speaking dece@@ it .
for@@ as@@ much then as Christ suffered for us in the flesh , arm yourselves also with the same mind ; for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin ;
but false prophets also arose among the people , as false teachers will also be among you , who will secretly bring in destructive here@@ sies , denying even the Master who bought them , bringing on themselves swift destruction .
if we say that we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
by this we know love , because he laid down his life for us . and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers .
but whoever has the world 's goods , and sees his brother in need , and closes his heart of compassion against him , how does the love of God remain in him ?
in this is love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us , and sent his Son as the at@@ oning sacrifice for our sins .
this commandment we have from him , that he who loves God should also love his brother .
he who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself . he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t believe God has made him a li@@ ar , because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son .
I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth , even as we have been commanded by the Father .
watch yourselves , that we don '@@ t lose the things which we have accomplished , but that we receive a full reward .
they said to you that " In the last time there will be mo@@ c@@ kers , walking after their own un@@ go@@ dly lu@@ sts . "
this is the Revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave him to show to his servants the things which must happen soon , which he sent and made known by his angel to his servant , John ,
I was in the Spirit on the Lord 's day , and I heard behind me a loud voice , like a trum@@ pet
he had seven stars in his right hand . out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two @@@ -@@ @ ed@@ ged sword . his face was like the sun shining at its brightest .
but I have this against you , that you left your first love .
" I know your works , oppression , and your poverty ( but you are rich ) , and the bl@@ asph@@ emy of those who say they are Jews , and they are not , but are a synagogue of Satan .
" I know your works , your love , faith , service , patient endurance , and that your last works are more than the first .
nevertheless you have a few names in Sar@@ dis that did not def@@ ile their garments . they will walk with me in white , for they are worthy .
I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire , that you may become rich ; and white garments , that you may clo@@ the yourself , and that the shame of your n@@ ak@@ edness may not be revealed ; and eye sal@@ ve to ano@@ int your eyes , that you may see .
immediately I was in the Spirit . behold , there was a throne set in heaven , and one sitting on the throne
around the throne were twenty @@@ -@@ @ four thr@@ ones . on the thr@@ ones were twenty @@@ -@@ @ four elders sitting , dressed in white garments , with crow@@ ns of gold on their heads .
the twenty @@@ -@@ @ four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne , and worship him who lives forever and ever , and throw their crow@@ ns before the throne , saying ,
when he opened the third seal , I heard the third living creature saying , " Come and see ! " and behold , a black horse , and he who sat on it had a balance in his hand .
the stars of the sky fell to the earth , like a fi@@ g tree dropping its un@@ ripe fi@@ gs when it is shaken by a great wind .
the sky was removed like a scroll when it is rolled up . every mountain and island were moved out of their places .
I told him , " My lord , you know . " he said to me , " These are those who came out of the great tribu@@ lation . they washed their robes , and made them white in the Lam@@ b 's blood .
they did@@ n '@@ t repent of their murders , nor of their sorcer@@ ies , nor of their sexual im@@ morality , nor of their the@@ fts .
he had in his hand a little open book . he set his right foot on the sea , and his left on the land .
the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to the sky ,
the seventh angel sounded , and great voices in heaven followed , saying , " The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord , and of his Christ . he will reign forever and ever ! "
the twenty @@@ -@@ @ four elders , who sit on their thr@@ ones before God 's throne , fell on their faces and worshi@@ ped God ,
God 's temple that is in heaven was opened , and the ark of the Lord 's covenant was seen in his temple . Light@@ nings , sounds , th@@ un@@ ders , an earthquake , and great hail followed .
another sign was seen in heaven . behold , a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and on his heads seven crow@@ ns .
the beast which I saw was like a le@@ op@@ ard , and his feet were like those of a bear , and his mouth like the mouth of a lion . the dragon gave him his power , his throne , and great authority .
he opened his mouth for bl@@ asph@@ emy against God , to bl@@ asph@@ eme his name , and his dwelling , those who dwell in heaven .
I heard a sound from heaven , like the sound of many waters , and like the sound of a great thunder . the sound which I heard was like that of har@@ p@@ ists playing on their har@@ ps .
I heard the voice from heaven saying , " Write , ' Bless@@ ed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on . ' " " yes , " says the Spirit , " that they may rest from their lab@@ ors ; for their works follow with them . "
he who sat on the cloud thrust his sick@@ le on the earth , and the earth was re@@ aped .
another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven . he also had a sharp sick@@ le .
the angel thrust his sick@@ le into the earth , and gathered the v@@ intage of the earth , and threw it into the great win@@ ep@@ ress of the wrath of God .
I saw another great and marvelous sign in the sky : seven angels having the seven last pl@@ agues , for in them God 's wrath is finished .
who w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t fear you , Lord , and glori@@ fy your name ? for you only are holy . for all the nations will come and worship before you . for your righteous acts have been revealed . "
the first went , and poured out his bowl into the earth , and it became a harmful and evil sore on the people who had the mark of the beast , and who worshi@@ ped his image .
the second angel poured out his bowl into the sea , and it became blood as of a dead man . every living thing in the sea died .
the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of water , and they became blood .
the fourth poured out his bowl on the sun , and it was given to him to scor@@ ch men with fire .
the fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast , and his kingdom was dark@@ ened . they gn@@ aw@@ ed their tongues because of the pain ,
and they bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed the God of heaven because of their pains and their so@@ res . they did@@ n '@@ t repent of their works .
the sixth poured out his bowl on the great river , the E@@ uph@@ rates . its water was dried up , that the way might be prepared for the kings that come from the sunrise .
" behold , I come like a thief . blessed is he who watches , and keeps his clothes , so that he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t walk naked , and they see his shame . "
the fruits which your soul lu@@ sted after have been lost to you , and all things that were d@@ ain@@ ty and su@@ mp@@ tuous have perished from you , and you will find them no more at all .
after these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven , saying , " H@@ all@@ elu@@ jah ! salvation , power , and glory belong to our God :
the sea gave up the dead who were in it . death and H@@ ades gave up the dead who were in them . they were judged , each one according to his works .
in the middle of its street . on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life , bearing twelve kinds of fruits , yielding its fruit every month . the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made ; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made .
and God blessed the seventh day , and sancti@@ fied it : because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made .
and Adam said , This is now bone of my bones , and flesh of my flesh : she shall be called Woman , because she was taken out of Man .
therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cle@@ ave unto his wife : and they shall be one flesh .
unto the woman he said , I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception ; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children ; and thy desire shall be to thy husband , and he shall rule over thee .
and Adam called his wife 's name Eve ; because she was the mother of all living .
and A@@ bel , he also brought of the fir@@ st@@ lings of his flock and of the fat thereof . and the LORD had respect unto A@@ bel and to his offering :
if thou do@@ est well , shalt thou not be accepted ? and if thou do@@ est not well , sin li@@ eth at the door . and unto thee shall be his desire , and thou shalt rule over him .
and now art thou cur@@ sed from the earth , which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother 's blood from thy hand ;
when thou til@@ lest the ground , it shall not h@@ ence@@ forth yield unto thee her strength ; a fu@@ gi@@ tive and a vag@@ ab@@ ond shalt thou be in the earth .
and Lam@@ ech said unto his wives , Ad@@ ah and Z@@ il@@ lah , He@@ ar my voice ; ye wives of Lam@@ ech , hear@@ ken unto my speech : for I have sl@@ ain a man to my w@@ ounding , and a young man to my hurt .
and Adam lived an hundred and thirty years , and beg@@ at a son in his own lik@@ eness , after his image ; and called his name S@@ eth :
that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair ; and they took them wives of all which they chose .
these are the generations of Noah : Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations , and Noah walked with God .
and God looked upon the earth , and , behold , it was corrupt ; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth .
and God said unto Noah , The end of all flesh is come before me ; for the earth is filled with violence through them ; and , behold , I will destroy them with the earth .
and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten , and thou shalt gather it to thee ; and it shall be for food for thee , and for them .
all in whose no@@ str@@ ils was the breath of life , of all that was in the dry land , died .
also he sent forth a do@@ ve from him , to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground ;
but the do@@ ve found no rest for the sole of her foot , and she returned unto him into the ark , for the waters were on the face of the whole earth : then he put forth his hand , and took her , and pulled her in unto him into the ark .
bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee , of all flesh , both of f@@ owl , and of cattle , and of every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the earth ; that they may breed ab@@ und@@ antly in the earth , and be fruitful , and multiply upon the earth .
every beast , every cre@@ eping thing , and every f@@ owl , and whatsoever cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the earth , after their kinds , went forth out of the ark .
and the LORD sm@@ elled a sweet sav@@ our ; and the LORD said in his heart , I will not again curse the ground any more for man 's sake ; for the imagination of man 's heart is evil from his youth ; neither will I again sm@@ ite any more every thing living , as I have done .
and he drank of the wine , and was drun@@ ken ; and he was uncovered within his tent .
and She@@ m and Jap@@ h@@ eth took a garment , and laid it upon both their shoulders , and went backward , and covered the n@@ ak@@ edness of their father ; and their faces were backward , and they saw not their father 's n@@ ak@@ edness .
and he said , Cur@@ sed be Can@@ a@@ an ; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren .
by these were the is@@ les of the Genti@@ les divided in their lands ; every one after his tongue , after their families , in their nations .
now the LORD had said unto Ab@@ ram , Get thee out of thy country , and from thy kind@@ red , and from thy father 's house , unto a land that I will sh@@ ew thee :
and it came to pass , when he was come near to enter into Egypt , that he said unto Sar@@ ai his wife , Be@@ hold now , I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon :
why s@@ ai@@ d@@ st thou , She is my sister ? so I might have taken her to me to wife : now therefore behold thy wife , take her , and go thy way .
and he went on his journeys from the south even to Be@@ the@@ l , unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning , between Be@@ the@@ l and H@@ ai ;
and blessed be the most high God , which hath delivered th@@ ine enemies into thy hand . and he gave him ti@@ thes of all .
and the king of So@@ dom said unto Ab@@ ram , Gi@@ ve me the persons , and take the goods to thy@@ self .
and Ab@@ ram said , Lord GO@@ D , what wil@@ t thou give me , seeing I go chil@@ dless , and the ste@@ ward of my house is this Eli@@ ez@@ er of Damascus ?
and , behold , the word of the LORD came unto him , saying , This shall not be th@@ ine heir ; but he that shall come forth out of th@@ ine own bow@@ els shall be th@@ ine heir .
and he said unto Ab@@ ram , Know of a su@@ rety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs , and shall serve them ; and they shall aff@@ l@@ ict them four hundred years ;
and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace ; thou shalt be buried in a good old age .
and he said , Hag@@ ar , Sar@@ ai 's maid , wh@@ ence cam@@ est thou ? and whi@@ ther wil@@ t thou go ? and she said , I flee from the face of my mistress Sar@@ ai .
and Hag@@ ar bare Ab@@ ram a son : and Ab@@ ram called his son 's name , which Hag@@ ar bare , I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el .
and Ab@@ ram fell on his face : and God talked with him , saying ,
and I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant , to be a God unto thee , and to thy seed after thee .
and I will give unto thee , and to thy seed after thee , the land where@@ in thou art a stranger , all the land of Can@@ a@@ an , for an everlasting possession ; and I will be their God .
then Abraham fell upon his face , and laughed , and said in his heart , Sh@@ all a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old ? and shall Sarah , that is ninety years old , bear ?
and Abraham took I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el his son , and all that were born in his house , and all that were bought with his money , every male among the men of Abraham 's house ; and circum@@ c@@ ised the flesh of their fores@@ kin in the self@@ same day , as God had said unto him .
and L@@ ot went out at the door unto them , and shut the door after him ,
and it came to pass , when they had brought them forth abroad , that he said , Es@@ cape for thy life ; look not behind thee , neither stay thou in all the plain ; escape to the mountain , lest thou be consumed .
therefore Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h rose early in the morning , and called all his servants , and told all these things in their ears : and the men were sore afraid .
then Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h called Abraham , and said unto him , What hast thou done unto us ? and what have I offended thee , that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin ? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done .
and unto Sarah he said , Be@@ hold , I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver : behold , he is to thee a covering of the eyes , unto all that are with thee , and with all other : thus she was re@@ proved .
and Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him , whom Sarah bare to him , Isaac .
and Abraham circum@@ c@@ ised his son Isaac being eight days old , as God had commanded him .
and Abraham rose up early in the morning , and sadd@@ led his ass , and took two of his young men with him , and Isaac his son , and cl@@ ave the wood for the burnt offering , and rose up , and went unto the place of which God had told him .
and Abraham said unto his young men , A@@ bi@@ de ye here with the ass ; and I and the l@@ ad will go y@@ on@@ der and worship , and come again to you ,
and he said , L@@ ay not th@@ ine hand upon the l@@ ad , neither do thou any thing unto him : for now I know that thou fe@@ arest God , seeing thou hast not with@@ held thy son , th@@ ine only son from me .
and Abraham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold behind him a ram caught in a th@@ icket by his horns : and Abraham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son .
and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed ; because thou hast obeyed my voice .
I am a stranger and a so@@ jour@@ ner with you : give me a possession of a bur@@ y@@ ing@@ place with you , that I may bury my dead out of my sight .
my lord , hear@@ ken unto me : the land is worth four hundred she@@ k@@ els of silver ; what is that bet@@ wi@@ x@@ t me and thee ? bury therefore thy dead .
and Abraham said unto his el@@ dest servant of his house , that ruled over all that he had , P@@ ut , I pray thee , thy hand under my thi@@ gh :
and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee , then thou shalt be clear from this my oath : only bring not my son thi@@ ther again .
and the servant put his hand under the thi@@ gh of Abraham his master , and sw@@ are to him concerning that matter .
and the servant took ten cam@@ els of the cam@@ els of his master , and departed ; for all the goods of his master were in his hand : and he arose , and went to Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , unto the city of N@@ ah@@ or .
and she said , Dr@@ ink , my lord : and she ha@@ sted , and let down her p@@ itch@@ er upon her hand , and gave him drink .
and when she had done giving him drink , she said , I will draw water for thy cam@@ els also , until they have done drinking .
and she ha@@ sted , and emp@@ tied her p@@ itch@@ er into the tr@@ ough , and ran again unto the well to draw water , and drew for all his cam@@ els .
and she made ha@@ ste , and let down her p@@ itch@@ er from her shoulder , and said , Dr@@ ink , and I will give thy cam@@ els drink also : so I drank , and she made the cam@@ els drink also .
and they blessed Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah , and said unto her , Th@@ ou art our sister , be thou the mother of thousands of millions , and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them .
and the LORD appeared unto him the same night , and said , I am the God of Abraham thy father : fear not , for I am with thee , and will bless thee , and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham 's sake .
and he buil@@ ded an altar there , and called upon the name of the LORD and pit@@ ched his tent there : and there Isaac 's servants di@@ gged a well .
and Isaac said unto them , W@@ herefore come ye to me , seeing ye hate me , and have sent me away from you ?
that thou wil@@ t do us no hurt , as we have not touched thee , and as we have done unto thee nothing but good , and have sent thee away in peace : thou art now the blessed of the LORD .
and Es@@ au was forty years old when he took to wife Jud@@ ith the daughter of Be@@ eri the Hit@@ tite , and Bash@@ em@@ ath the daughter of El@@ on the Hit@@ tite :
and he said , Be@@ hold now , I am old , I know not the day of my death :
now therefore , my son , obey my voice according to that which I command thee .
and thou shalt bring it to thy father , that he may eat , and that he may bless thee before his death .
my father per@@ adventure will feel me , and I shall seem to him as a decei@@ ver ; and I shall bring a curse upon me , and not a blessing .
and she gave the sav@@ our@@ y meat and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son Jacob .
and he came unto his father , and said , My father : and he said , Here am I ; who art thou , my son ?
and Isaac said unto his son , How is it that thou hast found it so quickly , my son ? and he said , Because the LORD thy God brought it to me .
and it came to pass , as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob , and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Es@@ au his brother came in from his hunting .
and he also had made sav@@ our@@ y meat , and brought it unto his father , and said unto his father , Let my father arise , and eat of his son 's ven@@ ison , that thy soul may bless me .
and when Es@@ au heard the words of his father , he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry , and said unto his father , B@@ less me , even me also , O my father .
and Isaac answered and said unto Es@@ au , Be@@ hold , I have made him thy lord , and all his brethren have I given to him for servants ; and with corn and wine have I sustained him : and what shall I do now unto thee , my son ?
and Es@@ au said unto his father , H@@ ast thou but one blessing , my father ? bless me , even me also , O my father . and Es@@ au lifted up his voice , and we@@ pt .
and Es@@ au hated Jacob because of the blessing where@@ with his father blessed him : and Es@@ au said in his heart , The days of mourning for my father are at hand ; then will I sl@@ ay my brother Jacob .
now therefore , my son , obey my voice ; and arise , flee thou to Lab@@ an my brother to Har@@ an ;
and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother , and was gone to Pad@@ an @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am ;
then went Es@@ au unto I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , and took unto the wives which he had Ma@@ hal@@ ath the daughter of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el Abraham 's son , the sister of Ne@@ ba@@ jo@@ th , to be his wife .
and Jacob aw@@ aked out of his sleep , and he said , Su@@ rely the LORD is in this place ; and I knew it not .
and Jacob kis@@ sed Rach@@ el , and lifted up his voice , and we@@ pt .
and Jacob told Rach@@ el that he was her father 's brother , and that he was Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah 's son : and she ran and told her father .
and Jacob did so , and fulfilled her week : and he gave him Rach@@ el his daughter to wife also .
and Le@@ ah said , Happy am I , for the daughters will call me blessed : and she called his name Ash@@ er .
give me my wives and my children , for whom I have served thee , and let me go : for thou know@@ est my service which I have done thee .
and he said , What shall I give thee ? and Jacob said , Th@@ ou shalt not give me any thing : if thou wil@@ t do this thing for me , I will again feed and keep thy flock :
and he removed that day the he goats that were ring@@ str@@ aked and spotted , and all the she goats that were spec@@ k@@ led and spotted , and every one that had some white in it , and all the brown among the sheep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
and he set three days ' journey bet@@ wi@@ x@@ t himself and Jacob : and Jacob fed the rest of Lab@@ an 's f@@ locks .
and Jacob sent and called Rach@@ el and Le@@ ah to the field unto his flock ,
then Jacob rose up , and set his sons and his wives upon cam@@ els ;
and he carried away all his cattle , and all his goods which he had gotten , the cattle of his getting , which he had gotten in Pad@@ an @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am , for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
and Lab@@ an went to she@@ ar his sheep : and Rach@@ el had stolen the images that were her father 's .
and he took his brethren with him , and pursued after him seven days ' journey ; and they over@@ took him in the mount Gil@@ e@@ ad .
and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters ? thou hast now done fool@@ ishly in so doing .
and now , though thou w@@ oul@@ dest needs be gone , because thou sore long@@ ed@@ st after thy father 's house , yet where@@ fore hast thou stolen my gods ?
with wh@@ om@@ soever thou fin@@ dest thy gods , let him not live : before our brethren discern thou what is th@@ ine with me , and take it to thee . for Jacob knew not that Rach@@ el had stolen them .
whereas thou hast searched all my stuff , what hast thou found of all thy household stuff ? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren , that they may judge bet@@ wi@@ x@@ t us both .
that which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee ; I bare the loss of it ; of my hand did@@ st thou require it , whether stolen by day , or stolen by night .
and Jacob said unto his brethren , G@@ ather stones ; and they took stones , and made an heap : and they did eat there upon the heap .
if thou shalt aff@@ l@@ ict my daughters , or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters , no man is with us ; see , God is witness bet@@ wi@@ x@@ t me and thee .
then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount , and called his brethren to eat bread : and they did eat bread , and tar@@ ried all night in the mount .
and early in the morning Lab@@ an rose up , and kis@@ sed his sons and his daughters , and blessed them : and Lab@@ an departed , and returned unto his place .
and Jacob went on his way , and the angels of God met him .
and I have ox@@ en , and asses , f@@ locks , and men@@ servants , and w@@ omen@@ servants : and I have sent to tell my lord , that I may find grace in thy sight .
and he lodged there that same night ; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Es@@ au his brother ;
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants , every drove by themselves ; and said unto his servants , Pass over before me , and put a space bet@@ wi@@ x@@ t drove and drove .
and he rose up that night , and took his two wives , and his two w@@ omen@@ servants , and his eleven sons , and passed over the ford Jab@@ bo@@ k .
and Es@@ au said , I have enough , my brother ; keep that thou hast unto thy@@ self .
and Jacob said , N@@ ay , I pray thee , if now I have found grace in thy sight , then receive my present at my hand : for therefore I have seen thy face , as though I had seen the face of God , and thou w@@ ast pleased with me .
these men are peace@@ able with us ; therefore let them dwell in the land , and trade therein ; for the land , behold , it is large enough for them ; let us take their daughters to us for wives , and let us give them our daughters .
and let us arise , and go up to Be@@ the@@ l ; and I will make there an altar unto God , who answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the way which I went .
and God said unto him , I am God Almighty : be fruitful and multiply ; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee , and kings shall come out of thy lo@@ ins ;
and Israel jour@@ ne@@ yed , and spread his tent beyond the tower of Ed@@ ar .
now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children , because he was the son of his old age : and he made him a coat of many colours .
and he dreamed yet another dream , and told it his brethren , and said , Be@@ hold , I have dreamed a dream more ; and , behold , the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obe@@ is@@ ance to me .
and he told it to his father , and to his brethren : and his father rebu@@ ked him , and said unto him , What is this dream that thou hast dreamed ? shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth ?
and his brethren went to feed their father 's flock in Sh@@ ec@@ hem .
and Jacob rent his clothes , and put s@@ ack@@ cloth upon his lo@@ ins , and mour@@ ned for his son many days .
and On@@ an knew that the seed should not be his ; and it came to pass , when he went in unto his brother 's wife , that he spilled it on the ground , lest that he should give seed to his brother .
and she arose , and went away , and laid by her V@@ ail from her , and put on the garments of her wi@@ do@@ wh@@ ood .
and the LORD was with Joseph , and he was a prosperous man ; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian .
and it came to pass from the time that he had made him over@@ se@@ er in his house , and over all that he had , that the LORD blessed the Egyptian 's house for Joseph 's sake ; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house , and in the field .
there is none greater in this house than I ; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee , because thou art his wife : how then can I do this great w@@ ick@@ edness , and sin against God ?
and she caught him by his garment , saying , Li@@ e with me : and he left his garment in her hand , and fled , and got him out .
and it came to pass , when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand , and was fled forth ,
that she called unto the men of her house , and sp@@ ake unto them , saying , See , he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mo@@ ck us ; he came in unto me to lie with me , and I cried with a loud voice :
and she laid up his garment by her , until his lord came home .
and it came to pass , as I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled out .
and the chief but@@ ler told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , In my dream , behold , a vine was before me ;
yet within three days shall Phar@@ aoh lift up thy head from off thee , and shall hang thee on a tree ; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee .
and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled ; and he sent and called for all the mag@@ icians of Egypt , and all the wise men thereof : and Phar@@ aoh told them his dream ; but there was none that could interpret them unto Phar@@ aoh .
then Phar@@ aoh sent and called Joseph , and they brought him hastily out of the dun@@ geon : and he sha@@ ved himself , and changed his ra@@ iment , and came in unto Phar@@ aoh .
and Phar@@ aoh said unto his servants , Can we find such a one as this is , a man in whom the Spirit of God is ?
and Phar@@ aoh took off his ring from his hand , and put it upon Joseph 's hand , and ar@@ ra@@ yed him in vest@@ ures of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck ;
and Phar@@ aoh said unto Joseph , I am Phar@@ aoh , and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt .
now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt , Jacob said unto his sons , Why do ye look one upon another ?
and Joseph knew his brethren , but they knew not him .
and they lad@@ ed their asses with the corn , and departed th@@ ence .
and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass pro@@ ven@@ der in the inn , he es@@ pied his money ; for , behold , it was in his sack 's mouth .
and it came to pass as they emp@@ tied their s@@ acks , that , behold , every man 's bundle of money was in his sack : and when both they and their father saw the bun@@ dles of money , they were afraid .
and Re@@ ub@@ en sp@@ ake unto his father , saying , S@@ lay my two sons , if I bring him not to thee : deliver him into my hand , and I will bring him to thee again .
and he lifted up his eyes , and saw his brother Benjamin , his mother 's son , and said , Is this your younger brother , of whom ye sp@@ ake unto me ? and he said , God be gr@@ acious unto thee , my son .
and he washed his face , and went out , and ref@@ rained himself , and said , Set on bread .
then they rent their clothes , and lad@@ ed every man his ass , and returned to the city .
my lord asked his servants , saying , Have ye a father , or a brother ?
and thou s@@ ai@@ d@@ st unto thy servants , Exc@@ ept your youngest brother come down with you , ye shall see my face no more .
now therefore , I pray thee , let thy servant abide instead of the l@@ ad a bond@@ man to my lord ; and let the l@@ ad go up with his brethren .
then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him ; and he cried , C@@ ause every man to go out from me . and there stood no man with him , while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , I am Joseph ; do@@ th my father yet live ? and his brethren could not answer him ; for they were troubled at his presence .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , Come near to me , I pray you . and they came near . and he said , I am Joseph your brother , whom ye sold into Egypt .
and thou shalt dwell in the land of Gos@@ hen , and thou shalt be near unto me , thou , and thy children , and thy children 's children , and thy f@@ locks , and thy herds , and all that thou hast :
moreover he kis@@ sed all his brethren , and we@@ pt upon them : and after that his brethren talked with him .
and Phar@@ aoh said unto Joseph , S@@ ay unto thy brethren , This do ye ; L@@ ade your beasts , and go , get you unto the land of Can@@ a@@ an ;
and to his father he sent after this manner ; ten asses lad@@ en with the good things of Egypt , and ten she asses lad@@ en with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way .
and they went up out of Egypt , and came into the land of Can@@ a@@ an unto Jacob their father ,
and he said , I am God , the God of thy father : fear not to go down into Egypt ; for I will there make of thee a great nation :
and Jacob rose up from Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba : and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father , and their little ones , and their wives , in the w@@ agons which Phar@@ aoh had sent to carry him .
and they took their cattle , and their goods , which they had gotten in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and came into Egypt , Jacob , and all his seed with him :
his sons , and his sons ' sons with him , his daughters , and his sons ' daughters , and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt .
and Joseph made ready his ch@@ ari@@ ot , and went up to meet Israel his father , to Gos@@ hen , and presented himself unto him ; and he fell on his neck , and we@@ pt on his neck a good while .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , and unto his father 's house , I will go up , and sh@@ ew Phar@@ aoh , and say unto him , My brethren , and my father 's house , which were in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , are come unto me ;
then Joseph came and told Phar@@ aoh , and said , My father and my brethren , and their f@@ locks , and their herds , and all that they have , are come out of the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; and , behold , they are in the land of Gos@@ hen .
and Joseph placed his father and his brethren , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Ram@@ eses , as Phar@@ aoh had commanded .
and Joseph nourished his father , and his brethren , and all his father 's household , with bread , according to their families .
and they brought their cattle unto Joseph : and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses , and for the f@@ locks , and for the cattle of the herds , and for the asses : and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year .
but I will lie with my fathers , and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt , and bury me in their bur@@ y@@ ing@@ place . and he said , I will do as thou hast said .
and it came to pass after these things , that one told Joseph , Be@@ hold , thy father is sick : and he took with him his two sons , Man@@ as@@ se@@ h and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
and one told Jacob , and said , Be@@ hold , thy son Joseph com@@ eth unto thee : and Israel strengthened himself , and sat upon the bed .
and said unto me , Be@@ hold , I will make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , and I will make of thee a multitude of people ; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession .
and thy issue , which thou beg@@ et@@ test after them , shall be th@@ ine , and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance .
and Israel said unto Joseph , I had not thought to see thy face : and , lo , God hath sh@@ ew@@ ed me also thy seed .
and Joseph brought them out from between his knees , and he bowed himself with his face to the earth .
and when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , it dis@@ pleased him : and he held up his father 's hand , to remove it from E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im 's head unto Man@@ as@@ se@@ h 's head .
and Jacob called unto his sons , and said , G@@ ather yourselves together , that I may tell you that which shall be@@ fall you in the last days .
Re@@ ub@@ en , thou art my fir@@ st@@ born , my might , and the beginning of my strength , the excell@@ ency of dignity , and the excell@@ ency of power :
binding his fo@@ al unto the vine , and his ass 's col@@ t unto the choice vine ; he washed his garments in wine , and his clothes in the blood of grapes :
and he saw that rest was good , and the land that it was pleasant ; and bowed his shoulder to bear , and became a servant unto tribute .
and he charged them , and said unto them , I am to be gathered unto my people : bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of E@@ ph@@ ron the Hit@@ tite ,
and when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the ghost , and was gathered unto his people .
and all the house of Joseph , and his brethren , and his father 's house : only their little ones , and their f@@ locks , and their herds , they left in the land of Gos@@ hen .
and they came to the thresh@@ ing@@ floor of At@@ ad , which is beyond Jordan , and there they mour@@ ned with a great and very sore lam@@ entation : and he made a mourning for his father seven days .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , I die : and God will surely visit you , and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sw@@ are to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob .
now these are the names of the children of Israel , which came into Egypt ; every man and his household came with Jacob .
and when they came to Re@@ u@@ el their father , he said , How is it that ye are come so soon to day ?
and he said unto his daughters , And where is he ? why is it that ye have left the man ? call him , that he may eat bread .
moreover he said , I am the God of thy father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . and Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look upon God .
but every woman shall borrow of her neighbour , and of her that so@@ jour@@ neth in her house , jew@@ els of silver , and jew@@ els of gold , and ra@@ iment : and ye shall put them upon your sons , and upon your daughters ; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians .
and the LORD said unto Moses , P@@ ut forth th@@ ine hand , and take it by the tail . and he put forth his hand , and caught it , and it became a rod in his hand :
and the LORD said furthermore unto him , P@@ ut now th@@ ine hand into thy bos@@ om . and he put his hand into his bos@@ om : and when he took it out , behold , his hand was le@@ pr@@ ous as snow .
and he said , P@@ ut th@@ ine hand into thy bos@@ om again . and he put his hand into his bos@@ om again ; and pl@@ ucked it out of his bos@@ om , and , behold , it was turned again as his other flesh .
and Moses said unto the LORD , O my Lord , I am not eloqu@@ ent , neither her@@ et@@ o@@ fore , nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant : but I am slow of speech , and of a slow tongue .
and the anger of the LORD was kind@@ led against Moses , and he said , Is not Aaron the Lev@@ ite thy brother ? I know that he can speak well . and also , behold , he com@@ eth forth to meet thee : and when he se@@ eth thee , he will be glad in his heart .
and thou shalt take this rod in th@@ ine hand , where@@ with thou shalt do signs .
and the LORD said unto Moses in Mi@@ dian , Go , return into Egypt : for all the men are dead which sought thy life .
and Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them upon an ass , and he returned to the land of Egypt : and Moses took the rod of God in his hand .
and the t@@ ask@@ masters ha@@ sted them , saying , fulfil your works , your daily tasks , as when there was straw .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God : and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God , which br@@ ing@@ eth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
and Am@@ ram took him Jo@@ che@@ bed his father 's sister to wife ; and she bare him Aaron and Moses : and the years of the life of Am@@ ram were an hundred and thirty and seven years .
get thee unto Phar@@ aoh in the morning ; lo , he go@@ eth out unto the water ; and thou shalt stand by the river 's brink against he come ; and the rod which was turned to a ser@@ pent shalt thou take in th@@ ine hand .
and the mag@@ icians of Egypt did so with their enchan@@ tments : and Phar@@ aoh 's heart was hardened , neither did he hear@@ ken unto them ; as the LORD had said .
and the mag@@ icians did so with their enchan@@ tments , and brought up fro@@ gs upon the land of Egypt .
and the fro@@ gs shall depart from thee , and from thy houses , and from thy servants , and from thy people ; they shall remain in the river only .
and they did so ; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod , and smo@@ te the dust of the earth , and it became l@@ ice in man , and in beast ; all the dust of the land became l@@ ice throughout all the land of Egypt .
else , if thou wil@@ t not let my people go , behold , I will send s@@ war@@ ms of flies upon thee , and upon thy servants , and upon thy people , and into thy houses : and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of s@@ war@@ ms of flies , and also the ground where@@ on they are .
and Moses said , Be@@ hold , I go out from thee , and I will int@@ re@@ at the LORD that the s@@ war@@ ms of flies may depart from Phar@@ aoh , from his servants , and from his people , to mor@@ row : but let not Phar@@ aoh deal dece@@ it@@ fully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD .
for now I will stretch out my hand , that I may sm@@ ite thee and thy people with pesti@@ l@@ ence ; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth .
send therefore now , and gather thy cattle , and all that thou hast in the field ; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field , and shall not be brought home , the hail shall come down upon them , and they shall die .
he that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Phar@@ aoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses :
and he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field .
and Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven : and the LORD sent thunder and hail , and the fire ran along upon the ground ; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt .
and Moses went out of the city from Phar@@ aoh , and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD : and the th@@ un@@ ders and hail ceased , and the rain was not poured upon the earth .
and Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt , and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day , and all that night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the lo@@ cu@@ sts .
and Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven ; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days :
they saw not one another , neither rose any from his place for three days : but all the children of Israel had light in their dwell@@ ings .
and all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt shall die , from the fir@@ st@@ born of Phar@@ aoh that sit@@ t@@ eth upon his throne , even unto the fir@@ st@@ born of the mai@@ d@@ servant that is behind the mill ; and all the fir@@ st@@ born of beasts .
but against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue , against man or beast : that ye may know how that the LORD do@@ th put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel .
and Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Phar@@ aoh : and the LORD hardened Phar@@ aoh 's heart , so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land .
and ye shall take a bunch of h@@ ys@@ so@@ p , and dip it in the blood that is in the bas@@ on , and strike the lin@@ tel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bas@@ on ; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning .
and ye shall observe this thing for an ordin@@ ance to thee and to thy sons for ever .
and the people took their d@@ ough before it was leav@@ ened , their kne@@ ad@@ ing@@ tr@@ ough@@ s being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders .
un@@ leav@@ ened bread shall be eaten seven days ; and there shall no leav@@ ened bread be seen with thee , neither shall there be leav@@ en seen with thee in all thy quarters .
and it shall be for a token upon th@@ ine hand , and for front@@ lets between th@@ ine eyes : for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt .
and he made ready his ch@@ ari@@ ot , and took his people with him :
but lift thou up thy rod , and stretch out th@@ ine hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea .
and Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyptians fled against it ; and the LORD over@@ threw the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
and in the greatness of th@@ ine excell@@ ency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee : thou sent@@ est forth thy wrath , which consumed them as stub@@ ble .
thou stret@@ ch@@ ed@@ st out thy right hand , the earth swallowed them .
thou shalt bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of th@@ ine inheritance , in the place , O LORD , which thou hast made for thee to dwell in , in the Sanc@@ tuary , O Lord , which thy hands have established .
see , for that the LORD hath given you the sab@@ bath , therefore he gi@@ v@@ eth you on the sixth day the bread of two days ; abide ye every man in his place , let no man go out of his place on the seventh day .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Go on before the people , and take with thee of the elders of Israel ; and thy rod , where@@ with thou smo@@ test the river , take in th@@ ine hand , and go .
and Je@@ thr@@ o , Moses ' father in law , came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness , where he enc@@ amped at the mount of God :
and Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Phar@@ aoh and to the Egyptians for Israel 's sake , and all the trav@@ ail that had come upon them by the way , and how the LORD delivered them .
and Moses said unto his father in law , Because the people come unto me to inqu@@ ire of God :
thou wil@@ t surely wear away , both thou , and this people that is with thee : for this thing is too heavy for thee ; thou art not able to perform it thy@@ self alone .
and Moses let his father in law depart ; and he went his way into his own land .
and Moses went down from the mount unto the people , and sancti@@ fied the people ; and they washed their clothes .
honour thy father and thy mother : that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee .
ye shall not make with me gods of silver , neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold .
and if he have bet@@ ro@@ thed her unto his son , he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters .
and if a man lie not in wait , but God deliver him into his hand ; then I will appoint thee a place whi@@ ther he shall flee .
and if a man sm@@ ite his servant , or his maid , with a rod , and he die under his hand ; he shall be surely punished .
and if a man sm@@ ite the eye of his servant , or the eye of his maid , that it perish ; he shall let him go free for his eye 's sake .
if the thief be not found , then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges , to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour 's goods .
then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both , that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour 's goods ; and the owner of it shall accept thereof , and he shall not make it good .
and if a man enti@@ ce a maid that is not bet@@ ro@@ thed , and lie with her , he shall surely en@@ dow her to be his wife .
thou shalt not rev@@ ile the gods , nor curse the ruler of thy people .
thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits , and of thy liqu@@ ors : the fir@@ st@@ born of thy sons shalt thou give unto me .
thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leav@@ ened bread ; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning .
beware of him , and obey his voice , provoke him not ; for he will not pardon your trans@@ gres@@ sions : for my name is in him .
but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice , and do all that I speak ; then I will be an enemy unto th@@ ine enemies , and an adversary unto th@@ ine adversaries .
I will send my fear before thee , and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come , and I will make all th@@ ine enemies turn their backs unto thee .
and take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother , and his sons with him , from among the children of Israel , that he may minister unto me in the priest 's office , even Aaron , Nad@@ ab and A@@ bi@@ hu , Ele@@ az@@ ar and I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , Aaron 's sons .
and the curious gir@@ dle of the ep@@ ho@@ d , which is upon it , shall be of the same , according to the work thereof ; even of gold , of blue , and purple , and scar@@ let , and fine tw@@ ined linen .
and thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the ep@@ ho@@ d for stones of memorial unto the children of Israel : and Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD upon his two shoulders for a memorial .
and thou shalt make the breast@@ plate of judgment with cunning work ; after the work of the ep@@ ho@@ d thou shalt make it ; of gold , of blue , and of purple , and of scar@@ let , and of fine tw@@ ined linen , shalt thou make it .
and Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breast@@ plate of judgment upon his heart , when he go@@ eth in unto the holy place , for a memorial before the LORD continually .
thou shalt also take one ram ; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram .
and thou shalt take the other ram ; and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram .
for Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet there@@ at :
so they shall wash their hands and their feet , that they die not : and it shall be a statute for ever to them , even to him and to his seed throughout their generations .
W@@ herefore the children of Israel shall keep the sab@@ bath , to observe the sab@@ bath throughout their generations , for a perpetual covenant .
and all the people brake off the golden ear@@ rings which were in their ears , and brought them unto Aaron .
for Moses had said , consec@@ rate yourselves to day to the LORD , even every man upon his son , and upon his brother ; that he may best@@ ow upon you a blessing this day .
therefore now go , lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee : behold , mine Angel shall go before thee : nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them .
and when the people heard these evil ti@@ dings , they mour@@ ned : and no man did put on him his ornam@@ ents .
and the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornam@@ ents by the mount H@@ ore@@ b .
lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land , and they go a wh@@ oring after their gods , and do sacrifice unto their gods , and one call thee , and thou eat of his sacrifice ;
and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons , and their daughters go a wh@@ oring after their gods , and make thy sons go a wh@@ oring after their gods .
for I will cast out the nations before thee , and enlarge thy borders : neither shall any man desire thy land , when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thr@@ ice in the year .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Write thou these words : for after the ten@@ or of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel .
and of the blue , and purple , and scar@@ let , they made clo@@ ths of service , to do service in the holy place , and made the holy garments for Aaron ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
and he made the breast@@ plate of cunning work , like the work of the ep@@ ho@@ d ; of gold , blue , and purple , and scar@@ let , and fine tw@@ ined linen .
and Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet there@@ at :
and when the cloud was taken up from over the tab@@ ern@@ acle , the children of Israel went on@@ ward in all their journeys :
and he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering ; and it shall be accepted for him to make at@@ onement for him .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation : and Aaron 's sons the priests shall sprink@@ le the blood upon the altar round about .
if he offer a lamb for his offering , then shall he offer it before the LORD .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation : and Aaron 's sons shall sprink@@ le the blood thereof round about upon the altar .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it , and kill it before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation : and the sons of Aaron shall sprink@@ le the blood thereof upon the altar round about .
if the priest that is ano@@ inted do sin according to the sin of the people ; then let him bring for his sin , which he hath sin@@ ned , a young bul@@ lock without bl@@ emish unto the LORD for a sin offering .
when a ruler hath sin@@ ned , and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should not be done , and is guilty ;
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat , and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD : it is a sin offering .
or if his sin , which he hath sin@@ ned , come to his knowledge : then he shall bring his offering , a kid of the goats , a female without bl@@ emish , for his sin which he hath sin@@ ned .
and if a soul sin , and hear the voice of sw@@ earing , and is a witness , whether he hath seen or known of it ; if he do not utter it , then he shall bear his ini@@ qu@@ ity .
and if he be not able to bring a lamb , then he shall bring for his t@@ resp@@ ass , which he hath committed , two tur@@ t@@ le@@ d@@ oves , or two young pig@@ eons , unto the LORD ; one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering .
and if a soul sin , and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD ; though he w@@ ist it not , yet is he guilty , and shall bear his ini@@ qu@@ ity .
if a soul sin , and commit a t@@ resp@@ ass against the LORD , and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep , or in fellowship , or in a thing taken away by violence , or hath deceived his neighbour ;
and the priest shall put on his linen garment , and his linen bre@@ ech@@ es shall he put upon his flesh , and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar , and he shall put them beside the altar .
and he shall put off his garments , and put on other garments , and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place .
besides the cakes , he shall offer for his offering leav@@ ened bread with the sacrifice of thank@@ s@@ giving of his peace offerings .
and he brought the ram for the burnt offering : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram .
and he brought the other ram , the ram of consec@@ ration : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram .
and there came a fire out from before the LORD , and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat : which when all the people saw , they shouted , and fell on their faces .
and wh@@ oso@@ ever be@@ areth ought of the car@@ case of them shall wash his clothes , and be un@@ clean until the even .
and he that be@@ areth the car@@ case of them shall wash his clothes , and be un@@ clean until the even : they are un@@ clean unto you .
and he that e@@ at@@ eth of the car@@ case of it shall wash his clothes , and be un@@ clean until the even : he also that be@@ areth the car@@ case of it shall wash his clothes , and be un@@ clean until the even .
and she shall then continue in the blood of her puri@@ fying three and thirty days ; she shall touch no hal@@ lowed thing , nor come into the sanctuary , until the days of her puri@@ fying be fulfilled .
but if she bear a maid child , then she shall be un@@ clean two weeks , as in her separation : and she shall continue in the blood of her puri@@ fying thre@@ es@@ core and six days .
and the priest shall look on him again the seventh day : and , behold , if the plague be somewhat dark , and the plague spread not in the skin , the priest shall pron@@ ounce him clean : it is but a sc@@ ab : and he shall wash his clothes , and be clean .
and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the sc@@ all : and , behold , if the sc@@ all be not spread in the skin , nor be in sight deeper than the skin ; then the priest shall pron@@ ounce him clean : and he shall wash his clothes , and be clean .
but it shall be on the seventh day , that he shall s@@ have all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows , even all his hair he shall s@@ have off : and he shall wash his clothes , also he shall wash his flesh in water , and he shall be clean .
and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand , and shall sprink@@ le of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD :
and the priest shall sprink@@ le with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD :
and he that sit@@ t@@ eth on any thing where@@ on he sat that hath the issue shall wash his clothes , and ba@@ the himself in water , and be un@@ clean until the even .
and when he that hath an issue is cleans@@ ed of his issue ; then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing , and wash his clothes , and ba@@ the his flesh in running water , and shall be clean .
and on the eighth day he shall take to him two tur@@ t@@ le@@ d@@ oves , or two young pig@@ eons , and come before the LORD unto the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , and give them unto the priest :
and wh@@ oso@@ ever touch@@ eth any thing that she sat upon shall wash his clothes , and ba@@ the himself in water , and be un@@ clean until the even .
and wh@@ oso@@ ever touch@@ eth those things shall be un@@ clean , and shall wash his clothes , and ba@@ the himself in water , and be un@@ clean until the even .
thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their un@@ clean@@ ness ; that they die not in their un@@ clean@@ ness , when they def@@ ile my tab@@ ern@@ acle that is among them .
and there shall be no man in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation when he go@@ eth in to make an at@@ onement in the holy place , until he come out , and have made an at@@ onement for himself , and for his household , and for all the congregation of Israel .
and he shall sprink@@ le of the blood upon it with his finger seven times , and clean@@ se it , and hal@@ low it from the un@@ clean@@ ness of the children of Israel .
and the goat shall bear upon him all their ini@@ qu@@ ities unto a land not inhabited : and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness .
but if he wash them not , nor ba@@ the his flesh ; then he shall bear his ini@@ qu@@ ity .
that the land sp@@ ue not you out also , when ye def@@ ile it , as it sp@@ ued out the nations that were before you .
ye shall fear every man his mother , and his father , and keep my sab@@ baths : I am the LORD your God .
turn ye not unto idols , nor make to yourselves mol@@ ten gods : I am the LORD your God .
therefore every one that e@@ at@@ eth it shall bear his ini@@ qu@@ ity , because he hath prof@@ an@@ ed the hal@@ lowed thing of the LORD : and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
and when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field , neither shalt thou gather the g@@ lean@@ ings of thy harvest .
but the stranger that dwell@@ eth with you shall be unto you as one born among you , and thou shalt love him as thy@@ self ; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt : I am the LORD your God .
and if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man , when he gi@@ v@@ eth of his seed unto Mol@@ ech , and kill him not :
sancti@@ fy yourselves therefore , and be ye holy : for I am the LORD your God .
for every one that cur@@ set@@ h his father or his mother shall be surely put to death : he hath cur@@ sed his father or his mother ; his blood shall be upon him .
and the man that commit@@ t@@ eth adul@@ tery with another man 's wife , even he that commit@@ t@@ eth adul@@ tery with his neighbour 's wife , the adul@@ ter@@ er and the adul@@ ter@@ ess shall surely be put to death .
and if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness , and shall un@@ cover her n@@ ak@@ edness ; he hath discovered her fountain , and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood : and both of them shall be cut off from among their people .
and thou shalt not un@@ cover the n@@ ak@@ edness of thy mother 's sister , nor of thy father 's sister : for he un@@ cover@@ eth his near kin : they shall bear their ini@@ qu@@ ity .
ye shall therefore keep all my statutes , and all my judgments , and do them : that the land , whi@@ ther I bring you to dwell therein , sp@@ ue you not out .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Spe@@ ak unto the priests the sons of Aaron , and say unto them , There shall none be de@@ filed for the dead among his people :
and for his sister a virgin , that is ni@@ gh unto him , which hath had no husband ; for her may he be de@@ filed .
but he shall not def@@ ile himself , being a chief man among his people , to prof@@ ane himself .
they shall be holy unto their God , and not prof@@ ane the name of their God : for the offerings of the LORD made by fire , and the bread of their God , they do offer : therefore they shall be holy .
they shall not take a wife that is a wh@@ ore , or prof@@ ane ; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband : for he is holy unto his God .
thou shalt sancti@@ fy him therefore ; for he off@@ er@@ eth the bread of thy God : he shall be holy unto thee : for I the LORD , which sancti@@ fy you , am holy .
and he that is the high priest among his brethren , upon whose head the ano@@ in@@ ting oil was poured , and that is consec@@ rated to put on the garments , shall not un@@ cover his head , nor ren@@ d his clothes ;
neither shall he go in to any dead body , nor def@@ ile himself for his father , or for his mother ;
neither shall he prof@@ ane his seed among his people : for I the LORD do sancti@@ fy him .
speak unto Aaron , saying , Wh@@ oso@@ ever he be of thy seed in their generations that hath any bl@@ emish , let him not approach to offer the bread of his God .
or wh@@ oso@@ ever touch@@ eth any cre@@ eping thing , whereby he may be made un@@ clean , or a man of whom he may take un@@ clean@@ ness , whatsoever un@@ clean@@ ness he hath ;
they shall therefore keep mine ordin@@ ance , lest they bear sin for it , and die therefore , if they prof@@ ane it : I the LORD do sancti@@ fy them .
or suffer them to bear the ini@@ qu@@ ity of t@@ resp@@ ass , when they eat their holy things : for I the LORD do sancti@@ fy them .
and when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not make clean rid@@ dance of the corners of thy field when thou re@@ apest , neither shalt thou gather any g@@ leaning of thy harvest : thou shalt leave them unto the poor , and to the stranger : I am the LORD your God .
bring forth him that hath cur@@ sed without the camp ; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head , and let all the congregation stone him .
and thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel , saying , Wh@@ oso@@ ever cur@@ set@@ h his God shall bear his sin .
that which grow@@ eth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap , neither gather the grapes of thy vine und@@ ressed : for it is a year of rest unto the land .
and the sab@@ bath of the land shall be meat for you ; for thee , and for thy servant , and for thy maid , and for thy hired servant , and for thy stranger that so@@ jour@@ neth with thee ,
and thou shalt number seven sab@@ baths of years unto thee , seven times seven years ; and the space of the seven sab@@ baths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years .
then let him count the years of the sale thereof , and restore the over@@ plus unto the man to whom he sold it ; that he may return unto his possession .
and if thy brother be wa@@ x@@ en poor , and fallen in decay with thee ; then thou shalt relieve him : ye@@ a , though he be a stranger , or a so@@ jour@@ ner ; that he may live with thee .
but as an hired servant , and as a so@@ jour@@ ner , he shall be with thee , and shall serve thee unto the year of jub@@ ile :
both thy bond@@ men , and thy bond@@ m@@ aids , which thou shalt have , shall be of the he@@ a@@ then that are round about you ; of them shall ye buy bond@@ men and bond@@ m@@ aids .
and if a so@@ jour@@ ner or stranger wax rich by thee , and thy brother that dwell@@ eth by him wax poor , and sell himself unto the stranger or so@@ jour@@ ner by thee , or to the stock of the stranger 's family :
if there be yet many years behind , according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for .
ye shall make you no idols nor gra@@ ven image , neither rear you up a standing image , neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land , to bow down unto it : for I am the LORD your God .
and your strength shall be spent in vain : for your land shall not yield her increase , neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits .
then shall the land enjoy her sab@@ baths , as long as it li@@ eth des@@ ol@@ ate , and ye be in your enemies ' land ; even then shall the land rest , and enjoy her sab@@ baths .
if they shall confess their ini@@ qu@@ ity , and the ini@@ qu@@ ity of their fathers , with their t@@ resp@@ ass which they t@@ resp@@ assed against me , and that also they have walked contrary unto me ;
and when a man shall sancti@@ fy his house to be holy unto the LORD , then the priest shall estimate it , whether it be good or bad : as the priest shall estimate it , so shall it stand .
and if a man will at all re@@ deem ought of his ti@@ thes , he shall add there@@ to the fifth part thereof .
every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard , with the en@@ sign of their father 's house : far off about the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation shall they pitch .
all they that were numbered in the camp of Dan were an hundred thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred . they shall go hind@@ most with their standards .
and thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons , and they shall wait on their priest 's office : and the stranger that com@@ eth ni@@ gh shall be put to death .
both male and female shall ye put out , without the camp shall ye put them ; that they def@@ ile not their camps , in the midst where@@ of I dwell .
and the priest shall charge her by an oath , and say unto the woman , If no man have lain with thee , and if thou hast not gone aside to un@@ clean@@ ness with another instead of thy husband , be thou free from this bitter water that caus@@ eth the curse :
all the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree , from the ker@@ nels even to the hus@@ k .
and if any man die very suddenly by him , and he hath de@@ filed the head of his consec@@ ration ; then he shall s@@ have his head in the day of his cleansing , on the seventh day shall he s@@ have it .
the LORD lift up his coun@@ tenance upon thee , and give thee peace .
he offered for his offering one silver charger , the weight where@@ of was an hundred and thirty she@@ k@@ els , one silver bowl of seventy she@@ k@@ els , after the she@@ kel of the sanctuary ; both of them full of fine flour ming@@ led with oil for a meat offering :
and thus shalt thou do unto them , to clean@@ se them : sprink@@ le water of puri@@ fying upon them , and let them s@@ have all their flesh , and let them wash their clothes , and so make themselves clean .
and thou shalt bring the Lev@@ ites before the LORD : and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Lev@@ ites :
and the Lev@@ ites were purified , and they washed their clothes ; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD ; and Aaron made an at@@ onement for them to clean@@ se them .
and after that went the Lev@@ ites in to do their service in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation before Aaron , and before his sons : as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Lev@@ ites , so did they unto them .
but shall minister with their brethren in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , to keep the charge , and shall do no service . thus shalt thou do unto the Lev@@ ites touching their charge .
and the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai ; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Par@@ an .
then Moses heard the people we@@ ep throughout their families , every man in the door of his tent : and the anger of the LORD was kind@@ led greatly ; Moses also was dis@@ pleased .
and Moses said unto him , En@@ vi@@ est thou for my sake ? would God that all the LORD 's people were prophets , and that the LORD would put his spirit upon them !
and the people stood up all that day , and all that night , and all the next day , and they gathered the qu@@ ails : he that gathered least gathered ten hom@@ ers : and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp .
and Mi@@ ri@@ am and Aaron sp@@ ake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married : for he had married an Ethiopian woman .
and he said , He@@ ar now my words : if there be a prophet among you , I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision , and will speak unto him in a dream .
now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man , then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak , saying ,
and the LORD said , I have par@@ d@@ oned according to thy word :
speak unto the children of Israel , and bid them that they make them fring@@ es in the borders of their garments throughout their generations , and that they put upon the fring@@ e of the borders a rib@@ band of blue :
and when Moses heard it , he fell upon his face :
and he hath brought thee near to him , and all thy brethren the sons of Lev@@ i with thee : and seek ye the priesthood also ?
and Moses was very w@@ ro@@ th , and said unto the LORD , Resp@@ ect not thou their offering : I have not taken one ass from them , neither have I hurt one of them .
and they fell upon their faces , and said , O God , the God of the spirits of all flesh , shall one man sin , and wil@@ t thou be w@@ ro@@ th with all the congregation ?
so they G@@ at up from the tab@@ ern@@ acle of Kor@@ ah , Da@@ than , and A@@ bir@@ am , on every side : and Da@@ than and A@@ bir@@ am came out , and stood in the door of their tents , and their wives , and their sons , and their little children .
and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up , and their houses , and all the men that ap@@ per@@ tained unto Kor@@ ah , and all their goods .
get you up from among this congregation , that I may consume them as in a moment . and they fell upon their faces .
and the LORD said unto Aaron , Th@@ ou and thy sons and thy father 's house with thee shall bear the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the sanctuary : and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the ini@@ qu@@ ity of your priesthood .
and thy brethren also of the tribe of Lev@@ i , the tribe of thy father , bring thou with thee , that they may be joined unto thee , and minister unto thee : but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of witness .
in the most holy place shalt thou eat it ; every male shall eat it : it shall be holy unto thee .
then the priest shall wash his clothes , and he shall ba@@ the his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be un@@ clean until the even .
and Moses lifted up his hand , and with his rod he smo@@ te the rock twice : and the water came out ab@@ und@@ antly , and the congregation drank , and their beasts also .
and E@@ dom said unto him , Th@@ ou shalt not pass by me , lest I come out against thee with the sword .
Aaron shall be gathered unto his people : for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel , because ye reb@@ elled against my word at the water of M@@ eri@@ ba@@ h .
and Si@@ hon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border : but Si@@ hon gathered all his people together , and went out against Israel into the wilderness : and he came to Ja@@ haz , and fought against Israel .
and God came unto Bal@@ a@@ am , and said , What men are these with thee ?
and God 's anger was kind@@ led because he went : and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him . now he was riding upon his ass , and his two servants were with him .
and Bal@@ a@@ am said unto the ass , Because thou hast mo@@ cked me : I would there were a sword in mine hand , for now would I kill thee .
then the LORD opened the eyes of Bal@@ a@@ am , and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and he bowed down his head , and fell flat on his face .
and the angel of the LORD said unto him , W@@ herefore hast thou sm@@ it@@ ten th@@ ine ass these three times ? behold , I went out to withstand thee , because thy way is perverse before me :
and the ass saw me , and turned from me these three times : unless she had turned from me , surely now also I had sl@@ ain thee , and saved her alive .
and Bal@@ a@@ am said unto Bal@@ ak , L@@ o , I am come unto thee : have I now any power at all to say any thing ? the word that God put@@ t@@ eth in my mouth , that shall I speak .
and he took up his parable , and said , Bal@@ ak the king of Mo@@ ab hath brought me from A@@ ram , out of the mountains of the east , saying , Come , curse me Jacob , and come , defy Israel .
and he took up his parable , and said , R@@ ise up , Bal@@ ak , and hear ; hear@@ ken unto me , thou son of Zi@@ pp@@ or :
and Bal@@ ak said unto Bal@@ a@@ am , Come , I pray thee , I will bring thee unto another place ; per@@ adventure it will please God that thou may@@ est curse me them from th@@ ence .
and when Bal@@ a@@ am saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel , he went not , as at other times , to seek for enchan@@ tments , but he set his face toward the wilderness .
and he took up his parable , and said , Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Be@@ or hath said , and the man whose eyes are open hath said :
and now , behold , I go unto my people : come therefore , and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days .
and he took up his parable , and said , Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Be@@ or hath said , and the man whose eyes are open hath said :
and Moses said unto the judges of Israel , S@@ lay ye every one his men that were joined unto Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ pe@@ or .
and he shall have it , and his seed after him , even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood ; because he was z@@ eal@@ ous for his God , and made an at@@ onement for the children of Israel .
and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up together with Kor@@ ah , when that company died , what time the fire dev@@ oured two hundred and fifty men : and they became a sign .
our father died in the wilderness , and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Kor@@ ah ; but died in his own sin , and had no sons .
and when thou hast seen it , thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people , as Aaron thy brother was gathered .
if a man vo@@ w a vo@@ w unto the LORD , or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond ; he shall not break his word , he shall do according to all that proce@@ ed@@ eth out of his mouth .
if a woman also vo@@ w a vo@@ w unto the LORD , and bind herself by a bond , being in her father 's house in her youth ;
and her husband heard it , and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it : then her v@@ ows shall stand , and her bonds where@@ with she bound her soul shall stand .
and her husband heard it , and held his peace at her , and dis@@ allowed her not : then all her v@@ ows shall stand , and every bond where@@ with she bound her soul shall stand .
these are the statutes , which the LORD commanded Moses , between a man and his wife , between the father and his daughter , being yet in her youth in her father 's house .
and Moses sp@@ ake unto the people , saying , Ar@@ m some of yourselves unto the war , and let them go against the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites , and av@@ enge the LORD of Mi@@ dian .
but all the women children , that have not known a man by lying with him , keep alive for yourselves .
W@@ herefore , said they , if we have found grace in thy sight , let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession , and bring us not over Jordan .
and they came near unto him , and said , We will build she@@ ep@@ fol@@ ds here for our cattle , and cities for our little ones :
build you cities for your little ones , and fol@@ ds for your sheep ; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth .
these are the journeys of the children of Israel , which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron .
or in enmity sm@@ ite him with his hand , that he die : he that smo@@ te him shall surely be put to death ; for he is a murderer : the rev@@ enger of blood shall sl@@ ay the murderer , when he me@@ et@@ eth him .
because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the s@@ layer shall return into the land of his possession .
this is the thing which the LORD do@@ th command concerning the daughters of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had , saying , Let them marry to whom they think best ; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry .
so shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe : for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
for Mah@@ l@@ al , Tir@@ z@@ ah , and H@@ og@@ lah , and Mil@@ ca@@ h , and Noah , the daughters of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had , were married unto their father 's brothers ' sons :
and in the wilderness , where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee , as a man do@@ th bear his son , in all the way that ye went , until ye came into this place .
but Si@@ hon king of H@@ esh@@ bon would not let us pass by him : for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit , and made his heart obst@@ inate , that he might deliver him into thy hand , as appe@@ areth this day .
only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves , and the spoil of the cities which we took .
then we turned , and went up the way to Bash@@ an : and O@@ g the king of Bash@@ an came out against us , he and all his people , to battle at E@@ dre@@ i .
and the LORD said unto me , Fe@@ ar him not : for I will deliver him , and all his people , and his land , into thy hand ; and thou shalt do unto him as thou did@@ st unto Si@@ hon king of the A@@ mor@@ ites , which d@@ wel@@ t at H@@ esh@@ bon .
J@@ air the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h took all the country of Ar@@ go@@ b unto the co@@ asts of G@@ es@@ hur@@ i and Ma@@ acha@@ th@@ i ; and called them after his own name , Bash@@ an @@@ -@@ @ ha@@ vo@@ th @@@ -@@ @ J@@ air , unto this day .
thou shalt keep therefore his statutes , and his commandments , which I command thee this day , that it may go well with thee , and with thy children after thee , and that thou may@@ est prolong thy days upon the earth , which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee , for ever .
that the s@@ layer might flee thi@@ ther , which should kill his neighbour un@@ awa@@ res , and hated him not in times past ; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live :
honour thy father and thy mother , as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee ; that thy days may be prolonged , and that it may go well with thee , in the land which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee .
that thou mi@@ gh@@ test fear the LORD thy God , to keep all his statutes and his commandments , which I command thee , thou , and thy son , and thy son 's son , all the days of thy life ; and that thy days may be prolonged .
and these words , which I command thee this day , shall be in th@@ ine heart :
and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house , and on thy gates .
neither shalt thou make marriages with them ; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son , nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son .
for they will turn away thy son from following me , that they may serve other gods : so will the anger of the LORD be kind@@ led against you , and destroy thee suddenly .
W@@ herefore it shall come to pass , if ye hear@@ ken to these judgments , and keep , and do them , that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sw@@ are unto thy fathers :
and thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee ; th@@ ine eye shall have no pity upon them : neither shalt thou serve their gods ; for that will be a sn@@ are unto thee .
and he shall deliver their kings into th@@ ine hand , and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven : there shall no man be able to stand before thee , until thou have destroyed them .
and thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness , to humble thee , and to prove thee , to know what was in th@@ ine heart , whether thou w@@ oul@@ dest keep his commandments , or no .
thou shalt also consider in th@@ ine heart , that , as a man cha@@ sten@@ eth his son , so the LORD thy God cha@@ sten@@ eth thee .
who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness , where@@ in were fiery ser@@ p@@ ents , and scor@@ pi@@ ons , and drought , where there was no water ; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of fl@@ int ;
but thou shalt remember the LORD thy God : for it is he that gi@@ v@@ eth thee power to get wealth , that he may establish his covenant which he sw@@ are unto thy fathers , as it is this day .
so I turned and came down from the mount , and the mount burned with fire : and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands .
at that time the LORD said unto me , H@@ ew thee two tables of stone like unto the first , and come up unto me into the mount , and make thee an ark of wood .
for the land , whi@@ ther thou go@@ est in to possess it , is not as the land of Egypt , from wh@@ ence ye came out , where thou s@@ ow@@ ed@@ st thy seed , and water@@ ed@@ st it with thy foot , as a garden of herbs :
and I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle , that thou may@@ est eat and be full .
and thou shalt write them upon the door posts of th@@ ine house , and upon thy gates :
these are the statutes and judgments , which ye shall observe to do in the land , which the LORD God of thy fathers gi@@ v@@ eth thee to possess it , all the days that ye live upon the earth .
ye shall utterly destroy all the places , where@@ in the nations which ye shall possess served their gods , upon the high mountains , and upon the hills , and under every green tree :
take heed to thy@@ self that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou se@@ est :
but in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes , there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings , and there thou shalt do all that I command thee .
when the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border , as he hath promised thee , and thou shalt say , I will eat flesh , because thy soul long@@ eth to eat flesh ; thou may@@ est eat flesh , whatsoever thy soul lu@@ st@@ eth after .
observe and hear all these words which I command thee , that it may go well with thee , and with thy children after thee for ever , when thou do@@ est that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God .
thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God : for every ab@@ om@@ ination to the LORD , which he hat@@ eth , have they done unto their gods ; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods .
if thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities , which the LORD thy God hath given thee to dwell there , saying ,
and there shall cle@@ ave n@@ ought of the cur@@ sed thing to th@@ ine hand : that the LORD may turn from the fierc@@ eness of his anger , and sh@@ ew thee mercy , and have compassion upon thee , and multiply thee , as he hath sworn unto thy fathers ;
thou shalt truly ti@@ the all the increase of thy seed , that the field br@@ ing@@ eth forth year by year .
and the Lev@@ ite that is within thy gates ; thou shalt not for@@ sake him ; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee .
at the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the ti@@ the of th@@ ine increase the same year , and shalt lay it up within thy gates :
and this is the manner of the release : every creditor that len@@ det@@ h ought unto his neighbour shall release it ; he shall not exact it of his neighbour , or of his brother ; because it is called the LORD 's release .
thou shalt surely give him , and th@@ ine heart shall not be griev@@ ed when thou gi@@ v@@ est unto him : because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works , and in all that thou put@@ test th@@ ine hand unto .
for the poor shall never cease out of the land : therefore I command thee , saying , Th@@ ou shalt open th@@ ine hand wide unto thy brother , to thy poor , and to thy ne@@ edy , in thy land .
and if thy brother , an Hebrew man , or an Hebrew woman , be sold unto thee , and serve thee six years ; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee .
and when thou s@@ end@@ est him out free from thee , thou shalt not let him go away empty :
thou shalt fur@@ nish him liber@@ ally out of thy flock , and out of thy floor , and out of thy win@@ ep@@ ress : of that where@@ with the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him .
and it shall be , if he say unto thee , I will not go away from thee ; because he lov@@ eth thee and th@@ ine house , because he is well with thee ;
thou shalt eat it within thy gates : the un@@ clean and the clean person shall eat it alike , as the Ro@@ e@@ buck , and as the hart .
thou shalt observe the feast of tab@@ ern@@ acles seven days , after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine :
judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates , which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee , throughout thy tribes : and they shall judge the people with just judgment .
if there be found among you , within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee , man or woman , that hath wrought w@@ ick@@ edness in the sight of the LORD thy God , in Trans@@ gres@@ sing his covenant ,
if there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment , between blood and blood , between ple@@ a and ple@@ a , and between stroke and stroke , being matters of controversy within thy gates : then shalt thou arise , and get thee up into the place which the LORD thy God shall choose ;
and the man that will do presu@@ mp@@ tu@@ ously , and will not hear@@ ken unto the priest that stand@@ eth to minister there before the LORD thy God , or unto the judge , even that man shall die : and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel .
thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee , whom the LORD thy God shall choose : one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee : thou may@@ est not set a stranger over thee , which is not thy brother .
and it shall be with him , and he shall read therein all the days of his life : that he may learn to fear the LORD his God , to keep all the words of this law and these statutes , to do them :
then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God , as all his brethren the Lev@@ ites do , which stand there before the LORD .
thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God .
thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land , which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee to possess it .
and this is the case of the s@@ layer , which shall flee thi@@ ther , that he may live : wh@@ os@@ o kill@@ eth his neighbour ignor@@ antly , whom he hated not in time past ;
and if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast , as he hath sworn unto thy fathers , and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers ;
that innocent blood be not shed in thy land , which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee for an inheritance , and so blood be upon thee .
thou shalt not remove thy neighbour 's landmark , which they of old time have set in th@@ ine inheritance , which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee to possess it .
and the officers shall speak unto the people , saying , What man is there that hath built a new house , and hath not dedicated it ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man dedic@@ ate it .
and what man is he that hath planted a viney@@ ard , and hath not yet eaten of it ? let him also go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man eat of it .
and what man is there that hath bet@@ ro@@ thed a wife , and hath not taken her ? let him go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her .
and the officers shall speak further unto the people , and they shall say , What man is there that is fearful and fain@@ the@@ ar@@ ted ? let him go and return unto his house , lest his brethren 's heart faint as well as his heart .
and when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into th@@ ine hands , thou shalt sm@@ ite every male thereof with the edge of the sword :
that they teach you not to do after all their ab@@ om@@ inations , which they have done unto their gods ; so should ye sin against the LORD your God .
and all the elders of that city , that are next unto the sl@@ ain man , shall wash their hands over the hei@@ fer that is be@@ headed in the valley :
and se@@ est among the cap@@ tives a beautiful woman , and hast a desire unto her , that thou w@@ oul@@ dest have her to thy wife ;
then thou shalt bring her home to th@@ ine house ; and she shall s@@ have her head , and p@@ are her nails ;
if a man have a stubborn and rebelli@@ ous son , which will not obey the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and that , when they have cha@@ st@@ ened him , will not hear@@ ken unto them :
the woman shall not wear that which per@@ tain@@ eth unto a man , neither shall a man put on a woman 's garment : for all that do so are ab@@ om@@ ination unto the LORD thy God .
when thou buil@@ dest a new house , then thou shalt make a batt@@ l@@ ement for thy roof , that thou bring not blood upon th@@ ine house , if any man fall from th@@ ence .
thou shalt not sow thy viney@@ ard with divers seeds : lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast s@@ own , and the fruit of thy viney@@ ard , be de@@ filed .
thou shalt make thee fring@@ es upon the four quarters of thy vest@@ ure , where@@ with thou cover@@ est thy@@ self .
but unto the dam@@ sel thou shalt do nothing ; there is in the dam@@ sel no sin worthy of death : for as when a man ris@@ eth against his neighbour , and s@@ lay@@ eth him , even so is this matter :
then the man that lay with her shall give unto the dam@@ sel 's father fifty she@@ k@@ els of silver , and she shall be his wife ; because he hath hum@@ bled her , he may not put her away all his days .
when the host go@@ eth forth against th@@ ine enemies , then keep thee from every wicked thing .
thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee :
thou shalt not bring the hire of a wh@@ ore , or the price of a dog , into the house of the LORD thy God for any vo@@ w : for even both these are ab@@ om@@ ination unto the LORD thy God .
thou shalt not lend upon us@@ ury to thy brother ; us@@ ury of money , us@@ ury of vic@@ tu@@ als , us@@ ury of any thing that is lent upon us@@ ury :
unto a stranger thou may@@ est lend upon us@@ ury ; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon us@@ ury : that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all that thou sett@@ est th@@ ine hand to in the land whi@@ ther thou go@@ est to possess it .
and if the latter husband hate her , and write her a bill of divor@@ cement , and gi@@ v@@ eth it in her hand , and sen@@ det@@ h her out of his house ; or if the latter husband die , which took her to be his wife ;
when thou d@@ ost lend thy brother any thing , thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge .
thou shalt stand abroad , and the man to whom thou d@@ ost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee .
in any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun go@@ eth down , that he may sleep in his own ra@@ iment , and bless thee : and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God .
thou shalt not op@@ press an hired servant that is poor and ne@@ edy , whether he be of thy brethren , or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates :
when thou cut@@ test down th@@ ine harvest in thy field , and hast forgot a she@@ af in the field , thou shalt not go again to fetch it : it shall be for the stranger , for the fa@@ ther@@ less , and for the widow : that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of th@@ ine hands .
when thou gather@@ est the grapes of thy viney@@ ard , thou shalt not g@@ lean it afterward : it shall be for the stranger , for the fa@@ ther@@ less , and for the widow .
but thou shalt have a perfect and just weight , a perfect and just measure shalt thou have : that thy days may be leng@@ th@@ ened in the land which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee .
therefore it shall be , when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all th@@ ine enemies round about , in the land which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee for an inheritance to possess it , that thou shalt b@@ lot out the rem@@ embrance of A@@ mal@@ ek from under heaven ; thou shalt not forget it .
and now , behold , I have brought the fir@@ st@@ fruits of the land , which thou , O LORD , hast given me . and thou shalt set it before the LORD thy God , and worship before the LORD thy God :
and thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy God hath given unto thee , and unto th@@ ine house , thou , and the Lev@@ ite , and the stranger that is among you .
look down from thy holy hab@@ itation , from heaven , and bless thy people Israel , and the land which thou hast given us , as thou sw@@ arest unto our fathers , a land that flow@@ eth with milk and honey .
this day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments : thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all th@@ ine heart , and with all thy soul .
thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones : and thou shalt offer burnt offerings there@@ on unto the LORD thy God :
and thou shalt offer peace offerings , and shalt eat there , and rejoice before the LORD thy God .
cur@@ sed be he that sett@@ eth light by his father or his mother . and all the people shall say , A@@ men .
cur@@ sed be he that remo@@ v@@ eth his neighbour 's landmark . and all the people shall say , A@@ men .
cur@@ sed be he that li@@ eth with his sister , the daughter of his father , or the daughter of his mother . and all the people shall say , A@@ men .
cur@@ sed be he that sm@@ it@@ eth his neighbour secretly . and all the people shall say , A@@ men .
and all these blessings shall come on thee , and over@@ take thee , if thou shalt hear@@ ken unto the voice of the LORD thy God .
blessed shall be the fruit of thy body , and the fruit of thy ground , and the fruit of thy cattle , the increase of thy k@@ ine , and the f@@ locks of thy sheep .
the LORD shall cause th@@ ine enemies that rise up against thee to be sm@@ it@@ ten before thy face : they shall come out against thee one way , and flee before thee seven ways .
the LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy store@@ houses , and in all that thou sett@@ est th@@ ine hand unto ; and he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee .
but it shall come to pass , if thou wil@@ t not hear@@ ken unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day ; that all these cur@@ ses shall come upon thee , and over@@ take thee :
the LORD shall make the pesti@@ l@@ ence cle@@ ave unto thee , until he have consumed thee from off the land , whi@@ ther thou go@@ est to possess it .
th@@ ine ox shall be sl@@ ain before th@@ ine eyes , and thou shalt not eat thereof : th@@ ine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face , and shall not be restored to thee : thy sheep shall be given unto th@@ ine enemies , and thou shalt have none to rescue them .
the fruit of thy land , and all thy lab@@ ours , shall a nation which thou know@@ est not eat up ; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed al@@ way :
the LORD shall sm@@ ite thee in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore bot@@ ch that C@@ AN@@ NOT be healed , from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head .
the LORD shall bring thee , and thy king which thou shalt set over thee , unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known ; and there shalt thou serve other gods , wood and stone .
thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy co@@ asts , but thou shalt not ano@@ int thy@@ self with the oil ; for th@@ ine olive shall cast his fruit .
thou shalt be@@ get sons and daughters , but thou shalt not enjoy them ; for they shall go into cap@@ tivity .
moreover all these cur@@ ses shall come upon thee , and shall pursue thee , and over@@ take thee , till thou be destroyed ; because thou hear@@ ken@@ ed@@ st not unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee :
therefore shalt thou serve th@@ ine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee , in hunger , and in thirst , and in n@@ ak@@ edness , and in want of all things : and he shall put a y@@ oke of iron upon thy neck , until he have destroyed thee .
and thou shalt eat the fruit of th@@ ine own body , the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters , which the LORD thy God hath given thee , in the siege , and in the stra@@ it@@ ness , where@@ with th@@ ine enemies shall distress thee :
so that the man that is tender among you , and very delicate , his eye shall be evil toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bos@@ om , and toward the remn@@ ant of his children which he shall leave :
so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat : because he hath nothing left him in the siege , and in the stra@@ it@@ ness , where@@ with th@@ ine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates .
and among these nations shalt thou find no ease , neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest : but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and sorrow of mind :
your little ones , your wives , and thy stranger that is in thy camp , from the he@@ wer of thy wood unto the draw@@ er of thy water :
and it shall come to pass , when all these things are come upon thee , the blessing and the curse , which I have set before thee , and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations , whi@@ ther the LORD thy God hath driven thee ,
and shalt return unto the LORD thy God , and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day , thou and thy children , with all th@@ ine heart , and with all thy soul ;
and the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed , and thou shalt possess it ; and he will do thee good , and multiply thee above thy fathers .
it is not in heaven , that thou shoul@@ dest say , Who shall go up for us to heaven , and bring it unto us , that we may hear it , and do it ?
but the word is very ni@@ gh unto thee , in thy mouth , and in thy heart , that thou may@@ est do it .
gather the people together , men , and women , and children , and thy stranger that is within thy gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear the LORD your God , and observe to do all the words of this law :
and I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought , in that they are turned unto other gods .
see now that I , even I , am he , and there is no god with me : I kill , and I make alive ; I wound , and I heal : neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand .
because ye t@@ resp@@ assed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of M@@ eri@@ ba@@ h @@@ -@@ @ Kad@@ esh , in the wilderness of Z@@ in ; because ye sancti@@ fied me not in the midst of the children of Israel .
yet thou shalt see the land before thee ; but thou shalt not go thi@@ ther unto the land which I give the children of Israel .
ye@@ a , he loved the people ; all his saints are in thy hand : and they sat down at thy feet ; every one shall receive of thy words .
and of Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n he said , Re@@ jo@@ ice , Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n , in thy going out ; and , Is@@ sac@@ har , in thy tents .
and of Ash@@ er he said , Let Ash@@ er be blessed with children ; let him be acceptable to his brethren , and let him dip his foot in oil .
Israel then shall dwell in safety alone : the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine ; also his heavens shall drop down de@@ w .
happy art thou , O Israel : who is like unto thee , O people saved by the LORD , the shield of thy help , and who is the sword of thy excell@@ ency ! and th@@ ine enemies shall be found li@@ ars unto thee ; and thou shalt t@@ read upon their high places .
there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life : as I was with Moses , so I will be with thee : I will not fail thee , nor for@@ sake thee .
this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth ; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night , that thou may@@ est observe to do according to all that is written therein : for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous , and then thou shalt have good success .
wh@@ oso@@ ever he be that do@@ th rebel against thy commandment , and will not hear@@ ken unto thy words in all that thou command@@ est him , he shall be put to death : only be strong and of a good courage .
and as soon as we had heard these things , our hearts did melt , neither did there remain any more courage in any man , because of you : for the LORD your God , he is God in heaven above , and in earth beneath .
and as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan , and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were di@@ pped in the bri@@ m of the water , ( for Jordan over@@ flow@@ eth all his banks all the time of harvest , )
at that time the LORD said unto Joshua , Make thee sharp kni@@ ves , and circum@@ c@@ ise again the children of Israel the second time .
and he said , N@@ ay ; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come . and Joshua fell on his face to the earth , and did worship , and said unto him , What sa@@ ith my lord unto his servant ?
and Joshua rent his clothes , and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the ev@@ enti@@ de , he and the elders of Israel , and put dust upon their heads .
therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies , but turned their backs before their enemies , because they were accur@@ sed : neither will I be with you any more , except ye destroy the accur@@ sed from among you .
up , sancti@@ fy the people , and say , Sanc@@ ti@@ fy yourselves against to mor@@ row : for thus sa@@ ith the LORD God of Israel , There is an accur@@ sed thing in the midst of thee , O Israel : thou can@@ st not stand before th@@ ine enemies , until ye take away the accur@@ sed thing from among you .
and the LORD said unto Joshua , Fe@@ ar not , neither be thou dis@@ may@@ ed : take all the people of war with thee , and arise , go up to A@@ i : see , I have given into thy hand the king of A@@ i , and his people , and his city , and his land :
and the amb@@ ush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand : and they entered into the city , and took it , and ha@@ sted and set the city on fire .
for Joshua drew not his hand back , where@@ with he stretched out the spe@@ ar , until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of A@@ i .
only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves , according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua .
they did work wil@@ ily , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old s@@ acks upon their asses , and wine bottles , old , and rent , and bound up ;
and the LORD said unto Joshua , Fe@@ ar them not : for I have delivered them into th@@ ine hand ; there shall not a man of them stand before thee .
and all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Mak@@ k@@ ed@@ ah in peace : none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel .
with whom the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites and the G@@ ad@@ ites have received their inheritance , which Moses gave them , beyond Jordan eastward , even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them ;
nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt : but I wholly followed the LORD my God .
and Joshua sp@@ ake unto the house of Joseph , even to E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and to Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , saying , Th@@ ou art a great people , and hast great power : thou shalt not have one lot only :
give out from among you three men for each tribe : and I will send them , and they shall rise , and go through the land , and describe it according to the inheritance of them ; and they shall come again to me .
and they shall divide it into seven parts : Jud@@ ah shall abide in their coast on the south , and the house of Joseph shall abide in their co@@ asts on the north .
and the children of Israel gave unto the Lev@@ ites out of their inheritance , at the commandment of the LORD , these cities and their suburbs .
and said unto them , Y@@ e have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you , and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you :
ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day , but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God .
so Joshua blessed them , and sent them away : and they went unto their tents .
and Joshua said unto the people , Y@@ e are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD , to serve him . and they said , We are witnesses .
and Ad@@ oni @@@ -@@ @ B@@ ez@@ ek said , thre@@ es@@ core and ten kings , having their thum@@ bs and their great toes cut off , gathered their meat under my table : as I have done , so God hath requ@@ ited me . and they brought him to Jerusalem , and there he died .
and they took their daughters to be their wives , and gave their daughters to their sons , and served their gods .
and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD , and for@@ g@@ at the LORD their God , and served Ba@@ ali@@ m and the gro@@ ves .
and he gathered unto him the children of Am@@ mon and A@@ mal@@ ek , and went and smo@@ te Israel , and possessed the city of palm trees .
but Ehud made him a d@@ ag@@ ger which had two edges , of a cub@@ it length ; and he did gir@@ d it under his ra@@ iment upon his right thi@@ gh .
but he himself turned again from the quar@@ ries that were by Gil@@ gal , and said , I have a secret err@@ and unto thee , O king : who said , Keep silence . and all that stood by him went out from him .
and Ehud came unto him ; and he was sitting in a summer parl@@ our , which he had for himself alone . and Ehud said , I have a message from God unto thee . and he arose out of his seat .
and Ehud put forth his left hand , and took the d@@ ag@@ ger from his right thi@@ gh , and thrust it into his belly :
and she d@@ wel@@ t under the palm tree of De@@ bor@@ ah between Ram@@ ah and Be@@ the@@ l in mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment .
and S@@ is@@ era gathered together all his ch@@ ari@@ ots , even nine hundred ch@@ ari@@ ots of iron , and all the people that were with him , from Har@@ osh@@ eth of the Genti@@ les unto the river of K@@ ish@@ on .
awake , awake , De@@ bor@@ ah : awake , awake , utter a song : arise , Bar@@ ak , and lead thy cap@@ tivity captive , thou son of Ab@@ ino@@ am .
Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n and N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i were a people that jeopar@@ ded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field .
for they came up with their cattle and their tents , and they came as gras@@ shop@@ pers for multitude ; for both they and their cam@@ els were without number : and they entered into the land to destroy it .
and the LORD looked upon him , and said , Go in this thy might , and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites : have not I sent thee ?
depart not hence , I pray thee , until I come unto thee , and bring forth my present , and set it before thee . and he said , I will tar@@ ry until thou come again .
so the people took vic@@ tu@@ als in their hand , and their trum@@ pets : and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent , and retained those three hundred men : and the host of Mi@@ dian was beneath him in the valley .
and he came unto the men of S@@ uc@@ co@@ th , and said , Be@@ hold Ze@@ ba@@ h and Z@@ al@@ mun@@ na , with whom ye did up@@ bra@@ id me , saying , Are the hands of Ze@@ ba@@ h and Z@@ al@@ mun@@ na now in th@@ ine hand , that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary ?
thus was Mi@@ dian subdued before the children of Israel , so that they lifted up their heads no more . and the country was in qui@@ et@@ ness forty years in the days of G@@ ide@@ on .
and he went unto his father 's house at O@@ ph@@ rah , and sle@@ w his brethren the sons of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al , being thre@@ es@@ core and ten persons , upon one stone : notwithstanding yet Jo@@ th@@ am the youngest son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al was left ; for he hid himself .
and when they told it to Jo@@ th@@ am , he went and stood in the top of mount Ger@@ iz@@ im , and lifted up his voice , and cried , and said unto them , hear@@ ken unto me , ye men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , that God may hear@@ ken unto you .
and the br@@ am@@ ble said unto the trees , If in truth ye ano@@ int me king over you , then come and put your trust in my shadow : and if not , let fire come out of the br@@ am@@ ble , and dev@@ our the c@@ ed@@ ars of Lebanon .
and Ga@@ al the son of E@@ bed came with his brethren , and went over to Sh@@ ec@@ hem : and the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem put their confidence in him .
and he sent messengers unto Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h priv@@ ily , saying , Be@@ hold , Ga@@ al the son of E@@ bed and his brethren be come to Sh@@ ec@@ hem ; and , behold , they forti@@ fy the city against thee .
and they put away the strange gods from among them , and served the LORD : and his soul was griev@@ ed for the misery of Israel .
then J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah fled from his brethren , and d@@ wel@@ t in the land of To@@ b : and there were gathered vain men to J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah , and went out with him .
and the elders of Gil@@ e@@ ad said unto J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah , The LORD be witness between us , if we do not so according to thy words .
then J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah went with the elders of Gil@@ e@@ ad , and the people made him head and captain over them : and J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah uttered all his words before the LORD in M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h .
but Si@@ hon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast : but Si@@ hon gathered all his people together , and pit@@ ched in Ja@@ haz , and fought against Israel .
and J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah came to M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h unto his house , and , behold , his daughter came out to meet him with tim@@ b@@ rels and with dances : and she was his only child ; beside her he had neither son nor daughter .
and he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , I have seen a woman in Tim@@ nat@@ h of the daughters of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : now therefore get her for me to wife .
then went Sam@@ son down , and his father and his mother , to Tim@@ nat@@ h , and came to the vineyards of Tim@@ nat@@ h : and , behold , a young lion ro@@ ared against him .
and the Spirit of the LORD came mi@@ gh@@ tily upon him , and he rent him as he would have rent a kid , and he had nothing in his hand : but he told not his father or his mother what he had done .
and he found a new j@@ aw@@ bone of an ass , and put forth his hand , and took it , and sle@@ w a thousand men there@@ with .
and he was sore ath@@ ir@@ st , and called on the LORD , and said , Th@@ ou hast given this great deliver@@ ance into the hand of thy servant : and now shall I die for thirst , and fall into the hand of the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised ?
and the man Mic@@ ah had an house of gods , and made an ep@@ ho@@ d , and ter@@ ap@@ him , and consec@@ rated one of his sons , who became his priest .
and they came unto their brethren to Zor@@ ah and E@@ sh@@ ta@@ ol : and their brethren said unto them , What say ye ?
and he said , Y@@ e have taken away my gods which I made , and the priest , and ye are gone away : and what have I more ? and what is this that ye say unto me , What ail@@ eth thee ?
and the children of Dan went their way : and when Mic@@ ah saw that they were too strong for him , he turned and went back unto his house .
and the children of Dan set up the gra@@ ven image : and Jonathan , the son of Ger@@ sh@@ om , the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the cap@@ tivity of the land .
and they set them up Mic@@ ah 's gra@@ ven image , which he made , all the time that the house of God was in Sh@@ il@@ oh .
and , behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at even , which was also of mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; and he so@@ jour@@ ned in Gi@@ be@@ ah : but the men of the place were Ben@@ jam@@ ites .
yet there is both straw and pro@@ ven@@ der for our asses ; and there is bread and wine also for me , and for thy hand@@ maid , and for the young man which is with thy servants : there is no want of any thing .
so he brought him into his house , and gave pro@@ ven@@ der unto the asses : and they washed their feet , and did eat and drink .
and all the people arose as one man , saying , We will not any of us go to his tent , neither will we any of us turn into his house .
and the children of Israel rep@@ ented them for Benjamin their brother , and said , There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day .
and the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wives , according to their number , of them that danced , whom they caught : and they went and returned unto their inheritance , and repaired the cities , and d@@ wel@@ t in them .
and the children of Israel departed th@@ ence at that time , every man to his tribe and to his family , and they went out from th@@ ence every man to his inheritance .
and Na@@ omi said unto her two daughters in law , Go , return each to her mother 's house : the LORD deal kindly with you , as ye have dealt with the dead , and with me .
and she said , Be@@ hold , thy sister in law is gone back unto her people , and unto her gods : return thou after thy sister in law .
then said Bo@@ az unto his servant that was set over the re@@ apers , Wh@@ ose dam@@ sel is this ?
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said unto him , Why have I found grace in th@@ ine eyes , that thou shoul@@ dest take knowledge of me , seeing I am a stranger ?
and she took it up , and went into the city : and her mother in law saw what she had g@@ leaned : and she brought forth , and gave to her that she had reserved after she was suff@@ iced .
and she said , These six measures of barley gave he me ; for he said to me , Go not empty unto thy mother in law .
and the kin@@ sman said , I C@@ AN@@ NOT re@@ deem it for myself , lest I mar mine own inheritance : re@@ deem thou my right to thy@@ self ; for I C@@ AN@@ NOT re@@ deem it .
now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning re@@ deem@@ ing and concerning changing , for to confirm all things ; a man pl@@ ucked off his shoe , and gave it to his neighbour : and this was a testimony in Israel .
therefore the kin@@ sman said unto Bo@@ az , Buy it for thee . so he drew off his shoe .
and this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Sh@@ il@@ oh . and the two sons of El@@ i , Hop@@ hn@@ i and Ph@@ ine@@ has , the priests of the LORD , were there .
then said El@@ kan@@ ah her husband to her , Hann@@ ah , why we@@ ep@@ est thou ? and why e@@ at@@ est thou not ? and why is thy heart griev@@ ed ? am not I better to thee than ten sons ?
now Hann@@ ah , she sp@@ ake in her heart ; only her lips moved , but her voice was not heard : therefore El@@ i thought she had been drun@@ ken .
count not th@@ ine hand@@ maid for a daughter of Beli@@ al : for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto .
and she said , Let th@@ ine hand@@ maid find grace in thy sight . so the woman went her way , and did eat , and her coun@@ tenance was no more sad .
and they rose up in the morning early , and wor@@ shipped before the LORD , and returned , and came to their house to Ram@@ ah : and El@@ kan@@ ah knew Hann@@ ah his wife ; and the LORD remembered her .
there is none holy as the LORD : for there is none beside thee : neither is there any rock like our God .
and he struck it into the pan , or kettle , or cal@@ dr@@ on , or pot ; all that the fl@@ esh@@ hook brought up the priest took for himself . so they did in Sh@@ il@@ oh unto all the Israel@@ ites that came thi@@ ther .
moreover his mother made him a little coat , and brought it to him from year to year , when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice .
behold , the days come , that I will cut off th@@ ine arm , and the arm of thy father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in th@@ ine house .
and I will raise me up a faithful priest , that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind : and I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before mine ano@@ inted for ever .
and when they of Ash@@ do@@ d arose early on the mor@@ row , behold , D@@ agon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD . and they took D@@ agon , and set him in his place again .
and Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life .
and he said , This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them for himself , for his ch@@ ari@@ ots , and to be his hor@@ sem@@ en ; and some shall run before his ch@@ ari@@ ots .
and he will appoint him cap@@ tains over thousands , and cap@@ tains over fif@@ ties ; and will set them to ear his ground , and to reap his harvest , and to make his instruments of war , and instruments of his ch@@ ari@@ ots .
and he will take the tenth of your seed , and of your vineyards , and give to his officers , and to his servants .
and the asses of K@@ ish Saul 's father were lost . and K@@ ish said to Saul his son , Take now one of the servants with thee , and arise , go seek the asses .
and when Samuel saw Saul , the LORD said unto him , Be@@ hold the man whom I sp@@ ake to thee of ! this same shall reign over my people .
and Samuel answered Saul , and said , I am the se@@ er : go up before me unto the high place ; for ye shall eat with me to day , and to mor@@ row I will let thee go , and will tell thee all that is in th@@ ine heart .
and Samuel said unto the cook , B@@ ring the portion which I gave thee , of which I said unto thee , Set it by thee .
and Saul said unto his uncle , He told us plainly that the asses were found . but of the matter of the kingdom , where@@ of Samuel sp@@ ake , he told him not .
and they ran and fetched him th@@ ence : and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward .
and Saul also went home to Gi@@ be@@ ah ; and there went with him a band of men , whose hearts God had touched .
and now , behold , the king wal@@ ket@@ h before you : and I am old and gra@@ y@@ headed ; and , behold , my sons are with you : and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day .
and when they for@@ g@@ at the LORD their God , he sold them into the hand of S@@ is@@ era , captain of the host of Haz@@ or , and into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and into the hand of the king of Mo@@ ab , and they fought against them .
and all the people said unto Samuel , Pr@@ ay for thy servants unto the LORD thy God , that we die not : for we have added unto all our sins this evil , to ask us a king .
for , as the LORD liv@@ eth , which sav@@ eth Israel , though it be in Jonathan my son , he shall surely die . but there was not a man among all the people that answered him .
then said he unto all Israel , Be ye on one side , and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side . and the people said unto Saul , Do what seem@@ eth good unto thee .
and there was sore war against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines all the days of Saul : and when Saul saw any strong man , or any val@@ i@@ ant man , he took him unto him .
and Saul said , They have brought them from the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites : for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the ox@@ en , to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God ; and the rest we have utterly destroyed .
and Samuel said , When thou w@@ ast little in th@@ ine own sight , w@@ ast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel , and the LORD ano@@ inted thee king over Israel ?
then he said , I have sin@@ ned : yet honour me now , I pray thee , before the elders of my people , and before Israel , and turn again with me , that I may worship the LORD thy God .
and Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death : nevertheless Samuel mour@@ ned for Saul : and the LORD rep@@ ented that he had made Saul king over Israel .
let our lord now command thy servants , which are before thee , to seek out a man , who is a cunning player on an har@@ p : and it shall come to pass , when the evil spirit from God is upon thee , that he shall play with his hand , and thou shalt be well .
and Saul sent to Jes@@ se , saying , Let David , I pray thee , stand before me ; for he hath found favour in my sight .
now the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered together their armies to battle , and were gathered together at Sho@@ cho@@ h , which belong@@ eth to Jud@@ ah , and pit@@ ched between Sho@@ cho@@ h and A@@ ze@@ k@@ ah , in E@@ ph@@ es @@@ -@@ @ dam@@ mi@@ m .
but David went and returned from Saul to feed his father 's sheep at Bethlehem .
and David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage , and ran into the army , and came and sal@@ uted his brethren .
and David said unto Saul , Th@@ y servant kept his father 's sheep , and there came a lion , and a bear , and took a lamb out of the flock :
and David put his hand in his bag , and took th@@ ence a stone , and slan@@ g it , and smo@@ te the Phil@@ ist@@ ine in his forehead , that the stone sunk into his forehead ; and he fell upon his face to the earth .
and David took the head of the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and brought it to Jerusalem ; but he put his arm@@ our in his tent .
and Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him , and gave it to David , and his garments , even to his sword , and to his bow , and to his gir@@ dle .
therefore Saul removed him from him , and made him his captain over a thousand ; and he went out and came in before the people .
and Saul commanded his servants , saying , Commun@@ e with David secretly , and say , Be@@ hold , the king hath delight in thee , and all his servants love thee : now therefore be the king 's son in law .
and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art , and I will commun@@ e with my father of thee ; and what I see , that I will tell thee .
and Jonathan sp@@ ake good of David unto Saul his father , and said unto him , Let not the king sin against his servant , against David ; because he hath not sin@@ ned against thee , and because his works have been to the@@ ew@@ ard very good :
Saul also sent messengers unto David 's house , to watch him , and to sl@@ ay him in the morning : and Mic@@ h@@ al David 's wife told him , saying , If thou save not thy life to night , to mor@@ row thou shalt be sl@@ ain .
and Saul said unto Mic@@ h@@ al , Why hast thou deceived me so , and sent away mine enemy , that he is escaped ? and Mic@@ h@@ al answered Saul , He said unto me , Let me go ; why should I kill thee ?
and he stripped off his clothes also , and prophe@@ si@@ ed before Samuel in like manner , and lay down naked all that day and all that night . W@@ herefore they say , Is Saul also among the prophets ?
and David fled from Nai@@ o@@ th in Ram@@ ah , and came and said before Jonathan , What have I done ? what is mine ini@@ qu@@ ity ? and what is my sin before thy father , that he see@@ ket@@ h my life ?
then said Jonathan unto David , whatsoever thy soul desi@@ re@@ th , I will even do it for thee .
but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever : no , not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth .
and when the l@@ ad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot , Jonathan cried after the l@@ ad , and said , Is not the arrow beyond thee ?
and as soon as the l@@ ad was gone , David arose out of a place toward the south , and fell on his face to the ground , and bowed himself three times : and they kis@@ sed one another , and we@@ pt one with another , until David exceeded .
and David said unto A@@ him@@ elec@@ h , And is there not here under th@@ ine hand spe@@ ar or sword ? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me , because the king 's business required ha@@ ste .
and David laid up these words in his heart , and was sore afraid of Ach@@ ish the king of G@@ ath .
then said Ach@@ ish unto his servants , L@@ o , ye see the man is mad : W@@ herefore then have ye brought him to me ?
then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him , He@@ ar now , ye Ben@@ jam@@ ites ; will the son of Jes@@ se give every one of you fields and vineyards , and make you all cap@@ tains of thousands , and cap@@ tains of hundreds ;
and they two made a covenant before the LORD : and David ab@@ ode in the wood , and Jonathan went to his house .
so David stayed his servants with these words , and suffered them not to rise against Saul . but Saul rose up out of the cave , and went on his way .
swear now therefore unto me by the LORD , that thou wil@@ t not cut off my seed after me , and that thou wil@@ t not destroy my name out of my father 's house .
and David sw@@ are unto Saul . and Saul went home ; but David and his men G@@ at them up unto the hold .
and there was a man in Ma@@ on , whose possessions were in Car@@ me@@ l ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand sheep , and a thousand goats : and he was sh@@ earing his sheep in Car@@ me@@ l .
and David heard in the wilderness that Nab@@ al did she@@ ar his sheep .
and Nab@@ al answered David 's servants , and said , Who is David ? and who is the son of Jes@@ se ? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master .
and David said unto his men , G@@ ird ye on every man his sword . and they gir@@ ded on every man his sword ; and David also gir@@ ded on his sword : and there went up after David about four hundred men ; and two hundred ab@@ ode by the stuff .
and when Ab@@ ig@@ ail saw David , she ha@@ sted , and lighted off the ass , and fell before David on her face , and bowed herself to the ground ,
I pray thee , forgive the t@@ resp@@ ass of th@@ ine hand@@ maid : for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house ; because my lord fi@@ ght@@ eth the battles of the LORD , and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days .
and blessed be thy advice , and blessed be thou , which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood , and from av@@ eng@@ ing myself with mine own hand .
the LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faith@@ fulness : for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day , but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD 's ano@@ inted .
and , behold , as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes , so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD , and let him deliver me out of all tribu@@ lation .
and David said to Ach@@ ish , Su@@ rely thou shalt know what thy servant can do . and Ach@@ ish said to David , T@@ herefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever .
now the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered together all their armies to Ap@@ he@@ k : and the Israel@@ ites pit@@ ched by a fountain which is in J@@ ez@@ re@@ el .
and David said to A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the priest , A@@ him@@ elec@@ h 's son , I pray thee , bring me hi@@ ther the ep@@ ho@@ d . and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar brought thi@@ ther the ep@@ ho@@ d to David .
and they cut off his head , and stripped off his arm@@ our , and sent into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines round about , to publish it in the house of their idols , and among the people .
then David took hold on his clothes , and rent them ; and likewise all the men that were with him :
therefore now let your hands be strengthened , and be ye val@@ i@@ ant : for your master Saul is dead , and also the house of Jud@@ ah have ano@@ inted me king over them .
and Jo@@ ab said , As God liv@@ eth , unless thou had@@ st spoken , surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother .
and Ab@@ ner sent messengers to David on his behalf , saying , Wh@@ ose is the land ? saying also , Make thy league with me , and , behold , my hand shall be with thee , to bring about all Israel unto thee .
in He@@ br@@ on he re@@ igned over Jud@@ ah seven years and six months : and in Jerusalem he re@@ igned thirty and three years over all Israel and Jud@@ ah .
and when they came to N@@ ach@@ on 's thresh@@ ing@@ floor , Uz@@ z@@ ah put forth his hand to the ark of God , and took hold of it ; for the ox@@ en shook it .
so David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David : but David carried it aside into the house of O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom the G@@ it@@ tite .
and as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David , Mic@@ h@@ al Saul 's daughter looked through a window , and saw king David le@@ aping and dancing before the LORD ; and she desp@@ ised him in her heart .
and David said unto Mic@@ h@@ al , It was before the LORD , which chose me before thy father , and before all his house , to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD , over Israel : therefore will I play before the LORD .
and as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel , and have caused thee to rest from all th@@ ine enemies . also the LORD tell@@ eth thee that he will make thee an house .
and when thy days be fulfilled , and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers , I will set up thy seed after thee , which shall proceed out of thy bow@@ els , and I will establish his kingdom .
but my mercy shall not depart away from him , as I took it from Saul , whom I put away before thee .
W@@ herefore thou art great , O LORD God : for there is none like thee , neither is there any God beside thee , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
now when M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth , the son of Jonathan , the son of Saul , was come unto David , he fell on his face , and did reverence . and David said , M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth . and he answered , Be@@ hold thy servant !
and it came to pass , after the year was expired , at the time when kings go forth to battle , that David sent Jo@@ ab , and his servants with him , and all Israel ; and they destroyed the children of Am@@ mon , and be@@ sieg@@ ed Rab@@ ba@@ h . but David tar@@ ried still at Jerusalem .
and David sent messengers , and took her ; and she came in unto him , and he lay with her ; for she was purified from her un@@ clean@@ ness : and she returned unto her house .
and David said to Uri@@ ah , Go down to thy house , and wash thy feet . and Uri@@ ah departed out of the king 's house , and there followed him a mess of meat from the king .
and when David had called him , he did eat and drink before him ; and he made him drunk : and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord , but went not down to his house .
and the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants ; and some of the king 's servants be dead , and thy servant Uri@@ ah the Hit@@ tite is dead also .
and when the wife of Uri@@ ah heard that Uri@@ ah her husband was dead , she mour@@ ned for her husband .
but when David saw that his servants whispered , David perceived that the child was dead : therefore David said unto his servants , Is the child dead ? and they said , He is dead .
and David comfor@@ ted Bath @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba his wife , and went in unto her , and lay with her : and she bare a son , and he called his name Solomon : and the LORD loved him .
then Am@@ non hated her exceedingly ; so that the hatred where@@ with he hated her was greater than the love where@@ with he had loved her . and Am@@ non said unto her , A@@ rise , be gone .
then he called his servant that minist@@ ered unto him , and said , P@@ ut now this woman out from me , and bolt the door after her .
and Tam@@ ar put ashes on her head , and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her , and laid her hand on her head , and went on crying .
and Ab@@ sal@@ om came to the king , and said , Be@@ hold now , thy servant hath she@@ ep@@ sh@@ ear@@ ers ; let the king , I bes@@ e@@ ech thee , and his servants go with thy servant .
and the servants of Ab@@ sal@@ om did unto Am@@ non as Ab@@ sal@@ om had commanded . then all the king 's sons arose , and every man G@@ at him up upon his mu@@ le , and fled .
but Ab@@ sal@@ om fled , and went to Tal@@ ma@@ i , the son of Am@@ mi@@ hud , king of G@@ es@@ hu@@ r . and David mour@@ ned for his son every day .
and when the woman of Te@@ ko@@ ah sp@@ ake to the king , she fell on her face to the ground , and did obe@@ is@@ ance , and said , Help , O king .
and the king said , Wh@@ oso@@ ever sa@@ ith ought unto thee , bring him to me , and he shall not touch thee any more .
for the king will hear , to deliver his hand@@ maid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God .
and the king said unto Jo@@ ab , Be@@ hold now , I have done this thing : go therefore , bring the young man Ab@@ sal@@ om again .
so Jo@@ ab came to the king , and told him : and when he had called for Ab@@ sal@@ om , he came to the king , and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king kis@@ sed Ab@@ sal@@ om .
and the king went forth , and all his household after him . and the king left ten women , which were conc@@ ub@@ ines , to keep the house .
whereas thou cam@@ est but yesterday , should I this day make thee go up and down with us ? seeing I go whi@@ ther I may , return thou , and take back thy brethren : mercy and truth be with thee .
and David went up by the ascent of mount O@@ liv@@ et , and we@@ pt as he went up , and had his head covered , and he went b@@ are@@ foot : and all the people that was with him covered every man his head , and they went up , we@@ eping as they went up .
the LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul , in whose stead thou hast re@@ igned ; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Ab@@ sal@@ om thy son : and , behold , thou art taken in thy mis@@ chief , because thou art a bloody man .
and David said to Ab@@ is@@ hai , and to all his servants , Be@@ hold , my son , which came forth of my bow@@ els , see@@ ket@@ h my life : how much more now may this Ben@@ jam@@ ite do it ? let him alone , and let him curse ; for the LORD hath bid@@ den him .
and when A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el saw that his counsel was not followed , he sadd@@ led his ass , and arose , and G@@ at him home to his house , to his city , and put his household in order , and han@@ ged himself , and died , and was buried in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of his father .
and there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Zi@@ ba the servant of the house of Saul , and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went over Jordan before the king .
for all of my father 's house were but dead men before my lord the king : yet did@@ st thou set thy servant among them that did eat at th@@ ine own table . what right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king ?
and the king answered , Ch@@ im@@ ham shall go over with me , and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee : and whatsoever thou shalt require of me , that will I do for thee .
and all the people went over Jordan . and when the king was come over , the king kis@@ sed Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i , and blessed him ; and he returned unto his own place .
the LORD thunder@@ ed from heaven , and the most High uttered his voice .
the LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness : according to the clean@@ ness of my hands hath he re@@ comp@@ en@@ sed me .
therefore the LORD hath re@@ comp@@ en@@ sed me according to my righteousness ; according to my clean@@ ness in his eye sight .
therefore I will give thanks unto thee , O LORD , among the he@@ a@@ then , and I will sing pra@@ ises unto thy name .
and Ab@@ is@@ hai , the brother of Jo@@ ab , the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , was chief among three . and he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred , and sle@@ w them , and had the name among three .
go and say unto David , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , I offer thee three things ; choose thee one of them , that I may do it unto thee .
and Ad@@ oni@@ jah sle@@ w sheep and ox@@ en and fat cattle by the stone of Zo@@ hel@@ eth , which is by E@@ n @@@ -@@ @ rog@@ el , and called all his brethren the king 's sons , and all the men of Jud@@ ah the king 's servants :
but Na@@ than the prophet , and Ben@@ aiah , and the mighty men , and Solomon his brother , he called not .
go and get thee in unto king David , and say unto him , did@@ st not thou , my lord , O king , swear unto th@@ ine hand@@ maid , saying , As@@ su@@ re@@ dly Solomon thy son shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne ? why then do@@ th Ad@@ oni@@ jah reign ?
and moreover the king 's servants came to bless our lord king David , saying , God make the name of Solomon better than thy name , and make his throne greater than thy throne . and the king bowed himself upon the bed .
so king Solomon sent , and they brought him down from the altar . and he came and bowed himself to king Solomon : and Solomon said unto him , Go to th@@ ine house .
so David slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of David .
so Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada went up , and fell upon him , and sle@@ w him : and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness .
and Shim@@ ei arose , and sadd@@ led his ass , and went to G@@ ath to Ach@@ ish to seek his servants : and Shim@@ ei went , and brought his servants from G@@ ath .
the king said moreover to Shim@@ ei , Th@@ ou know@@ est all the w@@ ick@@ edness which th@@ ine heart is priv@@ y to , that thou did@@ st to David my father : therefore the LORD shall return thy w@@ ick@@ edness upon th@@ ine own head ;
give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people , that I may discern between good and bad : for who is able to judge this thy so great a people ?
and God said unto him , Because thou hast asked this thing , and hast not asked for thy@@ self long life ; neither hast asked riches for thy@@ self , nor hast asked the life of th@@ ine enemies ; but hast asked for thy@@ self understanding to discern judgment ;
behold , I have done according to thy words : lo , I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart ; so that there was none like thee before thee , neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee .
and I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked , both riches , and honour : so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days .
and she arose at midnight , and took my son from beside me , while th@@ ine hand@@ maid slept , and laid it in her bos@@ om , and laid her dead child in my bos@@ om .
and Jud@@ ah and Israel d@@ wel@@ t safely , every man under his vine and under his fi@@ g tree , from Dan even to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba , all the days of Solomon .
and Hir@@ am king of Ty@@ re sent his servants unto Solomon ; for he had heard that they had ano@@ inted him king in the room of his father : for Hir@@ am was ever a lover of David .
thou know@@ est how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side , until the LORD put them under the sol@@ es of his feet .
and , behold , I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God , as the LORD sp@@ ake unto David my father , saying , Th@@ y son , whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room , he shall build an house unto my name .
and he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month by courses : a month they were in Lebanon , and two months at home : and Ad@@ on@@ ir@@ am was over the lev@@ y .
but Solomon was building his own house thirteen years , and he finished all his house .
and his house where he d@@ wel@@ t had another court within the por@@ ch , which was of the like work . Solomon made also an house for Phar@@ aoh 's daughter , whom he had taken to wife , like unto this por@@ ch .
for he cast two pillars of brass , of eighteen cub@@ its high api@@ ece : and a line of twelve cub@@ its did compass either of them about .
and Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heaven :
and he said , LORD God of Israel , there is no God like thee , in heaven above , or on earth beneath , who keep@@ est covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart :
and hear@@ ken thou to the suppl@@ ication of thy servant , and of thy people Israel , when they shall pray toward this place : and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place : and when thou he@@ arest , forgive .
then hear thou in heaven , and do , and judge thy servants , condemning the wicked , to bring his way upon his head ; and justi@@ fying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
when heaven is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sin@@ ned against thee ; if they pray toward this place , and confess thy name , and turn from their sin , when thou afflic@@ test them :
if thy people go out to battle against their enemy , whi@@ ther@@ soever thou shalt send them , and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen , and toward the house that I have built for thy name :
for thou did@@ st separate them from among all the people of the earth , to be th@@ ine inheritance , as thou sp@@ ak@@ est by the hand of Moses thy servant , when thou br@@ ough@@ test our fathers out of Egypt , O Lord GO@@ D .
that he may incl@@ ine our hearts unto him , to walk in all his ways , and to keep his commandments , and his statutes , and his judgments , which he commanded our fathers .
on the eighth day he sent the people away : and they blessed the king , and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant , and for Israel his people .
then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have hal@@ lowed for my name , will I cast out of my sight ; and Israel shall be a prover@@ b and a by@@ word among all people :
for Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Ge@@ zer , and burnt it with fire , and sl@@ ain the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites that d@@ wel@@ t in the city , and given it for a present unto his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
and Hir@@ am sent in the navy his servants , ship@@ men that had knowledge of the sea , with the servants of Solomon .
and she said to the king , It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom .
happy are thy men , happy are these thy servants , which stand continually before thee , and that hear thy wisdom .
and they brought every man his present , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and garments , and arm@@ our , and spices , horses , and mul@@ es , a rate year by year .
and likewise did he for all his strange wives , which burnt inc@@ ense and sacrificed unto their gods .
and the LORD was angry with Solomon , because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel , which had appeared unto him twice ,
W@@ herefore the LORD said unto Solomon , for@@ as@@ much as this is done of thee , and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes , which I have commanded thee , I will surely ren@@ d the kingdom from thee , and will give it to thy servant .
and when had@@ ad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers , and that Jo@@ ab the captain of the host was dead , had@@ ad said to Phar@@ aoh , Let me depart , that I may go to mine own country .
and he gathered men unto him , and became captain over a band , when David sle@@ w them of Z@@ ob@@ ah : and they went to Damascus , and d@@ wel@@ t therein , and re@@ igned in Damascus .
and unto his son will I give one tribe , that David my servant may have a light al@@ way before me in Jerusalem , the city which I have chosen me to put my name there .
and Solomon slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of David his father : and Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am his son re@@ igned in his stead .
and J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am said in his heart , Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David :
now there d@@ wel@@ t an old prophet in Be@@ the@@ l ; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Be@@ the@@ l : the words which he had spoken unto the king , them they told also to their father .
but cam@@ est back , and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place , of the which the LORD did say to thee , E@@ at no bread , and drink no water ; thy car@@ case shall not come unto the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of thy fathers .
and take with thee ten lo@@ aves , and crack@@ nels , and a cr@@ use of honey , and go to him : he shall tell thee what shall become of the child .
and rent the kingdom away from the house of David , and gave it thee : and yet thou hast not been as my servant David , who kept my commandments , and who followed me with all his heart , to do that only which was right in mine eyes ;
but hast done evil above all that were before thee : for thou hast gone and made thee other gods , and mol@@ ten images , to provoke me to anger , and hast cast me behind thy back :
and Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David . and his mother 's name was Na@@ am@@ ah an Am@@ monit@@ ess . and A@@ bi@@ jam his son re@@ igned in his stead .
and he walked in all the sins of his father , which he had done before him : and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God , as the heart of David his father .
so Ben @@@ -@@ @ had@@ ad hear@@ k@@ ened unto king As@@ a , and sent the cap@@ tains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel , and smo@@ te I@@ j@@ on , and Dan , and A@@ bel @@@ -@@ @ B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ ma@@ acha@@ h , and all Cin@@ ner@@ o@@ th , with all the land of N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i .
and he did evil in the sight of the LORD , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin where@@ with he made Israel to sin .
and the woman said to Elijah , Now by this I know that thou art a man of God , and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth .
and as Ob@@ adi@@ ah was in the way , behold , Elijah met him : and he knew him , and fell on his face , and said , Art thou that my lord Elijah ?
and Elijah said unto the prophets of Ba@@ al , Choose you one bul@@ lock for yourselves , and dress it first ; for ye are many ; and call on the name of your gods , but put no fire under .
so A@@ hab went up to eat and to drink . and Elijah went up to the top of Car@@ me@@ l ; and he cast himself down upon the earth , and put his face between his knees ,
and when he saw that , he arose , and went for his life , and came to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba , which belong@@ eth to Jud@@ ah , and left his servant there .
and Je@@ hu the son of N@@ im@@ sh@@ i shalt thou ano@@ int to be king over Israel : and Elis@@ ha the son of Sha@@ ph@@ at of A@@ bel @@@ -@@ @ me@@ hol@@ ah shalt thou ano@@ int to be prophet in thy room .
and the messengers came again , and said , Th@@ us spe@@ ak@@ eth Ben @@@ -@@ @ had@@ ad , saying , Although I have sent unto thee , saying , Th@@ ou shalt deliver me thy silver , and thy gold , and thy wives , and thy children ;
behold , I will bring evil upon thee , and will take away thy post@@ er@@ ity , and will cut off from A@@ hab him that p@@ is@@ set@@ h against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in Israel ,
and will make th@@ ine house like the house of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , and like the house of Ba@@ asha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah , for the provocation where@@ with thou hast provoked me to anger , and made Israel to sin .
and the king of Israel said unto his servants , Know ye that Ram@@ o@@ th in Gil@@ e@@ ad is ours , and we be still , and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria ?
now therefore , behold , the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets , and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee .
and the king of Israel said unto Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , I will disguise myself , and enter into the battle ; but put thou on thy robes . and the king of Israel disguised himself , and went into the battle .
and A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah fell down through a lat@@ tice in his upper chamber that was in Sam@@ aria , and was sick : and he sent messengers , and said unto them , Go , inqu@@ ire of Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ ze@@ bu@@ b the god of Ek@@ ron whether I shall recover of this disease .
and they answered him , He was an hair@@ y man , and gir@@ t with a gir@@ dle of leather about his lo@@ ins . and he said , It is Elijah the T@@ ish@@ bite .
behold , there came fire down from heaven , and burnt up the two cap@@ tains of the former fif@@ ties with their fif@@ ties : therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight .
and Elijah took his mantle , and wrapped it together , and smo@@ te the waters , and they were divided hi@@ ther and thi@@ ther , so that they two went over on dry ground .
and Elis@@ ha saw it , and he cried , My father , my father , the ch@@ ari@@ ot of Israel , and the hor@@ sem@@ en thereof . and he saw him no more : and he took hold of his own clothes , and rent them in two pieces .
and they said , This is blood : the kings are surely sl@@ ain , and they have sm@@ it@@ ten one another : now therefore , Mo@@ ab , to the spoil .
and when the king of Mo@@ ab saw that the battle was too sore for him , he took with him seven hundred men that drew s@@ words , to break through even unto the king of E@@ dom : but they could not .
then he said , Go , borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours , even empty vessels ; borrow not a few .
so she went from him , and shut the door upon her and upon her sons , who brought the vessels to her ; and she poured out .
and she said unto her husband , Be@@ hold now , I perceive that this is an holy man of God , which pass@@ eth by us continually .
then she said , Did I desire a son of my lord ? did I not say , Do not deceive me ?
he went in therefore , and shut the door upon them tw@@ ain , and prayed unto the LORD .
then she went in , and fell at his feet , and bowed herself to the ground , and took up her son , and went out .
and one went out into the field to gather herbs , and found a wild vine , and gathered thereof wild gour@@ ds his lap full , and came and sh@@ red them into the pot of pot@@ tage : for they knew them not .
and she said unto her mistress , W@@ ould God my lord were with the prophet that is in Sam@@ aria ! for he would recover him of his le@@ pro@@ sy .
and one went in , and told his lord , saying , Th@@ us and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel .
and the king of Syria said , Go to , go , and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel . and he departed , and took with him ten talents of silver , and six thousand pieces of gold , and ten changes of ra@@ iment .
and it was so , when Elis@@ ha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes , that he sent to the king , saying , W@@ herefore hast thou rent thy clothes ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel .
and Elis@@ ha sent a messenger unto him , saying , Go and wash in the Jordan seven times , and thy flesh shall come again to thee , and thou shalt be clean .
but Na@@ aman was w@@ ro@@ th , and went away , and said , Be@@ hold , I thought , He will surely come out to me , and stand , and call on the name of the LORD his God , and strike his hand over the place , and recover the le@@ per .
so Ge@@ haz@@ i followed after Na@@ aman . and when Na@@ aman saw him running after him , he lighted down from the ch@@ ari@@ ot to meet him , and said , Is all well ?
but he went in , and stood before his master . and Elis@@ ha said unto him , wh@@ ence com@@ est thou , Ge@@ haz@@ i ? and he said , Th@@ y servant went no whi@@ ther .
therefore said he , Take it up to thee . and he put out his hand , and took it .
therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing ; and he called his servants , and said unto them , Will ye not sh@@ ew me which of us is for the king of Israel ?
W@@ herefore they arose and fled in the tw@@ ilight , and left their tents , and their horses , and their asses , even the camp as it was , and fled for their life .
and they went after them unto Jordan : and , lo , all the way was full of garments and vessels , which the Syrians had cast away in their ha@@ ste . and the messengers returned , and told the king .
so Jor@@ am went over to Z@@ air , and all the ch@@ ari@@ ots with him : and he rose by night , and smo@@ te the E@@ dom@@ ites which comp@@ assed him about , and the cap@@ tains of the ch@@ ari@@ ots : and the people fled into their tents .
and Jor@@ am slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David : and A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah his son re@@ igned in his stead .
and Elis@@ ha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets , and said unto him , G@@ ird up thy lo@@ ins , and take this box of oil in th@@ ine hand , and go to Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ Gil@@ e@@ ad :
and when he came , behold , the cap@@ tains of the host were sitting ; and he said , I have an err@@ and to thee , O captain . and Je@@ hu said , Un@@ to which of all us ? and he said , To thee , O captain .
and Je@@ hu drew a bow with his full strength , and smo@@ te Je@@ hor@@ am between his arms , and the arrow went out at his heart , and he sunk down in his ch@@ ari@@ ot .
and when Je@@ hu was come to J@@ ez@@ re@@ el , J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel heard of it ; and she painted her face , and tired her head , and looked out at a window .
and he lifted up his face to the window , and said , Who is on my side ? who ? and there looked out to him two or three e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s .
look even out the best and me@@ et@@ est of your master 's sons , and set him on his father 's throne , and fight for your master 's house .
and the seventh year Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds , with the cap@@ tains and the guard , and brought them to him into the house of the LORD , and made a covenant with them , and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD , and sh@@ ew@@ ed them the king 's son .
and the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , round about the king , from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple , along by the altar and the temple .
and Je@@ ho@@ ash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all his days where@@ in Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the priest instructed him .
then king Je@@ ho@@ ash called for Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the priest , and the other priests , and said unto them , Why repair ye not the breaches of the house ? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance , but deliver it for the breaches of the house .
( and the LORD gave Israel a s@@ avi@@ our , so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians : and the children of Israel d@@ wel@@ t in their tents , as be@@ fore@@ time .
and he said to the king of Israel , P@@ ut th@@ ine hand upon the bow . and he put his hand upon it : and Elis@@ ha put his hands upon the king 's hands .
and the LORD was gr@@ acious unto them , and had compassion on them , and had respect unto them , because of his covenant with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and would not destroy them , neither cast he them from his presence as yet .
thou hast indeed sm@@ it@@ ten E@@ dom , and th@@ ine heart hath lifted thee up : glory of this , and tar@@ ry at home : for why shoul@@ dest thou med@@ dle to thy hurt , that thou shoul@@ dest fall , even thou , and Jud@@ ah with thee ?
he built El@@ ath , and restored it to Jud@@ ah , after that the king slept with his fathers .
and J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am slept with his fathers , even with the kings of Israel ; and Z@@ ach@@ ari@@ ah his son re@@ igned in his stead .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD : he departed not all his days from the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , who made Israel to sin .
but Pe@@ k@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah , a captain of his , con@@ spi@@ red against him , and smo@@ te him in Sam@@ aria , in the palace of the king 's house , with Ar@@ go@@ b and Ari@@ eh , and with him fifty men of the Gil@@ e@@ ad@@ ites : and he killed him , and re@@ igned in his room .
and Jo@@ th@@ am slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father : and A@@ haz his son re@@ igned in his stead .
and he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering , and poured his drink offering , and sprink@@ led the blood of his peace offerings , upon the altar .
for so it was , that the children of Israel had sin@@ ned against the LORD their God , which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt , from under the hand of Phar@@ o@@ ah king of Egypt , and had feared other gods ,
and they set them up images and gro@@ ves in every high hill , and under every green tree :
notwithstanding they would not hear , but hardened their nec@@ ks , like to the neck of their fathers , that did not believe in the LORD their God .
and they left all the commandments of the LORD their God , and made them mol@@ ten images , even two cal@@ ves , and made a gro@@ ve , and wor@@ shipped all the host of heaven , and served Ba@@ al .
and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire , and used div@@ ination and enchan@@ tments , and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD , to provoke him to anger .
therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel , and removed them out of his sight : there was none left but the tribe of Jud@@ ah only .
until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight , as he had said by all his servants the prophets . so was Israel carried away out of their own land to As@@ sy@@ ria unto this day .
and the Av@@ ites made Ni@@ b@@ haz and Tar@@ ta@@ k , and the Sep@@ harv@@ ites burnt their children in fire to A@@ dram@@ m@@ elec@@ h and An@@ amm@@ elec@@ h , the gods of Sep@@ harv@@ aim .
so they feared the LORD , and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places , which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places .
then said Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of Hil@@ ki@@ ah , and She@@ b@@ na , and Jo@@ ah , unto R@@ ab @@@ -@@ @ sha@@ ke@@ h , Spe@@ ak , I pray thee , to thy servants in the Syrian language ; for we understand it : and talk not with us in the Jews ' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall .
hear@@ ken not to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah : for thus sa@@ ith the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , Make an agreement with me by a present , and come out to me , and then eat ye every man of his own vine , and every one of his fi@@ g tree , and drink ye every one the waters of his ci@@ stern :
who are they among all the gods of the countries , that have delivered their country out of mine hand , that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand ?
for I will defend this city , to save it , for mine own sake , and for my servant David 's sake .
then he turned his face to the wall , and prayed unto the LORD , saying ,
turn again , and tell He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah the captain of my people , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , the God of David thy father , I have heard thy prayer , I have seen thy tears : behold , I will heal thee : on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD .
and I will add unto thy days fifteen years ; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria ; and I will defend this city for mine own sake , and for my servant David 's sake .
and he said , What have they seen in th@@ ine house ? and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah answered , All the things that are in mine house have they seen : there is nothing among my treasures that I have not sh@@ ew@@ ed them .
and of thy sons that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt be@@ get , shall they take away ; and they shall be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s in the palace of the king of Babylon .
and he made his son pass through the fire , and observed times , and used enchan@@ tments , and dealt with familiar spirits and w@@ izards : he wrought much w@@ ick@@ edness in the sight of the LORD , to provoke him to anger .
because Man@@ as@@ se@@ h king of Jud@@ ah hath done these ab@@ om@@ inations , and hath done w@@ ick@@ edly above all that the A@@ mor@@ ites did , which were before him , and hath made Jud@@ ah also to sin with his idols :
and he de@@ filed T@@ oph@@ eth , which is in the valley of the children of H@@ inno@@ m , that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Mol@@ ech .
for through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Jud@@ ah , until he had cast them out from his presence , that Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah reb@@ elled against the king of Babylon .
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon came , he , and all his host , against Jerusalem , and pit@@ ched against it ; and they built for@@ ts against it round about .
and they trans@@ g@@ ressed against the God of their fathers , and went a wh@@ oring after the gods of the people of the land , whom God destroyed before them .
so all Israel were reck@@ oned by gene@@ alo@@ gies ; and , behold , they were written in the book of the kings of Israel and Jud@@ ah , who were carried away to Babylon for their trans@@ g@@ ression .
now the first inhabitants that d@@ wel@@ t in their possessions in their cities were , the Israel@@ ites , the priests , Lev@@ ites , and the Ne@@ thin@@ ims .
and their brethren , which were in their villages , were to come after seven days from time to time with them .
and these are the singers , chief of the fathers of the Lev@@ ites , who remaining in the chambers were free : for they were employed in that work day and night .
then said Saul to his arm@@ our@@ be@@ arer , D@@ raw thy sword , and thrust me through there@@ with ; lest these un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised come and abuse me . but his arm@@ our@@ be@@ arer would not ; for he was sore afraid . so Saul took a sword , and fell upon it .
and when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , then they for@@ s@@ ook their cities , and fled : and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came and d@@ wel@@ t in them .
and Ab@@ is@@ hai the brother of Jo@@ ab , he was chief of the three : for lifting up his spe@@ ar against three hundred , he sle@@ w them , and had a name among the three .
and let us bring again the ark of our God to us : for we inqui@@ red not at it in the days of Saul .
and when they came unto the thresh@@ ing@@ floor of Chi@@ don , Uz@@ za put forth his hand to hold the ark ; for the ox@@ en stum@@ bled .
and the anger of the LORD was kind@@ led against Uz@@ za , and he smo@@ te him , because he put his hand to the ark : and there he died before God .
so they came up to Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ per@@ az@@ im ; and David smo@@ te them there . then David said , God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters : therefore they called the name of that place Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ per@@ az@@ im .
and when they had left their gods there , David gave a commandment , and they were burned with fire .
and it came to pass , as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David , that Mic@@ h@@ al the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing : and she desp@@ ised him in her heart .
saying , Touch not mine ano@@ inted , and do my prophets no harm .
and it shall come to pass , when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers , that I will raise up thy seed after thee , which shall be of thy sons ; and I will establish his kingdom .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son : and I will not take my mercy away from him , as I took it from him that was before thee :
O LORD , for thy servant 's sake , and according to th@@ ine own heart , hast thou done all this greatness , in making known all these great things .
O LORD , there is none like thee , neither is there any God beside thee , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
and David smo@@ te Had@@ are@@ zer king of Z@@ ob@@ ah unto Ham@@ ath , as he went to st@@ ablis@@ h his dom@@ inion by the river E@@ uph@@ rates .
so G@@ ad came to David , and said unto him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , Choose thee
and David lifted up his eyes , and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven , having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem . then David and the elders of Israel , who were clo@@ thed in s@@ ack@@ cloth , fell upon their faces .
and Ele@@ az@@ ar died , and had no sons , but daughters : and their brethren the sons of K@@ ish took them .
and of all my sons , ( for the LORD hath given me many sons , ) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel .
th@@ ine , O LORD , is the greatness , and the power , and the glory , and the victory , and the maj@@ esty : for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is th@@ ine ; th@@ ine is the kingdom , O LORD , and thou art exalted as head above all .
but who am I , and what is my people , that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort ? for all things come of thee , and of th@@ ine own have we given thee .
O LORD our God , all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for th@@ ine holy name com@@ eth of th@@ ine hand , and is all th@@ ine own .
and give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep thy commandments , thy testim@@ onies , and thy statutes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for the which I have made provision .
and David said to all the congregation , Now bless the LORD your God . and all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers , and bowed down their heads , and wor@@ shipped the LORD , and the king .
wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee ; and I will give thee riches , and wealth , and honour , such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee , neither shall there any after thee have the like .
then Hur@@ am the king of Ty@@ re answered in writing , which he sent to Solomon , Because the LORD hath loved his people , he hath made thee king over them .
Hur@@ am said moreover , Bless@@ ed be the LORD God of Israel , that made heaven and earth , who hath given to David the king a wise son , endu@@ ed with prudence and understanding , that might build an house for the LORD , and an house for his kingdom .
now therefore the wheat , and the barley , the oil , and the wine , which my lord hath spoken of , let him send unto his servants :
the wings of these cher@@ ub@@ ims spread themselves forth twenty cub@@ its : and they stood on their feet , and their faces were inward .
and the king turned his face , and blessed the whole congregation of Israel : and all the congregation of Israel stood .
but the LORD said to David my father , for@@ as@@ much as it was in th@@ ine heart to build an house for my name , thou did@@ st well in that it was in th@@ ine heart :
for Solomon had made a br@@ as@@ en sc@@ aff@@ old , of five cub@@ its long , and five cub@@ its broad , and three cub@@ its high , and had set it in the midst of the court : and upon it he stood , and kne@@ eled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heaven ,
and said , O LORD God of Israel , there is no God like thee in the heaven , nor in the earth ; which keep@@ est covenant , and sh@@ ew@@ est mercy unto thy servants , that walk before thee with all their hearts :
when the heaven is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sin@@ ned against thee ; yet if they pray toward this place , and confess thy name , and turn from their sin , when thou d@@ ost aff@@ l@@ ict them ;
moreover concerning the stranger , which is not of thy people Israel , but is come from a far country for thy great name 's sake , and thy mighty hand , and thy stretched out arm ; if they come and pray in this house ;
if thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them , and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen , and the house which I have built for thy name ;
then hear thou from the heavens , even from thy dwelling place , their prayer and their suppl@@ ications , and maintain their cause , and forgive thy people which have sin@@ ned against thee .
now mine eyes shall be open , and mine ears att@@ ent unto the prayer that is made in this place .
and as for thee , if thou wil@@ t walk before me , as David thy father walked , and do according to all that I have commanded thee , and shalt observe my statues and my judgments ;
then will I pl@@ uck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have sancti@@ fied for my name , will I cast out of my sight , and will make it to be a prover@@ b and a by@@ word among all nations .
and the meat of his table , and the sitting of his servants , and the attendance of his ministers , and their app@@ arel ; his cu@@ p@@ bearers also , and their app@@ arel ; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD ; there was no more spirit in her .
and she said to the king , It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of th@@ ine acts , and of thy wisdom :
happy are thy men , and happy are these thy servants , which stand continually before thee , and hear thy wisdom .
and king Solomon gave to the queen of She@@ ba all her desire , whatsoever she asked , beside that which she had brought unto the king . so she turned , and went away to her own land , she and her servants .
and they brought every man his present , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and ra@@ iment , harness , and spices , horses , and mul@@ es , a rate year by year .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Y@@ e shall not go up , nor fight against your brethren : return every man to his house : for this thing is done of me . and they obeyed the words of the LORD , and returned from going against J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am .
for the Lev@@ ites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem : for J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest 's office unto the LORD :
and Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am loved Ma@@ acha@@ h the daughter of Ab@@ sal@@ om above all his wives and his conc@@ ub@@ ines : ( for he took eighteen wives , and thre@@ es@@ core conc@@ ub@@ ines ; and beg@@ at twenty and eight sons , and thre@@ es@@ core daughters . )
and he did evil , because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD .
thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time , and the children of Jud@@ ah prevailed , because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers .
and commanded Jud@@ ah to seek the LORD God of their fathers , and to do the law and the commandment .
but when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel , and sought him , he was found of them .
and they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul ;
were not the Ethiop@@ ians and the Lub@@ ims a huge host , with very many ch@@ ari@@ ots and hor@@ sem@@ en ? yet , because thou did@@ st rely on the LORD , he delivered them into th@@ ine hand .
but sought to the LORD God of his father , and walked in his commandments , and not after the do@@ ings of Israel .
then he said , I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains , as sheep that have no shepherd : and the LORD said , These have no master ; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace .
now therefore , behold , the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets , and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee .
and the king of Israel said unto Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , I will disguise myself , and will go to the battle ; but put thou on thy robes . so the king of Israel disguised himself ; and they went to the battle .
and a certain man drew a bow at a venture , and smo@@ te the king of Israel between the joints of the harness : therefore he said to his ch@@ ari@@ ot man , Turn th@@ ine hand , that thou may@@ est carry me out of the host ; for I am wounded .
and Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Jud@@ ah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem .
nevertheless there are good things found in thee , in that thou hast taken away the gro@@ ves out of the land , and hast prepared th@@ ine heart to seek God .
How@@ be@@ it the high places were not taken away : for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers .
now Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David . and Je@@ hor@@ am his son re@@ igned in his stead .
so the E@@ dom@@ ites revol@@ ted from under the hand of Jud@@ ah unto this day . the same time also did Lib@@ n@@ ah revolt from under his hand ; because he had for@@ s@@ aken the LORD God of his fathers .
behold , with a great plague will the LORD sm@@ ite thy people , and thy children , and thy wives , and all thy goods :
and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada made a covenant between him , and between all the people , and between the king , that they should be the LORD 's people .
and they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers , and served gro@@ ves and idols : and wrath came upon Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem for this their t@@ resp@@ ass .
now it came to pass , when the kingdom was established to him , that he sle@@ w his servants that had killed the king his father .
W@@ herefore the anger of the LORD was kind@@ led against Ama@@ zi@@ ah , and he sent unto him a prophet , which said unto him , Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people , which could not deliver their own people out of th@@ ine hand ?
but when he was strong , his heart was lifted up to his destruction : for he trans@@ g@@ ressed against the LORD his God , and went into the temple of the LORD to burn inc@@ ense upon the altar of inc@@ ense .
moreover he burnt inc@@ ense in the valley of the son of H@@ inno@@ m , and burnt his children in the fire , after the ab@@ om@@ inations of the he@@ a@@ then whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel .
for Pe@@ k@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah sle@@ w in Jud@@ ah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day , which were all val@@ i@@ ant men ; because they had for@@ s@@ aken the LORD God of their fathers .
and the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand , women , sons , and daughters , and took also away much spoil from them , and brought the spoil to Sam@@ aria .
and now ye purpose to keep under the children of Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem for bond@@ men and bond@@ women unto you : but are there not with you , even with you , sins against the LORD your God ?
and in the time of his distress did he t@@ resp@@ ass yet more against the LORD : this is that king A@@ haz .
and they stood in their place after their manner , according to the law of Moses the man of God : the priests sprink@@ led the blood , which they received of the hand of the Lev@@ ites .
and in every work that he began in the service of the house of God , and in the law , and in the commandments , to seek his God , he did it with all his heart , and prosper@@ ed .
after these things , and the establishment thereof , Sen@@ n@@ ach@@ eri@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ria came , and entered into Jud@@ ah , and enc@@ amped against the f@@ enced cities , and thought to win them for himself .
he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the foun@@ tains which were without the city : and they did help him .
and he set cap@@ tains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city , and sp@@ ake comfortably to them , saying ,
know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands ? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand ?
who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of mine hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand ?
notwithstanding He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah hum@@ bled himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah .
and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah had exceeding much riches and honour : and he made himself treas@@ uries for silver , and for gold , and for precious stones , and for spices , and for shi@@ elds , and for all manner of pleasant jew@@ els ;
this same He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah also stopped the upper water@@ course of Gi@@ hon , and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David . and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah prosper@@ ed in all his works .
and when he was in afflic@@ tion , he bes@@ ought the LORD his God , and hum@@ bled himself greatly before the God of his fathers ,
nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places , yet unto the LORD their God only .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , and walked in the ways of David his father , and declined neither to the right hand , nor to the left .
behold , I will gather thee to thy fathers , and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace , neither shall th@@ ine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place , and upon the inhabitants of the same . so they brought the king word again .
so the service was prepared , and the priests stood in their place , and the Lev@@ ites in their courses , according to the king 's commandment .
and afterward they made ready for themselves , and for the priests : because the priests the sons of Aaron were busi@@ ed in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night ; therefore the Lev@@ ites prepared for themselves , and for the priests the sons of Aaron .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned eleven years in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God .
and he also reb@@ elled against king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar , who had made him swear by God : but he sti@@ ff@@ ened his neck , and hardened his heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel .
all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred . all these did Sh@@ esh@@ b@@ azz@@ ar bring up with them of the cap@@ tivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem .
and these were they which went up from Tel @@@ -@@ @ mel@@ ah , Tel @@@ -@@ @ har@@ sa , cher@@ u@@ b , Ad@@ dan , and Im@@ mer : but they could not sh@@ ew their father 's house , and their seed , whether they were of Israel :
so the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , and some of the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the Ne@@ thin@@ ims , d@@ wel@@ t in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
for the priests and the Lev@@ ites were purified together , all of them were pure , and killed the pas@@ sover for all the children of the cap@@ tivity , and for their brethren the priests , and for themselves .
for E@@ z@@ ra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD , and to do it , and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments .
then I proclaimed a fast there , at the river of A@@ ha@@ va , that we might aff@@ l@@ ict ourselves before our God , to seek of him a right way for us , and for our little ones , and for all our substance .
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves , and for their sons : so that the holy seed have ming@@ led themselves with the people of those lands : ye@@ a , the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this t@@ resp@@ ass .
and at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heav@@ iness ; and having rent my garment and my mantle , I fell upon my knees , and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God .
and said , O my God , I am ashamed and bl@@ ush to lift up my face to thee , my God : for our ini@@ qu@@ ities are increased over our head , and our t@@ resp@@ ass is grown up unto the heavens .
should we again break thy commandments , and join in aff@@ inity with the people of these ab@@ om@@ inations ? w@@ oul@@ dest not thou be angry with us till thou had@@ st consumed us , so that there should be no remn@@ ant nor escaping ?
and they gave their hands that they would put away their wives ; and being guilty , they offered a ram of the flock for their t@@ resp@@ ass .
all these had taken strange wives : and some of them had wives by whom they had children .
that Han@@ ani , one of my brethren , came , he and certain men of Jud@@ ah ; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped , which were left of the cap@@ tivity , and concerning Jerusalem .
and said , I bes@@ e@@ ech thee , O LORD God of heaven , the great and terrible God , that keep@@ eth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments :
and said unto the king , Let the king live for ever : why should not my coun@@ tenance be sad , when the city , the place of my fathers ' se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res , li@@ eth waste , and the gates thereof are consumed with fire ?
then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me ; as also the king 's words that he had spoken unto me . and they said , Let us rise up and build . so they strengthened their hands for this good work .
and next unto them the Te@@ ko@@ ites repaired ; but their no@@ bles put not their nec@@ ks to the work of their Lord .
for the builders , every one had his sword gir@@ ded by his side , and so buil@@ ded . and he that sounded the trum@@ pet was by me .
likewise at the same time said I unto the people , Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem , that in the night they may be a guard to us , and labour on the day .
some also there were that said , We have mortg@@ aged our lands , vineyards , and houses , that we might buy corn , because of the de@@ ar@@ th .
and it came to pass , that when all our enemies heard thereof , and all the he@@ a@@ then that were about us saw these things , they were much cast down in their own eyes : for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God .
for there were many in Jud@@ ah sworn unto him , because he was the son in law of Sh@@ echan@@ i@@ ah the son of Ara@@ h ; and his son Johan@@ an had taken the daughter of M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lam the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah .
and E@@ z@@ ra blessed the LORD , the great God . and all the people answered , A@@ men , A@@ men , with lifting up their hands : and they bowed their heads , and wor@@ shipped the LORD with their faces to the ground .
so the people went forth , and brought them , and made themselves boo@@ ths , every one upon the roof of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of the house of God , and in the street of the water gate , and in the street of the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
and the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers , and stood and confessed their sins , and the ini@@ qu@@ ities of their fathers .
thou g@@ av@@ est also thy good spirit to instruct them , and with@@ hel@@ dest not thy man@@ na from their mouth , and g@@ av@@ est them water for their thirst .
nevertheless they were dis@@ obedient , and reb@@ elled against thee , and cast thy law behind their backs , and sle@@ w thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee , and they wrought great provocations .
and that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land , nor take their daughters for our sons :
also we made ordin@@ ances for us , to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a she@@ kel for the service of the house of our God ;
now these are the chief of the province that d@@ wel@@ t in Jerusalem : but in the cities of Jud@@ ah d@@ wel@@ t every one in his possession in their cities , to w@@ it , Israel , the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , and the Ne@@ thin@@ ims , and the children of Solomon 's servants .
and of the Lev@@ ites were divisions in Jud@@ ah , and in Benjamin .
remember me , O my God , concerning this , and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God , and for the offices thereof .
and one of the sons of Jo@@ i@@ ada , the son of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the high priest , was son in law to San@@ ball@@ at the Hor@@ on@@ ite : therefore I ch@@ ased him from me .
that in those days , when the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us sat on the throne of his kingdom , which was in Sh@@ ush@@ an the palace ,
in the third year of his reign , he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants ; the power of Persia and Media , the no@@ bles and princes of the provinces , being before him :
when he sh@@ ew@@ ed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent maj@@ esty many days , even an hundred and four@@ score days .
and when these days were expired , the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Sh@@ ush@@ an the palace , both unto great and small , seven days , in the court of the garden of the king 's palace ;
for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women , so that they shall desp@@ ise their husbands in their eyes , when it shall be reported , The king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us commanded V@@ ash@@ ti the queen to be brought in before him , but she came not .
and when the king 's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire , ( for it is great , ) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour , both to great and small .
Es@@ ther had not yet sh@@ ew@@ ed her kind@@ red nor her people ; as Mor@@ dec@@ ai had charged her : for Es@@ ther did the commandment of Mor@@ dec@@ ai , like as when she was brought up with him .
when Mor@@ dec@@ ai perceived all that was done , Mor@@ dec@@ ai rent his clothes , and put on s@@ ack@@ cloth with ashes , and went out into the midst of the city , and cried with a loud and a bitter cry ;
so Es@@ ther 's m@@ aids and her Cham@@ ber@@ l@@ ains came and told it her . then was the queen exceedingly griev@@ ed ; and she sent ra@@ iment to clo@@ the Mor@@ dec@@ ai , and to take away his s@@ ack@@ cloth from him : but he received it not .
nevertheless Ham@@ an ref@@ rained himself : and when he came home , he sent and called for his friends , and Zer@@ esh his wife .
and Ham@@ an told them of the glory of his riches , and the multitude of his children , and all the things where@@ in the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
so Ham@@ an came in . and the king said unto him , What shall be done unto the man whom the king deli@@ ght@@ eth to honour ? now Ham@@ an thought in his heart , To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself ?
and Mor@@ dec@@ ai came again to the king 's gate . but Ham@@ an ha@@ sted to his house mourning , and having his head covered .
then Es@@ ther the queen answered and said , If I have found favour in thy sight , O king , and if it please the king , let my life be given me at my petition , and my people at my request :
and the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden : and Ham@@ an stood up to make request for his life to Es@@ ther the queen ; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king .
and the king took off his ring , which he had taken from Ham@@ an , and gave it unto Mor@@ dec@@ ai . and Es@@ ther set Mor@@ dec@@ ai over the house of Ham@@ an .
for how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people ? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kind@@ red ?
then the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us said unto Es@@ ther the queen and to Mor@@ dec@@ ai the Jew , Be@@ hold , I have given Es@@ ther the house of Ham@@ an , and him they have han@@ ged upon the g@@ allows , because he laid his hand upon the Jews .
the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people , and that the Jews should be ready against that day to av@@ enge themselves on their enemies .
thus the Jews smo@@ te all their enemies with the stroke of the sword , and slaughter , and destruction , and did what they would unto those that hated them .
to st@@ ablis@@ h this among them , that they should keep the four@@ teenth day of the month Ad@@ ar , and the fif@@ teenth day of the same , yearly ,
to confirm these days of Pur@@ im in their times appointed , according as Mor@@ dec@@ ai the Jew and Es@@ ther the queen had enjo@@ ined them , and as they had decre@@ ed for themselves and for their seed , the matters of the fast@@ ings and their cry .
while he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , Th@@ y sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their el@@ dest brother 's house :
then Job arose , and rent his mantle , and sha@@ ved his head , and fell down upon the ground , and wor@@ shipped ,
and he took him a pot@@ sh@@ er@@ d to sc@@ rape himself with@@ al ; and he sat down among the ashes .
and when they lifted up their eyes af@@ ar off , and knew him not , they lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt ; and they rent every one his mantle , and sprink@@ led dust upon their heads toward heaven .
because it shut not up the doors of my mother 's womb , nor hid sorrow from mine eyes .
with kings and counsel@@ lers of the earth , which built des@@ ol@@ ate places for themselves ;
but now it is come upon thee , and thou fain@@ test ; it touch@@ eth thee , and thou art troubled .
is not this thy fear , thy confidence , thy hope , and the upri@@ ghtness of thy ways ?
behold , he put no trust in his servants ; and his angels he charged with folly :
so the poor hath hope , and ini@@ qu@@ ity stop@@ p@@ eth her mouth .
and thou shalt know that thy tab@@ ern@@ acle shall be in peace ; and thou shalt visit thy hab@@ itation , and shalt not sin .
lo this , we have searched it , so it is ; hear it , and know thou it for thy good .
what time they wax warm , they v@@ anish : when it is hot , they are consumed out of their place .
the paths of their way are turned aside ; they go to nothing , and perish .
so that my soul choos@@ eth strang@@ ling , and death rather than my life .
I have sin@@ ned ; what shall I do unto thee , O thou preserv@@ er of men ? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee , so that I am a burden to myself ?
whilst it is yet in his green@@ ness , and not cut down , it with@@ er@@ eth before any other her@@ b .
till he fill thy mouth with laughing , and thy lips with rejo@@ icing .
which remo@@ v@@ eth the mountains , and they know not : which over@@ tur@@ neth them in his anger .
whom , though I were righteous , yet would I not answer , but I would make suppl@@ ication to my judge .
if I justify myself , mine own mouth shall condemn me : if I say , I am perfect , it shall also prove me perverse .
I am afraid of all my sor@@ rows , I know that thou wil@@ t not hold me innocent .
neither is there any day@@ sman bet@@ wi@@ x@@ t us , that might lay his hand upon us both .
then would I speak , and not fear him ; but it is not so with me .
is it good unto thee that thou shoul@@ dest op@@ press , that thou shoul@@ dest desp@@ ise the work of th@@ ine hands , and shine upon the counsel of the wicked ?
and these things hast thou hid in th@@ ine heart : I know that this is with thee .
if I be wicked , w@@ oe unto me ; and if I be righteous , yet will I not lift up my head . I am full of confusion ; therefore see thou mine afflic@@ tion ;
if ini@@ qu@@ ity be in th@@ ine hand , put it far away , and let not w@@ ick@@ edness dwell in thy tab@@ ern@@ acles .
I am as one mo@@ cked of his neighbour , who call@@ eth upon God , and he answ@@ er@@ eth him : the just upright man is laughed to scor@@ n .
the tab@@ ern@@ acles of rob@@ bers prosper , and they that provoke God are secure ; into whose hand God br@@ ing@@ eth ab@@ und@@ antly .
only do not two things unto me : then will I not hide myself from thee .
for thou writ@@ est bitter things against me , and mak@@ est me to possess the ini@@ qu@@ ities of my youth .
seeing his days are determined , the number of his months are with thee , thou hast appointed his bounds that he C@@ AN@@ NOT pass ;
thou shalt call , and I will answer thee : thou wil@@ t have a desire to the work of th@@ ine hands .
for now thou num@@ ber@@ est my steps : d@@ ost thou not watch over my sin ?
th@@ ine own mouth condem@@ neth thee , and not I : ye@@ a , th@@ ine own lips testify against thee .
hast thou heard the secret of God ? and d@@ ost thou restrain wisdom to thy@@ self ?
that thou turn@@ est thy spirit against God , and let@@ test such words go out of thy mouth ?
behold , he put@@ t@@ eth no trust in his saints ; ye@@ a , the heavens are not clean in his sight .
which wise men have told from their fathers , and have not hid it :
for he stret@@ ch@@ eth out his hand against God , and strength@@ en@@ eth himself against the Almighty .
he run@@ neth upon him , even on his neck , upon the thick bosses of his buck@@ lers :
because he cover@@ eth his face with his fat@@ ness , and mak@@ eth col@@ lo@@ ps of fat on his fl@@ an@@ ks .
he shall shake off his un@@ ripe grap@@ e as the vine , and shall cast off his flower as the olive .
I also could speak as ye do : if your soul were in my soul 's stead , I could heap up words against you , and shake mine head at you .
O that one might ple@@ ad for a man with God , as a man ple@@ ad@@ eth for his neighbour !
he that spe@@ ak@@ eth fl@@ attery to his friends , even the eyes of his children shall fail .
he te@@ areth himself in his anger : shall the earth be for@@ s@@ aken for thee ? and shall the rock be removed out of his place ?
my bone cle@@ av@@ eth to my skin and to my flesh , and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth .
though he spare it , and for@@ sake it not ; but keep it still within his mouth :
yet his meat in his bow@@ els is turned , it is the g@@ all of as@@ ps within him .
surely he shall not feel qui@@ et@@ ness in his belly , he shall not save of that which he desired .
for what pleasure hath he in his house after him , when the number of his months is cut off in the midst ?
therefore sn@@ ares are round about thee , and sudden fear troubl@@ eth thee ;
thou shalt make thy prayer unto him , and he shall hear thee , and thou shalt pay thy v@@ ows .
thou shalt also decree a thing , and it shall be established unto thee : and the light shall shine upon thy ways .
even to day is my complaint bitter : my stroke is heavier than my gro@@ aning .
some remove the landmarks ; they violently take away f@@ locks , and feed thereof .
in the dark they dig through houses , which they had marked for themselves in the daytime : they know not the light .
dom@@ inion and fear are with him , he mak@@ eth peace in his high places .
moreover Job continued his parable , and said ,
he buil@@ det@@ h his house as a moth , and as a booth that the keeper mak@@ eth .
moreover Job continued his parable , and said ,
the princes ref@@ rained talking , and laid their hand on their mouth .
then I said , I shall die in my nest , and I shall multiply my days as the sand .
my root was spread out by the waters , and the de@@ w lay all night upon my branch .
after my words they sp@@ ake not again ; and my speech dropped upon them .
they abh@@ or me , they flee far from me , and spare not to sp@@ it in my face .
because he hath loos@@ ed my cord , and afflicted me , they have also let loose the bri@@ dle before me .
How@@ be@@ it he will not stretch out his hand to the grave , though they cry in his destruction .
if his lo@@ ins have not blessed me , and if he were not war@@ med with the fle@@ ece of my sheep ;
I said , Days should speak , and multitude of years should teach wisdom .
behold , my terror shall not make thee afraid , neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee .
he is cha@@ st@@ ened also with pain upon his bed , and the multitude of his bones with strong pain :
his flesh shall be fresh@@ er than a child 's : he shall return to the days of his youth :
if now thou hast understanding , hear this : hear@@ ken to the voice of my words .
should it be according to thy mind ? he will re@@ comp@@ ense it , whether thou refuse , or whether thou choose ; and not I : therefore speak what thou know@@ est .
therefore do@@ th Job open his mouth in vain ; he multi@@ pli@@ eth words without knowledge .
if they obey and serve him , they shall spend their days in prosperity , and their years in pleasures .
and said , Hi@@ therto shalt thou come , but no further : and here shall thy proud waves be stayed ?
will the un@@ ic@@ orn be willing to serve thee , or abide by thy cri@@ b ?
she is hardened against her young ones , as though they were not hers : her labour is in vain without fear ;
do@@ th the haw@@ k fly by thy wisdom , and stretch her wings toward the south ?
do@@ th the eagle mount up at thy command , and make her nest on high ?
wil@@ t thou also dis@@ ann@@ ul my judgment ? wil@@ t thou condemn me , that thou may@@ est be righteous ?
deck thy@@ self now with maj@@ esty and excell@@ ency ; and array thy@@ self with glory and beauty .
can@@ st thou draw out lev@@ i@@ athan with an hook ? or his tongue with a cord which thou let@@ test down ?
will he make a covenant with thee ? wil@@ t thou take him for a servant for ever ?
lay th@@ ine hand upon him , remember the battle , do no more .
the fl@@ akes of his flesh are joined together : they are firm in themselves ; they C@@ AN@@ NOT be moved .
he mak@@ eth a path to shine after him ; one would think the deep to be ho@@ ary .
hear , I bes@@ e@@ ech thee , and I will speak : I will demand of thee , and declare thou unto me .
after this lived Job an hundred and forty years , and saw his sons , and his sons ' sons , even four generations .
and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water , that br@@ ing@@ eth forth his fruit in his season ; his leaf also shall not wi@@ ther ; and whatsoever he do@@ eth shall prosper .
let us break their bands as@@ under , and cast away their cor@@ ds from us .
arise , O LORD ; save me , O my God : for thou hast sm@@ it@@ ten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone ; thou hast broken the teeth of the un@@ go@@ dly .
but know that the LORD hath set apart him that is go@@ dly for himself : the LORD will hear when I call unto him .
for thou art not a God that hath pleasure in w@@ ick@@ edness : neither shall evil dwell with thee .
the foolish shall not stand in thy sight : thou hat@@ est all workers of ini@@ qu@@ ity .
lead me , O LORD , in thy righteousness because of mine enemies ; make thy way straight before my face .
destroy thou them , O God ; let them fall by their own coun@@ sels ; cast them out in the multitude of their trans@@ gres@@ sions ; for they have reb@@ elled against thee .
but let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice : let them ever shout for joy , because thou def@@ end@@ est them : let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee .
for in death there is no rem@@ embrance of thee : in the grave who shall give thee thanks ?
mine eye is consumed because of grief ; it wa@@ x@@ eth old because of all mine enemies .
arise , O LORD , in th@@ ine anger , lift up thy@@ self because of the rage of mine enemies : and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded .
so shall the congregation of the people compass thee about : for their s@@ akes therefore return thou on high .
the LORD shall judge the people : judge me , O LORD , according to my righteousness , and according to mine integrity that is in me .
I will be glad and rejoice in thee : I will sing praise to thy name , O thou most High .
when mine enemies are turned back , they shall fall and perish at thy presence .
and they that know thy name will put their trust in thee : for thou , LORD , hast not for@@ s@@ aken them that seek thee .
for the wicked bo@@ ast@@ eth of his heart 's desire , and bl@@ ess@@ eth the co@@ vet@@ ous , whom the LORD ab@@ hor@@ re@@ th .
he li@@ eth in wait secretly as a lion in his den : he li@@ eth in wait to catch the poor : he do@@ th catch the poor , when he draw@@ eth him into his net .
in the LORD put I my trust : how say ye to my soul , Fle@@ e as a bird to your mountain ?
but I have trusted in thy mercy ; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation .
I will sing unto the LORD , because he hath dealt boun@@ ti@@ fully with me .
Lord , who shall abide in thy tab@@ ern@@ acle ? who shall dwell in thy holy hill ?
he that back@@ bit@@ eth not with his tongue , nor do@@ eth evil to his neighbour , nor tak@@ eth up a repro@@ ach against his neighbour .
he that put@@ t@@ eth not out his money to us@@ ury , nor tak@@ eth reward against the innocent . he that do@@ eth these things shall never be moved .
O my soul , thou hast said unto the LORD , Th@@ ou art my Lord : my goodness exten@@ det@@ h not to thee ;
the LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup : thou main@@ tain@@ est my lot .
for thou wil@@ t not leave my soul in hell ; neither wil@@ t thou suffer th@@ ine Holy One to see corruption .
thou has proved mine heart ; thou hast visited me in the night ; thou has tried me , and shalt find nothing ; I am pur@@ posed that my mouth shall not trans@@ gress .
sh@@ ew thy marv@@ ell@@ ous lov@@ ing@@ kindness , O thou that sav@@ est by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them .
from the wicked that op@@ press me , from my deadly enemies , who compass me about .
they are in@@ closed in their own fat : with their mouth they speak proudly .
arise , O LORD , dis@@ appoint him , cast him down : deliver my soul from the wicked , which is thy sword :
as for me , I will behold thy face in righteousness : I shall be satisfied , when I awake , with thy lik@@ eness .
the LORD is my rock , and my fortress , and my deliver@@ er ; my God , my strength , in whom I will trust ; my Buck@@ ler , and the horn of my salvation , and my high tower .
he made darkness his secret place ; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies .
then the channels of waters were seen , and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebu@@ ke , O LORD , at the blast of the breath of thy no@@ str@@ ils .
the LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness ; according to the clean@@ ness of my hands hath he re@@ comp@@ en@@ sed me .
for I have kept the ways of the LORD , and have not w@@ ick@@ edly departed from my God .
therefore hath the LORD re@@ comp@@ en@@ sed me according to my righteousness , according to the clean@@ ness of my hands in his eye@@ sight .
the strangers shall fade away , and be afraid out of their close places .
he deliver@@ eth me from mine enemies : ye@@ a , thou lif@@ test me up above those that rise up against me : thou hast delivered me from the violent man .
which is as a bri@@ deg@@ room coming out of his chamber , and rejo@@ ic@@ eth as a strong man to run a race .
who can understand his errors ? clean@@ se thou me from secret faults .
remember all thy offerings , and accept thy burnt sacrifice ; Sel@@ ah .
now know I that the LORD sav@@ eth his ano@@ inted ; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand .
they are brought down and fallen : but we are risen , and stand upright .
he asked life of thee , and thou g@@ av@@ est it him , even length of days for ever and ever .
th@@ ine hand shall find out all th@@ ine enemies : thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee .
thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of th@@ ine anger : the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath , and the fire shall dev@@ our them .
for they intended evil against thee : they imagined a mis@@ chiev@@ ous device , which they are not able to perform .
therefore shalt thou make them turn their back , when thou shalt make ready th@@ ine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them .
they g@@ aped upon me with their mouths , as a ra@@ ven@@ ing and a ro@@ aring lion .
they part my garments among them , and cast lots upon my vest@@ ure .
I will declare thy name unto my brethren : in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee .
all they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship : all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him : and none can keep alive his own soul .
this is the generation of them that seek him , that seek thy face , O Jacob . Sel@@ ah .
ye@@ a , let none that wait on thee be ashamed : let them be ashamed which trans@@ gress without cause .
remember not the sins of my youth , nor my trans@@ gres@@ sions : according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness ' sake , O LORD .
consider mine enemies ; for they are many ; and they hate me with cruel hatred .
for thy lov@@ ing@@ kindness is before mine eyes : and I have walked in thy truth .
Lord , I have loved the hab@@ itation of thy house , and the place where th@@ ine honour dwell@@ eth .
gather not my soul with sinners , nor my life with bloody men :
the LORD is my light and my salvation ; whom shall I fear ? the LORD is the strength of my life ; of whom shall I be afraid ?
for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion : in the secret of his tab@@ ern@@ acle shall he hide me ; he shall set me up upon a rock .
when thou s@@ ai@@ d@@ st , Se@@ ek ye my face ; my heart said unto thee , Th@@ y face , LORD , will I seek .
hide not thy face far from me ; put not thy servant away in anger : thou hast been my help ; leave me not , neither for@@ sake me , O God of my salvation .
teach me thy way , O LORD , and lead me in a plain path , because of mine enemies .
hear the voice of my suppl@@ ications , when I cry unto thee , when I lift up my hands toward thy holy or@@ acle .
I cried to thee , O LORD ; and unto the LORD I made suppl@@ ication .
what profit is there in my blood , when I go down to the pit ? shall the dust praise thee ? shall it declare thy truth ?
I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy : for thou hast considered my trouble ; thou hast known my soul in ad@@ versities ;
I was a repro@@ ach among all mine enemies , but especially among my neighbours , and a fear to mine acquaintance : they that did see me without fled from me .
my times are in thy hand : deliver me from the hand of mine enemies , and from them that persec@@ ute me .
make thy face to shine upon thy servant : save me for thy mer@@ cies ' sake .
Oh how great is thy goodness , which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee ; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men !
thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man : thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues .
when I kept silence , my bones wa@@ xed old through my ro@@ aring all the day long .
let thy mercy , O LORD , be upon us , according as we hope in thee .
keep thy tongue from evil , and thy lips from speaking gu@@ ile .
for without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit , which without cause they have di@@ gged for my soul .
stir up thy@@ self , and awake to my judgment , even unto my cause , my God and my Lord .
let them shout for joy , and be glad , that favour my righteous cause : ye@@ a , let them say continually , Let the LORD be magni@@ fied , which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant .
and my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long .
for with thee is the fountain of life : in thy light shall we see light .
O continue thy lov@@ ing@@ kindness unto them that know thee ; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart .
the wicked have drawn out the sword , and have bent their bow , to cast down the poor and ne@@ edy , and to sl@@ ay such as be of upright conversation .
there is no sound@@ ness in my flesh because of th@@ ine anger ; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin .
for my lo@@ ins are filled with a lo@@ ath@@ some disease : and there is no sound@@ ness in my flesh .
Lord , all my desire is before thee ; and my gro@@ aning is not hid from thee .
my lovers and my friends stand alo@@ of from my sore ; and my kin@@ smen stand af@@ ar off .
my heart was hot within me , while I was m@@ using the fire burned : then sp@@ ake I with my tongue ,
and now , Lord , what wait I for ? my hope is in thee .
remove thy stroke away from me : I am consumed by the blow of th@@ ine hand .
hear my prayer , O LORD , and give ear unto my cry ; hold not thy peace at my tears : for I am a stranger with thee , and a so@@ jour@@ ner , as all my fathers were .
and he hath put a new song in my mouth , even praise unto our God : many shall see it , and fear , and shall trust in the LORD .
blessed is that man that mak@@ eth the LORD his trust , and respec@@ t@@ eth not the proud , nor such as turn aside to lies .
I delight to do thy will , O my God : ye@@ a , thy law is within my heart .
I have preached righteousness in the great congregation : lo , I have not ref@@ rained my lips , O LORD , thou know@@ est .
I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart ; I have declared thy faith@@ fulness and thy salvation : I have not concealed thy lov@@ ing@@ kindness and thy truth from the great congregation .
for innumerable evils have comp@@ assed me about : mine ini@@ qu@@ ities have taken hold upon me , so that I am not able to look up ; they are more than the ha@@ irs of mine head : therefore my heart fail@@ eth me .
let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee : let such as love thy salvation say continually , The LORD be magni@@ fied .
and if he come to see me , he spe@@ ak@@ eth van@@ ity : his heart gather@@ eth ini@@ qu@@ ity to itself ; when he go@@ eth abroad , he tell@@ eth it .
all that hate me whis@@ per together against me : against me do they devise my hurt .
all this is come upon us ; yet have we not forgotten thee , neither have we dealt fal@@ sely in thy covenant .
thou LO@@ VE@@ ST righteousness , and hat@@ est w@@ ick@@ edness : therefore God , thy God , hath ano@@ inted thee with the oil of gl@@ ad@@ ness above thy fellows .
kings ' daughters were among thy hon@@ our@@ able women : upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of O@@ ph@@ ir .
so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty : for he is thy Lord ; and worship thou him .
I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations : therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever .
God re@@ ig@@ neth over the he@@ a@@ then : God sit@@ t@@ eth upon the throne of his hol@@ iness .
my mouth shall speak of wisdom ; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding .
they that trust in their wealth , and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches ;
though while he lived he blessed his soul : and men will praise thee , when thou do@@ est well to thy@@ self .
I will take no bul@@ lock out of thy house , nor he goats out of thy fol@@ ds .
but unto the wicked God sa@@ ith , What hast thou to do to declare my statutes , or that thou shoul@@ dest take my covenant in thy mouth ?
seeing thou hat@@ est instruction , and cast@@ est my words behind thee .
thou gi@@ v@@ est thy mouth to evil , and thy tongue fr@@ amet@@ h dece@@ it .
wh@@ os@@ o off@@ er@@ eth praise glori@@ fi@@ eth me : and to him that or@@ der@@ eth his conversation ari@@ ght will I sh@@ ew the salvation of God .
hide thy face from my sins , and b@@ lot out all mine ini@@ qu@@ ities .
restore unto me the joy of thy salvation ; and uphold me with thy free spirit .
O Lord , open thou my lips ; and my mouth shall sh@@ ew forth thy praise .
lo , this is the man that made not God his strength ; but trusted in the abundance of his riches , and strengthened himself in his w@@ ick@@ edness .
for strangers are risen up against me , and op@@ pres@@ sors seek after my soul : they have not set God before them . Sel@@ ah .
he hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him : he hath broken his covenant .
but thou , O God , shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction : bloody and dece@@ it@@ ful men shall not live out half their days ; but I will trust in thee .
what time I am afraid , I will trust in thee .
shall they escape by ini@@ qu@@ ity ? in th@@ ine anger cast down the people , O God .
thou tell@@ est my wan@@ der@@ ings : put thou my tears into thy bottle : are they not in thy book ?
their poison is like the poison of a ser@@ pent : they are like the deaf adder that stop@@ p@@ eth her ear ;
the righteous shall rejoice when he se@@ eth the vengeance : he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked .
the God of my mercy shall prevent me : God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies .
for the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride : and for cur@@ sing and lying which they speak .
unto thee , O my strength , will I sing : for God is my defence , and the God of my mercy .
Gil@@ e@@ ad is mine , and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h is mine ; E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im also is the strength of mine head ; Jud@@ ah is my law@@ gi@@ ver ;
so will I sing praise unto thy name for ever , that I may daily perform my v@@ ows .
in God is my salvation and my glory : the rock of my strength , and my refuge , is in God .
thus will I bless thee while I live : I will lift up my hands in thy name .
who wh@@ et their tongue like a sword , and bend their b@@ ows to shoot their arrows , even bitter words :
that they may shoot in secret at the perfect : suddenly do they shoot at him , and fear not .
so they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves : all that see them shall flee away .
blessed is the man whom thou choos@@ est , and caus@@ est to approach unto thee , that he may dwell in thy courts : we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house , even of thy holy temple .
which my lips have uttered , and my mouth hath spoken , when I was in trouble .
then shall the earth yield her increase ; and God , even our own God , shall bless us .
but God shall wound the head of his enemies , and the hair@@ y scal@@ p of such an one as go@@ eth on still in his t@@ resp@@ asses .
that thy foot may be di@@ pped in the blood of th@@ ine enemies , and the tongue of thy dogs in the same .
because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee .
princes shall come out of Egypt ; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God .
O God , thou know@@ est my fool@@ is@@ hness ; and my sins are not hid from thee .
let not them that wait on thee , O Lord GO@@ D of hosts , be ashamed for my sake : let not those that seek thee be conf@@ ounded for my sake , O God of Israel .
because for thy sake I have borne repro@@ ach ; shame hath covered my face .
for the zeal of th@@ ine house hath eaten me up ; and the repro@@ aches of them that repro@@ ached thee are fallen upon me .
I made s@@ ack@@ cloth also my garment ; and I became a prover@@ b to them .
but as for me , my prayer is unto thee , O LORD , in an acceptable time : O God , in the multitude of thy mercy hear me , in the truth of thy salvation .
and hide not thy face from thy servant ; for I am in trouble : hear me spe@@ ed@@ ily .
draw ni@@ gh unto my soul , and re@@ deem it : deliver me because of mine enemies .
add ini@@ qu@@ ity unto their ini@@ qu@@ ity : and let them not come into thy righteousness .
let them be ashamed and conf@@ ounded that seek after my soul : let them be turned backward , and put to confusion , that desire my hurt .
let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee : and let such as love thy salvation say continually , Let God be magni@@ fied .
for mine enemies speak against me ; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together ,
let them be conf@@ ounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul ; let them be covered with repro@@ ach and dis@@ honour that seek my hurt .
O God , thou hast taught me from my youth : and hitherto have I declared thy won@@ dr@@ ous works .
but as for me , my feet were almost gone ; my steps had well ni@@ gh slipped .
they set their mouth against the heavens , and their tongue wal@@ ket@@ h through the earth .
if I say , I will speak thus ; behold , I should offend against the generation of thy children .
for , lo , they that are far from thee shall perish : thou hast destroyed all them that go a wh@@ oring from thee .
but it is good for me to draw near to God : I have put my trust in the Lord GO@@ D , that I may declare all thy works .
remember thy congregation , which thou hast purchased of old ; the rod of th@@ ine inheritance , which thou hast re@@ deemed ; this mount Z@@ ion , where@@ in thou hast d@@ wel@@ t .
th@@ ine enemies ro@@ ar in the midst of thy congre@@ gations ; they set up their en@@ signs for signs .
they said in their hearts , Let us destroy them together : they have burned up all the syn@@ agogues of God in the land .
forget not the voice of th@@ ine enemies : the tum@@ ult of those that rise up against thee increas@@ eth continually .
the st@@ ou@@ the@@ ar@@ ted are spoiled , they have slept their sleep : and none of the men of might have found their hands .
thou , even thou , art to be feared : and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry ?
thou hol@@ dest mine eyes waking : I am so troubled that I C@@ AN@@ NOT speak .
I will meditate also of all thy work , and talk of thy do@@ ings .
the voice of thy thunder was in the heaven : the light@@ nings lighten@@ ed the world : the earth trem@@ bled and shook .
that they might set their hope in God , and not forget the works of God , but keep his commandments :
and might not be as their fathers , a stubborn and rebelli@@ ous generation ; a generation that set not their heart ari@@ ght , and whose spirit was not st@@ ed@@ fast with God .
and they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust .
he caused an east wind to blow in the heaven : and by his power he brought in the south wind .
nevertheless they did fl@@ atter him with their mouth , and they lied unto him with their tongues .
but he , being full of compassion , for@@ gave their ini@@ qu@@ ity , and destroyed them not : ye@@ a , many a time turned he his anger away , and did not stir up all his wrath .
for they provoked him to anger with their high places , and moved him to jealousy with their gra@@ ven images .
so he fed them according to the integrity of his heart ; and guided them by the sk@@ il@@ fulness of his hands .
pour out thy wrath upon the he@@ a@@ then that have not known thee , and upon the king@@ doms that have not called upon thy name .
so we thy people and sheep of thy past@@ ure will give thee thanks for ever : we will sh@@ ew forth thy praise to all generations .
so will not we go back from thee : quick@@ en us , and we will call upon thy name .
for they have consulted together with one consent : they are con@@ feder@@ ate against thee :
ye@@ a , the spar@@ row hath found an house , and the swallow a nest for herself , where she may lay her young , even th@@ ine al@@ t@@ ars , O LORD of hosts , my King , and my God .
for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand . I had rather be a door@@ keeper in the house of my God , than to dwell in the tents of w@@ ick@@ edness .
O LORD of hosts , blessed is the man that trust@@ eth in thee .
righteousness shall go before him ; and shall set us in the way of his steps .
preserve my soul ; for I am holy : O thou my God , save thy servant that trust@@ eth in thee .
in the day of my trouble I will call upon thee : for thou wil@@ t answer me .
O God , the proud are risen against me , and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul ; and have not set thee before them .
free among the dead , like the sl@@ ain that lie in the grave , whom thou remem@@ ber@@ est no more : and they are cut off from thy hand .
thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me ; thou hast made me an ab@@ om@@ ination unto them : I am shut up , and I C@@ AN@@ NOT come forth .
shall thy lov@@ ing@@ kindness be declared in the grave ? or thy faith@@ fulness in destruction ?
but unto thee have I cried , O LORD ; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee .
lover and friend hast thou put far from me , and mine acquaintance into darkness .
and the heavens shall praise thy wonders , O LORD : thy faith@@ fulness also in the congregation of the saints .
thou hast broken Ra@@ hab in pieces , as one that is sl@@ ain ; thou hast scattered th@@ ine enemies with thy strong arm .
justice and judgment are the hab@@ itation of thy throne : mercy and truth shall go before thy face .
blessed is the people that know the joyful sound : they shall walk , O LORD , in the light of thy coun@@ tenance .
if his children for@@ sake my law , and walk not in my judgments ;
if they break my statutes , and keep not my commandments ;
nevertheless my lov@@ ing@@ kindness will I not utterly take from him , nor suffer my faith@@ fulness to fail .
but thou hast cast off and ab@@ hor@@ red , thou hast been w@@ ro@@ th with th@@ ine ano@@ inted .
all that pass by the way spoil him : he is a repro@@ ach to his neighbours .
what man is he that liv@@ eth , and shall not see death ? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave ? Sel@@ ah .
because thou hast made the LORD , which is my refuge , even the most High , thy hab@@ itation ;
for he shall give his angels charge over thee , to keep thee in all thy ways .
ye that love the LORD , hate evil : he preserv@@ eth the souls of his saints ; he deliver@@ eth them out of the hand of the wicked .
he that work@@ eth dece@@ it shall not dwell within my house : he that tell@@ eth lies shall not tar@@ ry in my sight .
hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble ; incl@@ ine th@@ ine ear unto me : in the day when I call answer me spe@@ ed@@ ily .
because of th@@ ine indignation and thy wrath : for thou hast lifted me up , and cast me down .
so the he@@ a@@ then shall fear the name of the LORD , and all the kings of the earth thy glory .
when the LORD shall build up Z@@ ion , he shall appear in his glory .
the children of thy servants shall continue , and their seed shall be established before thee .
he made known his ways unto Moses , his acts unto the children of Israel .
man go@@ eth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening .
that thou gi@@ v@@ est them they gather : thou open@@ est th@@ ine hand , they are filled with good .
saying , Touch not mine ano@@ inted , and do my prophets no harm .
and he brought forth his people with joy , and his chosen with gl@@ ad@@ ness :
thus they changed their glory into the simil@@ itude of an ox that e@@ at@@ eth grass .
but mur@@ mu@@ red in their tents , and hear@@ k@@ ened not unto the voice of the LORD .
thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions : and the plague brake in upon them .
ye@@ a , they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto dev@@ ils ,
and shed innocent blood , even the blood of their sons and of their daughters , whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Can@@ a@@ an : and the land was polluted with blood .
many times did he deliver them ; but they provoked him with their counsel , and were brought low for their ini@@ qu@@ ity .
and he remembered for them his covenant , and rep@@ ented according to the multitude of his mer@@ cies .
fo@@ ols because of their trans@@ g@@ ression , and because of their ini@@ qu@@ ities , are afflicted .
let his children be continually vag@@ ab@@ onds , and beg : let them seek their bread also out of their des@@ ol@@ ate places .
let mine adversaries be clo@@ thed with shame , and let them cover themselves with their own confusion , as with a mantle .
the LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Z@@ ion : rule thou in the midst of th@@ ine enemies .
the Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath .
a good man sh@@ ew@@ eth favour , and len@@ det@@ h : he will guide his affairs with discretion .
his heart is established , he shall not be afraid , until he see his desire upon his enemies .
not unto us , O LORD , not unto us , but unto thy name give glory , for thy mercy , and for thy truth 's sake .
O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes !
then shall I not be ashamed , when I have respect unto all thy commandments .
I will praise thee with upri@@ ghtness of heart , when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments .
I will keep thy statutes : O for@@ sake me not utterly .
where@@ with@@ al shall a young man clean@@ se his way ? by taking heed there@@ to according to thy word .
with my whole heart have I sought thee : O let me not wander from thy commandments .
blessed art thou , O LORD : teach me thy statutes .
thou hast rebu@@ ked the proud that are cur@@ sed , which do er@@ r from thy commandments .
my soul mel@@ t@@ eth for heav@@ iness : strengthen thou me according unto thy word .
I have chosen the way of truth : thy judgments have I laid before me .
I will run the way of thy commandments , when thou shalt enlarge my heart .
St@@ ablis@@ h thy word unto thy servant , who is devoted to thy fear .
and take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth ; for I have hoped in thy judgments .
I will speak of thy testim@@ onies also before kings , and will not be ashamed .
my hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments , which I have loved ; and I will meditate in thy statutes .
I remembered thy judgments of old , O LORD ; and have comfor@@ ted myself .
thou art my portion , O LORD : I have said that I would keep thy words .
at midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments .
thou hast dealt well with thy servant , O LORD , according unto thy word .
teach me good judgment and knowledge : for I have believed thy commandments .
thou art good , and do@@ est good ; teach me thy statutes .
it is good for me that I have been afflicted ; that I might learn thy statutes .
let the proud be ashamed ; for they dealt per@@ vers@@ ely with me without a cause : but I will meditate in thy prec@@ epts .
they continue this day according to th@@ ine ordin@@ ances : for all are thy servants .
thou through thy commandments hast made me wis@@ er than mine enemies : for they are ever with me .
I have not departed from thy judgments : for thou hast taught me .
how sweet are thy words unto my taste ! ye@@ a , swe@@ eter than honey to my mouth !
I am afflicted very much : quick@@ en me , O LORD , according unto thy word .
my soul is continually in my hand : yet do I not forget thy law .
the wicked have laid a sn@@ are for me : yet I er@@ red not from thy prec@@ epts .
my flesh trem@@ bl@@ eth for fear of thee ; and I am afraid of thy judgments .
I have done judgment and justice : leave me not to mine op@@ pres@@ sors .
mine eyes fail for thy salvation , and for the word of thy righteousness .
therefore I love thy commandments above gold ; ye@@ a , above fine gold .
my zeal hath consumed me , because mine enemies have forgotten thy words .
I am small and desp@@ ised : yet do not I forget thy prec@@ epts .
trouble and angu@@ ish have taken hold on me : yet thy commandments are my deli@@ ghts .
I cried with my whole heart ; hear me , O LORD : I will keep thy statutes .
salvation is far from the wicked : for they seek not thy statutes .
I have long@@ ed for thy salvation , O LORD ; and thy law is my delight .
I have gone astr@@ ay like a lost sheep ; seek thy servant ; for I do not forget thy commandments .
he will not suffer thy foot to be moved : he that keep@@ eth thee will not sl@@ umber .
peace be within thy walls , and prosperity within thy palaces .
for the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous ; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto ini@@ qu@@ ity .
do good , O LORD , unto those that be good , and to them that are upright in their hearts .
happy is the man that hath his qui@@ ver full of them : they shall not be ashamed , but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate .
for thou shalt eat the labour of th@@ ine hands : happy shalt thou be , and it shall be well with thee .
thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of th@@ ine house : thy children like olive plants round about thy table .
the LORD shall bless thee out of Z@@ ion : and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life .
ye@@ a , thou shalt see thy children 's children , and peace upon Israel .
many a time have they afflicted me from my youth , may Israel now say :
many a time have they afflicted me from my youth : yet they have not prevailed against me .
where@@ with the m@@ ower f@@ ill@@ eth not his hand ; nor he that b@@ ind@@ eth she@@ aves his bos@@ om .
Lord , hear my voice : let th@@ ine ears be attentive to the voice of my suppl@@ ications .
I will not give sleep to mine eyes , or sl@@ umber to mine ey@@ eli@@ ds ,
arise , O LORD , into thy rest ; thou , and the ark of thy strength .
the LORD will perfect that which concer@@ neth me : thy mercy , O LORD , endu@@ re@@ th for ever : for@@ sake not the works of th@@ ine own hands .
thou comp@@ ass@@ est my path and my lying down , and art acquainted with all my ways .
for there is not a word in my tongue , but , lo , O LORD , thou know@@ est it altogether .
whi@@ ther shall I go from thy spirit ? or whi@@ ther shall I flee from thy presence ?
ye@@ a , the darkness hi@@ det@@ h not from thee ; but the night sh@@ in@@ eth as the day : the darkness and the light are both alike to thee .
my substance was not hid from thee , when I was made in secret , and curi@@ ously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth .
how precious also are thy thoughts unto me , O God ! how great is the sum of them !
for they speak against thee w@@ ick@@ edly , and th@@ ine enemies take thy name in vain .
do not I hate them , O LORD , that hate thee ? and am not I griev@@ ed with those that rise up against thee ?
they have sharpen@@ ed their tongues like a ser@@ pent ; Ad@@ ders ' poison is under their lips . Sel@@ ah .
O GO@@ D the Lord , the strength of my salvation , thou hast covered my head in the day of battle .
let my prayer be set forth before thee as inc@@ ense ; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice .
incl@@ ine not my heart to any evil thing , to practi@@ se wicked works with men that work ini@@ qu@@ ity : and let me not eat of their d@@ ain@@ ties .
attend unto my cry ; for I am brought very low : deliver me from my persec@@ utors ; for they are stronger than I.
hear my prayer , O LORD , give ear to my suppl@@ ications : in thy faith@@ fulness answer me , and in thy righteousness .
I remember the days of old ; I meditate on all thy works ; I m@@ use on the work of thy hands .
hear me spe@@ ed@@ ily , O LORD : my spirit fail@@ eth : hide not thy face from me , lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit .
cause me to hear thy lov@@ ing@@ kindness in the morning ; for in thee do I trust : cause me to know the way where@@ in I should walk ; for I lift up my soul unto thee .
teach me to do thy will ; for thou art my God : thy spirit is good ; lead me into the land of upri@@ ghtness .
quick@@ en me , O LORD , for thy name 's sake : for thy righteousness ' sake bring my soul out of trouble .
one generation shall praise thy works to another , and shall declare thy mighty acts .
they shall ab@@ und@@ antly utter the memory of thy great goodness , and shall sing of thy righteousness .
the eyes of all wait upon thee ; and thou gi@@ v@@ est them their meat in due season .
for he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates ; he hath blessed thy children within thee .
let Israel rejoice in him that made him : let the children of Z@@ ion be joyful in their King .
let the saints be joyful in glory : let them sing aloud upon their beds .
for they shall be an or@@ nament of grace unto thy head , and chains about thy neck .
but ye have set at n@@ ought all my counsel , and would none of my re@@ proof :
he keep@@ eth the paths of judgment , and preserv@@ eth the way of his saints .
whose ways are cro@@ oked , and they fro@@ ward in their paths :
my son , forget not my law ; but let th@@ ine heart keep my commandments :
trust in the LORD with all th@@ ine heart ; and lean not unto th@@ ine own understanding .
it shall be health to thy nav@@ el , and marrow to thy bones .
honour the LORD with thy substance , and with the fir@@ st@@ fruits of all th@@ ine increase :
so shall they be life unto thy soul , and grace to thy neck .
say not unto thy neighbour , Go , and come again , and to mor@@ row I will give ; when thou hast it by thee .
for I was my father 's son , tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother .
put away from thee a fro@@ ward mouth , and perverse lips put far from thee .
lest strangers be filled with thy wealth ; and thy lab@@ ours be in the house of a stranger ;
and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers , nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me !
give not sleep to th@@ ine eyes , nor sl@@ umber to th@@ ine ey@@ eli@@ ds .
my son , keep thy father 's commandment , and for@@ sake not the law of thy mother :
can one go upon hot co@@ als , and his feet not be burned ?
men do not desp@@ ise a thief , if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry ;
but wh@@ os@@ o commit@@ t@@ eth adul@@ tery with a woman l@@ ack@@ eth understanding : he that do@@ eth it destro@@ y@@ eth his own soul .
my son , keep my words , and lay up my commandments with thee .
say unto wisdom , Th@@ ou art my sister ; and call understanding thy kin@@ sw@@ oman :
that they may keep thee from the strange woman , from the stranger which fl@@ atter@@ eth with her words .
he hath taken a bag of money with him , and will come home at the day appointed .
my fruit is better than gold , ye@@ a , than fine gold ; and my revenue than choice silver .
the LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way , before his works of old .
blessed is the man that he@@ areth me , watching daily at my gates , waiting at the posts of my doors .
for by me thy days shall be multiplied , and the years of thy life shall be increased .
if thou be wise , thou shalt be wise for thy@@ self : but if thou scor@@ nest , thou alone shalt bear it .
he that with@@ hol@@ det@@ h corn , the people shall curse him : but blessing shall be upon the head of him that sel@@ let@@ h it .
he that is desp@@ ised , and hath a servant , is better than he that hon@@ ou@@ re@@ th himself , and l@@ ack@@ eth bread .
he that til@@ let@@ h his land shall be satisfied with bread : but he that follow@@ eth vain persons is void of understanding .
he that keep@@ eth his mouth keep@@ eth his life : but he that open@@ eth wide his lips shall have destruction .
wh@@ os@@ o desp@@ is@@ eth the word shall be destroyed : but he that fe@@ areth the commandment shall be rewarded .
he that sp@@ areth his rod hat@@ eth his son : but he that lov@@ eth him cha@@ sten@@ eth him be@@ times .
the back@@ slider in heart shall be filled with his own ways : and a good man shall be satisfied from himself .
the poor is hated even of his own neighbour : but the rich hath many friends .
he that desp@@ is@@ eth his neighbour sin@@ neth : but he that hath mercy on the poor , happy is he .
a fool desp@@ is@@ eth his father 's instruction : but he that regar@@ det@@ h re@@ proof is prudent .
a wise son mak@@ eth a glad father : but a foolish man desp@@ is@@ eth his mother .
the LORD hath made all things for himself : ye@@ a , even the wicked for the day of evil .
the highway of the upright is to depart from evil : he that keep@@ eth his way preserv@@ eth his soul .
he that lab@@ ou@@ re@@ th lab@@ ou@@ re@@ th for himself ; for his mouth cra@@ v@@ eth it of him .
a violent man entic@@ eth his neighbour , and lead@@ eth him into the way that is not good .
he lov@@ eth trans@@ g@@ ression that lov@@ eth strife : and he that exal@@ t@@ eth his gate see@@ ket@@ h destruction .
he that beg@@ et@@ t@@ eth a fool do@@ eth it to his sorrow : and the father of a fool hath no joy .
a foolish son is a grief to his father , and bitterness to her that bare him .
he that get@@ t@@ eth wisdom lov@@ eth his own soul : he that keep@@ eth understanding shall find good .
he that keep@@ eth the commandment keep@@ eth his own soul ; but he that desp@@ is@@ eth his ways shall die .
a king that sit@@ t@@ eth in the throne of judgment sc@@ atter@@ eth away all evil with his eyes .
wh@@ os@@ o stop@@ p@@ eth his ears at the cry of the poor , he also shall cry himself , but shall not be heard .
wh@@ os@@ o keep@@ eth his mouth and his tongue keep@@ eth his soul from troubles .
thor@@ ns and sn@@ ares are in the way of the fro@@ ward : he that do@@ th keep his soul shall be far from them .
if thou hast nothing to pay , why should he take away thy bed from under thee ?
remove not the ancient landmark , which thy fathers have set .
a wise man is strong ; ye@@ a , a man of knowledge increas@@ eth strength .
for by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war : and in multitude of counsel@@ lers there is safety .
wisdom is too high for a fool : he open@@ eth not his mouth in the gate .
debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself ; and discover not a secret to another :
as he that tak@@ eth away a garment in cold weather , and as vin@@ eg@@ ar upon nit@@ re , so is he that sing@@ eth songs to an heavy heart .
he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down , and without walls .
as a dog re@@ tur@@ neth to his vom@@ it , so a fool re@@ tur@@ neth to his folly .
the slo@@ thful hi@@ det@@ h his hand in his bos@@ om ; it griev@@ eth him to bring it again to his mouth .
so is the man that decei@@ v@@ eth his neighbour , and sa@@ ith , Am not I in sport ?
let another man praise thee , and not th@@ ine own mouth ; a stranger , and not th@@ ine own lips .
o@@ int@@ ment and perf@@ ume rejoice the heart : so do@@ th the sweet@@ ness of a man 's friend by hearty counsel .
wh@@ oso@@ ever hi@@ det@@ h her hi@@ det@@ h the wind , and the o@@ int@@ ment of his right hand , which be@@ w@@ ra@@ y@@ eth itself .
better is the poor that wal@@ ket@@ h in his upri@@ ghtness , than he that is perverse in his ways , though he be rich .
he that tur@@ neth away his ear from hearing the law , even his prayer shall be ab@@ om@@ ination .
he that til@@ let@@ h his land shall have plenty of bread : but he that follow@@ eth after vain persons shall have poverty enough .
wh@@ os@@ o rob@@ bet@@ h his father or his mother , and sa@@ ith , It is no trans@@ g@@ ression ; the same is the companion of a destro@@ yer .
he that gi@@ v@@ eth unto the poor shall not lack : but he that hi@@ det@@ h his eyes shall have many a curse .
he , that being often re@@ proved har@@ den@@ eth his neck , shall suddenly be destroyed , and that without remedy .
a man that fl@@ atter@@ eth his neighbour spread@@ eth a net for his feet .
wh@@ os@@ o is partner with a thief hat@@ eth his own soul : he he@@ areth cur@@ sing , and be@@ w@@ ra@@ y@@ eth it not .
two things have I required of thee ; deny me them not before I die :
there is a generation that are pure in their own eyes , and yet is not washed from their fil@@ thiness .
for an o@@ dious woman when she is married ; and an hand@@ maid that is heir to her mistress .
the ants are a people not strong , yet they prepare their meat in the summer ;
give not thy strength unto women , nor thy ways to that which destro@@ y@@ eth kings .
let him drink , and forget his poverty , and remember his misery no more .
she gir@@ det@@ h her lo@@ ins with strength , and strength@@ en@@ eth her arms .
she lay@@ eth her hands to the sp@@ ind@@ le , and her hands hold the dist@@ aff .
I commun@@ ed with mine own heart , saying , L@@ o , I am come to great estate , and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem : ye@@ a , my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge .
and whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them , I with@@ held not my heart from any joy ; for my heart rejo@@ iced in all my labour : and this was my portion of all my labour .
for what hath man of all his labour , and of the v@@ ex@@ ation of his heart , where@@ in he hath lab@@ oured under the sun ?
there is nothing better for a man , than that he should eat and drink , and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour . this also I saw , that it was from the hand of God .
I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men , that God might manifest them , and that they might see that they themselves are beasts .
the fool fol@@ det@@ h his hands together , and e@@ at@@ eth his own flesh .
be not rash with thy mouth , and let not th@@ ine heart be ha@@ sty to utter any thing before God : for God is in heaven , and thou upon earth : therefore let thy words be few .
be not righteous over much ; neither make thy@@ self over wise : why shoul@@ dest thou destroy thy@@ self ?
go thy way , eat thy bread with joy , and drink thy wine with a mer@@ ry heart ; for God now accept@@ eth thy works .
in the morning sow thy seed , and in the evening with@@ hold not th@@ ine hand : for thou know@@ est not whether shall prosper , either this or that , or whether they both shall be alike good .
the song of songs , which is Solomon 's .
we will make thee borders of gold with stu@@ ds of silver .
behold , thou art fair , my love ; behold , thou art fair ; thou hast d@@ oves ' eyes within thy locks : thy hair is as a flock of goats , that appear from mount Gil@@ e@@ ad .
thy lips are like a thread of scar@@ let , and thy speech is com@@ ely : thy temples are like a piece of a p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate within thy locks .
how fair is thy love , my sister , my spouse ! how much better is thy love than wine ! and the smell of th@@ ine o@@ int@@ ments than all spices !
thy lips , O my spouse , drop as the honey@@ comb : honey and milk are under thy tongue ; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon .
awake , O north wind ; and come , thou south ; blow upon my garden , that the spices thereof may flow out . let my beloved come into his garden , and eat his pleasant fruits .
I rose up to open to my beloved ; and my hands dropped with my@@ rr@@ h , and my fingers with sweet sm@@ elling my@@ rr@@ h , upon the handles of the lock .
my beloved is gone down into his garden , to the beds of spices , to feed in the gardens , and to gather l@@ ilies .
as a piece of a p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate are thy temples within thy locks .
my do@@ ve , my un@@ de@@ filed is but one ; she is the only one of her mother , she is the choice one of her that bare her . the daughters saw her , and blessed her ; ye@@ a , the que@@ ens and the conc@@ ub@@ ines , and they praised her .
how beautiful are thy feet with shoes , O prince 's daughter ! the joints of thy thi@@ gh@@ s are like jew@@ els , the work of the hands of a cunning work@@ man .
and the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved , that go@@ eth down swe@@ etly , causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak .
the man@@ dr@@ akes give a smell , and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits , new and old , which I have laid up for thee , O my beloved .
O that thou w@@ ert as my brother , that su@@ cked the breasts of my mother ! when I should find thee without , I would kiss thee ; ye@@ a , I should not be desp@@ ised .
I would lead thee , and bring thee into my mother 's house , who would instruct me : I would cause thee to drink of sp@@ iced wine of the juice of my p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate .
the ox know@@ eth his owner , and the ass his master 's cri@@ b : but Israel do@@ th not know , my people do@@ th not consider .
and I will turn my hand upon thee , and purely purge away thy d@@ ross , and take away all thy tin :
and he shall judge among the nations , and shall rebu@@ ke many people : and they shall beat their s@@ words into pl@@ ow@@ shares , and their spe@@ ars into pr@@ un@@ in@@ gh@@ oo@@ ks : nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
their land also is full of idols ; they worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fingers have made :
and the people shall be oppressed , every one by another , and every one by his neighbour : the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient , and the base against the hon@@ our@@ able .
now will I sing to my well@@ beloved a song of my beloved touching his viney@@ ard . my well@@ beloved hath a viney@@ ard in a very fruitful hill :
what could have been done more to my viney@@ ard , that I have not done in it ? W@@ herefore , when I looked that it should bring forth grapes , brought it forth wild grapes ?
w@@ oe unto them that draw ini@@ qu@@ ity with cor@@ ds of van@@ ity , and sin as it were with a cart rope :
above it stood the ser@@ ap@@ him@@ s : each one had six wings ; with tw@@ ain he covered his face , and with tw@@ ain he covered his feet , and with tw@@ ain he did fly .
the LORD shall bring upon thee , and upon thy people , and upon thy father 's house , days that have not come , from the day that E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im departed from Jud@@ ah ; even the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
and I took unto me faithful witnesses to record , Uri@@ ah the priest , and Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah the son of Je@@ ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah .
and he shall s@@ nat@@ ch on the right hand , and be hungry ; and he shall eat on the left hand , and they shall not be satisfied : they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm :
I have commanded my sancti@@ fied ones , I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger , even them that rejoice in my high@@ ness .
and the people shall take them , and bring them to their place : and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and hand@@ m@@ aids : and they shall take them cap@@ tives , whose cap@@ tives they were ; and they shall rule over their op@@ pres@@ sors .
and it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow , and from thy fear , and from the hard bond@@ age where@@ in thou w@@ ast made to serve ,
hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming : it stir@@ re@@ th up the dead for thee , even all the chief ones of the earth ; it hath raised up from their thr@@ ones all the kings of the nations .
at that day shall a man look to his Maker , and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel .
at the same time sp@@ ake the LORD by Isaiah the son of A@@ mo@@ z , saying , Go and loose the s@@ ack@@ cloth from off thy lo@@ ins , and put off thy shoe from thy foot . and he did so , walking naked and b@@ are@@ foot .
he will surely violently turn and tos@@ s thee like a ball into a large country : there shalt thou die , and there the ch@@ ari@@ ots of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord 's house .
and he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them , as he that swim@@ met@@ h spread@@ eth forth his hands to swim : and he shall bring down their pride together with the spo@@ ils of their hands .
ye@@ a , in the way of thy judgments , O LORD , have we waited for thee ; the desire of our soul is to thy name , and to the rem@@ embrance of thee .
O LORD our God , other lords beside thee have had dom@@ inion over us : but by thee only will we make mention of thy name .
or let him take hold of my strength , that he may make peace with me ; and he shall make peace with me .
but when he se@@ eth his children , the work of mine hands , in the midst of him , they shall sancti@@ fy my name , and sancti@@ fy the Holy One of Jacob , and shall fear the God of Israel .
and though the Lord give you the bread of ad@@ versity , and the water of afflic@@ tion , yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more , but th@@ ine eyes shall see thy teachers :
for in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver , and his idols of gold , which your own hands have made unto you for a sin .
and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times , and strength of salvation : the fear of the LORD is his treasure .
there shall the great owl make her nest , and lay , and hat@@ ch , and gather under her shadow : there shall the vul@@ tures also be gathered , every one with her mate .
then said Eli@@ ak@@ im and She@@ b@@ na and Jo@@ ah unto Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h , Spe@@ ak , I pray thee , unto thy servants in the Syrian language ; for we understand it : and speak not to us in the Jews ' language , in the ears of the people that are on the wall .
but Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h said , H@@ ath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words ? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall , that they may eat their own d@@ ung , and drink their own p@@ iss with you ?
hear@@ ken not to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah : for thus sa@@ ith the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , Make an agreement with me by a present , and come out to me : and eat ye every one of his vine , and every one of his fi@@ g tree , and drink ye every one the waters of his own ci@@ stern ;
who are they among all the gods of these lands , that have delivered their land out of my hand , that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand ?
but I know thy ab@@ ode , and thy going out , and thy coming in , and thy rage against me .
go , and say to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , the God of David thy father , I have heard thy prayer , I have seen thy tears : behold , I will add unto thy days fifteen years .
I said in the cutting off of my days , I shall go to the gates of the grave : I am deprived of the resi@@ due of my years .
what shall I say ? he hath both spoken unto me , and himself hath done it : I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul .
for the grave C@@ AN@@ NOT praise thee , death can not celebrate thee : they that go down into the pit C@@ AN@@ NOT hope for thy truth .
behold , the days come , that all that is in th@@ ine house , and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day , shall be carried to Babylon : nothing shall be left , sa@@ ith the LORD .
who raised up the righteous man from the east , called him to his foot , gave the nations before him , and made him rule over kings ? he gave them as the dust to his sword , and as driven stub@@ ble to his bow .
for I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand , saying unto thee , Fe@@ ar not ; I will help thee .
but now thus sa@@ ith the LORD that created thee , O Jacob , and he that formed thee , O Israel , Fe@@ ar not : for I have re@@ deemed thee , I have called thee by thy name ; thou art mine .
for I am the LORD thy God , the Holy One of Israel , thy Saviour : I gave Egypt for thy ran@@ som , Ethiopia and Se@@ ba for thee .
since thou w@@ ast precious in my sight , thou hast been hon@@ our@@ able , and I have loved thee : therefore will I give men for thee , and people for thy life .
this people have I formed for myself ; they shall sh@@ ew forth my praise .
thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings ; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices . I have not caused thee to serve with an offering , nor wear@@ ied thee with inc@@ ense .
thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money , neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices : but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins , thou hast wear@@ ied me with th@@ ine ini@@ qu@@ ities .
I , even I , am he that blo@@ tt@@ eth out thy trans@@ gres@@ sions for mine own sake , and will not remember thy sins .
for I will pour water upon him that is thir@@ sty , and floods upon the dry ground : I will pour my spirit upon thy seed , and my blessing upon th@@ ine offspring :
he feed@@ eth on ashes : a deceived heart hath turned him aside , that he C@@ AN@@ NOT deliver his soul , nor say , Is there not a lie in my right hand ?
that sa@@ ith to the deep , Be dry , and I will dry up thy rivers :
I have made the earth , and created man upon it : I , even my hands , have stretched out the heavens , and all their host have I commanded .
and thou s@@ ai@@ d@@ st , I shall be a lady for ever : so that thou did@@ st not lay these things to thy heart , neither did@@ st remember the latter end of it .
therefore hear now this , thou that art given to pleasures , that dwell@@ est ca@@ relessly , that say@@ est in th@@ ine heart , I am , and none else beside me ; I shall not sit as a widow , neither shall I know the loss of children :
stand now with th@@ ine enchan@@ tments , and with the multitude of thy sorcer@@ ies , where@@ in thou hast lab@@ oured from thy youth ; if so be thou shalt be able to profit , if so be thou may@@ est prevail .
behold , they shall be as stub@@ ble ; the fire shall burn them ; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame : there shall not be a coal to warm at , nor fire to sit before it .
for mine own sake , even for mine own sake , will I do it : for how should my name be polluted ? and I will not give my glory unto another .
thy seed also had been as the sand , and the offspring of thy bow@@ els like the gra@@ vel thereof ; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me .
and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword ; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me , and made me a polished shaft ; in his qui@@ ver hath he hid me ;
and said unto me , Th@@ ou art my servant , O Israel , in whom I will be glori@@ fied .
can a woman forget her su@@ cking child , that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb ? ye@@ a , they may forget , yet will I not forget thee .
but thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Even the cap@@ tives of the mighty shall be taken away , and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered : for I will contend with him that cont@@ en@@ det@@ h with thee , and I will save thy children .
thus sa@@ ith thy Lord the LORD , and thy God that ple@@ ad@@ eth the cause of his people , Be@@ hold , I have taken out of th@@ ine hand the cup of trembling , even the d@@ reg@@ s of the cup of my fury ; thou shalt no more drink it again :
awake , awake ; put on thy strength , O Z@@ ion ; put on thy beautiful garments , O Jerusalem , the holy city : for h@@ ence@@ forth there shall no more come into thee the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised and the un@@ clean .
shake thy@@ self from the dust ; arise , and sit down , O Jerusalem : loose thy@@ self from the bands of thy neck , O captive daughter of Z@@ ion .
thy watch@@ men shall lift up the voice ; with the voice together shall they sing : for they shall see eye to eye , when the LORD shall bring again Z@@ ion .
as many were aston@@ ied at thee ; his vis@@ age was so mar@@ red more than any man , and his form more than the sons of men :
so shall he sprink@@ le many nations ; the kings shall shut their mouths at him : for that which had not been told them shall they see ; and that which they had not heard shall they consider .
he is desp@@ ised and rejected of men ; a man of sor@@ rows , and acquainted with grief : and we hid as it were our faces from him ; he was desp@@ ised , and we este@@ em@@ ed him not .
surely he hath borne our gri@@ efs , and carried our sor@@ rows : yet we did esteem him stricken , sm@@ it@@ ten of God , and afflicted .
he was oppressed , and he was afflicted , yet he opened not his mouth : he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter , and as a sheep before her sh@@ ear@@ ers is dumb , so he open@@ eth not his mouth .
he shall see of the trav@@ ail of his soul , and shall be satisfied : by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many ; for he shall bear their ini@@ qu@@ ities .
enlarge the place of thy tent , and let them stretch forth the curtains of th@@ ine hab@@ itations : spare not , leng@@ then thy cor@@ ds , and strengthen thy stakes ;
fear not ; for thou shalt not be ashamed : neither be thou conf@@ ounded ; for thou shalt not be put to shame : for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth , and shalt not remember the repro@@ ach of thy wi@@ do@@ wh@@ ood any more .
behold , they shall surely gather together , but not by me : wh@@ oso@@ ever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake .
let the wicked for@@ sake his way , and the un@@ righteous man his thoughts : and let him return unto the LORD , and he will have mercy upon him ; and to our God , for he will ab@@ und@@ antly pardon .
blessed is the man that do@@ eth this , and the son of man that lay@@ eth hold on it ; that keep@@ eth the sab@@ bath from poll@@ uting it , and keep@@ eth his hand from doing any evil .
for he put on righteousness as a breast@@ plate , and an helmet of salvation upon his head ; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing , and was cl@@ ad with zeal as a clo@@ ke .
who are these that fly as a cloud , and as the d@@ oves to their windows ?
violence shall no more be heard in thy land , wasting nor destruction within thy borders ; but thou shalt call thy walls Sal@@ vation , and thy gates P@@ raise .
thy sun shall no more go down ; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself : for the LORD shall be th@@ ine everlasting light , and the days of thy mourning shall be ended .
for your shame ye shall have double ; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion : therefore in their land they shall possess the double : everlasting joy shall be unto them .
W@@ herefore art thou red in th@@ ine app@@ arel , and thy garments like him that t@@ read@@ eth in the win@@ ef@@ at ?
then he remembered the days of old , Moses , and his people , saying , Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock ? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him ?
look down from heaven , and behold from the hab@@ itation of thy hol@@ iness and of thy glory : where is thy zeal and thy strength , the sounding of thy bow@@ els and of thy mer@@ cies toward me ? are they restrained ?
doub@@ tless thou art our father , though Abraham be ignorant of us , and Israel acknowledge us not : thou , O LORD , art our father , our re@@ deem@@ er ; thy name is from everlasting .
as when the melting fire bur@@ neth , the fire caus@@ eth the waters to boil , to make thy name known to th@@ ine adversaries , that the nations may trem@@ ble at thy presence !
for since the beginning of the world men have not heard , nor perceived by the ear , neither hath the eye seen , O God , beside thee , what he hath prepared for him that wa@@ it@@ eth for him .
and there is none that call@@ eth upon thy name , that stir@@ re@@ th up himself to take hold of thee : for thou hast hid thy face from us , and hast consumed us , because of our ini@@ qu@@ ities .
that he who bl@@ ess@@ eth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth ; and he that swe@@ areth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth ; because the former troubles are forgotten , and because they are hid from mine eyes .
a voice of noise from the city , a voice from the temple , a voice of the LORD that ren@@ der@@ eth re@@ comp@@ ence to his enemies .
for , lo , I will call all the families of the king@@ doms of the north , sa@@ ith the LORD ; and they shall come , and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem , and against all the walls thereof round about , and against all the cities of Jud@@ ah .
and they shall fight against thee ; but they shall not prevail against thee ; for I am with thee , sa@@ ith the LORD , to deliver thee .
go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem , saying , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD ; I remember thee , the kindness of thy youth , the love of th@@ ine esp@@ ous@@ als , when thou w@@ ent@@ est after me in the wilderness , in a land that was not s@@ own .
hath a nation changed their gods , which are yet no gods ? but my people have changed their glory for that which do@@ th not profit .
hast thou not proc@@ ured this unto thy@@ self , in that thou hast for@@ s@@ aken the LORD thy God , when he led thee by the way ?
with@@ hold thy foot from being un@@ sh@@ od , and thy throat from thirst : but thou s@@ ai@@ d@@ st , There is no hope : no ; for I have loved strangers , and after them will I go .
but where are thy gods that thou hast made thee ? let them arise , if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble : for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods , O Jud@@ ah .
can a maid forget her ornam@@ ents , or a bride her at@@ tire ? yet my people have forgotten me days without number .
lift up th@@ ine eyes unto the high places , and see where thou hast not been li@@ en with . in the ways hast thou sat for them , as the Arabian in the wilderness ; and thou hast polluted the land with thy wh@@ ore@@ doms and with thy w@@ ick@@ edness .
and yet for all this her treach@@ erous sister Jud@@ ah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart , but fe@@ ig@@ ne@@ dly , sa@@ ith the LORD .
surely as a wife treach@@ er@@ ously depart@@ eth from her husband , so have ye dealt treach@@ er@@ ously with me , O house of Israel , sa@@ ith the LORD .
we lie down in our shame , and our confusion cover@@ eth us : for we have sin@@ ned against the LORD our God , we and our fathers , from our youth even unto this day , and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God .
circum@@ c@@ ise yourselves to the LORD , and take away the fores@@ kins of your heart , ye men of Jud@@ ah and inhabitants of Jerusalem : lest my fury come forth like fire , and burn that none can qu@@ en@@ ch it , because of the evil of your do@@ ings .
the lion is come up from his th@@ icket , and the destro@@ yer of the Genti@@ les is on his way ; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land des@@ ol@@ ate ; and thy cities shall be laid waste , without an inhabit@@ ant .
therefore I said , Su@@ rely these are poor ; they are foolish : for they know not the way of the LORD , nor the judgment of their God .
W@@ herefore thus sa@@ ith the LORD God of hosts , Because ye speak this word , behold , I will make my words in thy mouth fire , and this people wood , and it shall dev@@ our them .
and they shall eat up th@@ ine harvest , and thy bread , which thy sons and thy daughters should eat : they shall eat up thy f@@ locks and th@@ ine herds : they shall eat up thy v@@ ines and thy fi@@ g trees : they shall impover@@ ish thy f@@ enced cities , where@@ in thou trust@@ ed@@ st , with the sword .
neither say they in their heart , Let us now fear the LORD our God , that gi@@ v@@ eth rain , both the former and the latter , in his season : he reserv@@ eth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest .
as a fountain cast@@ eth out her waters , so she cast@@ eth out her w@@ ick@@ edness : violence and spoil is heard in her ; before me continually is grief and wounds .
hear , O earth : behold , I will bring evil upon this people , even the fruit of their thoughts , because they have not hear@@ k@@ ened unto my words , nor to my law , but rejected it .
I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people , that thou may@@ est know and try their way .
do they provoke me to anger ? sa@@ ith the LORD : do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces ?
for the children of Jud@@ ah have done evil in my sight , sa@@ ith the LORD : they have set their ab@@ om@@ inations in the house which is called by my name , to poll@@ ute it .
and they have built the high places of T@@ oph@@ et , which is in the valley of the son of H@@ inno@@ m , to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire ; which I commanded them not , neither came it into my heart .
ye@@ a , the stor@@ k in the heaven know@@ eth her appointed times ; and the tur@@ tle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming ; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD .
and they bend their tongues like their bow for lies : but they are not val@@ i@@ ant for the truth upon the earth ; for they proceed from evil to evil , and they know not me , sa@@ ith the LORD .
every man is bru@@ tish in his knowledge : every founder is conf@@ ounded by the gra@@ ven image : for his mol@@ ten image is false@@ hood , and there is no breath in them .
w@@ oe is me for my hurt ! my wound is griev@@ ous : but I said , Tru@@ ly this is a grief , and I must bear it .
my tab@@ ern@@ acle is spoiled , and all my cor@@ ds are broken : my children are gone forth of me , and they are not : there is none to stretch forth my tent any more , and to set up my curtains .
therefore pray not thou for this people , neither lift up a cry or prayer for them : for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble .
but thou , O LORD , know@@ est me : thou hast seen me , and tried mine heart toward thee : pull them out like sheep for the slaughter , and prepare them for the day of slaughter .
can the Ethiopian change his skin , or the le@@ op@@ ard his spots ? then may ye also do good , that are accustomed to do evil .
I have seen th@@ ine adul@@ ter@@ ies , and thy neigh@@ ings , the le@@ w@@ dness of thy wh@@ ore@@ dom , and th@@ ine ab@@ om@@ inations on the hills in the fields . w@@ oe unto thee , O Jerusalem ! wil@@ t thou not be made clean ? when shall it once be ?
thus sa@@ ith the LORD unto this people , Th@@ us have they loved to wander , they have not ref@@ rained their feet , therefore the LORD do@@ th not accept them ; he will now remember their ini@@ qu@@ ity , and visit their sins .
do not abh@@ or us , for thy name 's sake , do not dis@@ grace the throne of thy glory : remember , break not thy covenant with us .
are there any among the van@@ ities of the Genti@@ les that can cause rain ? or can the heavens give showers ? art not thou he , O LORD our God ? therefore we will wait upon thee : for thou hast made all these things .
then said the LORD unto me , Th@@ ough Moses and Samuel stood before me , yet my mind could not be toward this people : cast them out of my sight , and let them go forth .
thou hast for@@ s@@ aken me , sa@@ ith the LORD , thou art gone backward : therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee , and destroy thee ; I am weary with rep@@ enting .
and I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I will ber@@ e@@ ave them of children , I will destroy my people , since they return not from their ways .
thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price , and that for all thy sins , even in all thy borders .
O LORD , thou know@@ est : remember me , and visit me , and revenge me of my persec@@ utors ; take me not away in thy long@@ suffering : know that for thy sake I have suffered rebu@@ ke .
thy words were found , and I did eat them ; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejo@@ icing of mine heart : for I am called by thy name , O LORD God of hosts .
and I will make thee unto this people a f@@ enced br@@ as@@ en wall : and they shall fight against thee , but they shall not prevail against thee : for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee , sa@@ ith the LORD .
and first I will re@@ comp@@ ense their ini@@ qu@@ ity and their sin double ; because they have de@@ filed my land , they have filled mine inheritance with the car@@ cases of their det@@ est@@ able and ab@@ om@@ in@@ able things .
whilst their children remember their al@@ t@@ ars and their gro@@ ves by the green trees upon the high hills .
O my mountain in the field , I will give thy substance and all thy treasures to the spoil , and thy high places for sin , throughout all thy borders .
as for me , I have not ha@@ st@@ ened from being a pastor to follow thee : neither have I desired the wo@@ eful day ; thou know@@ est : that which came out of my lips was right before thee .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; Take heed to yourselves , and bear no burden on the sab@@ bath day , nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem ;
if that nation , against whom I have pronounced , turn from their evil , I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them .
yet , LORD , thou know@@ est all their counsel against me to sl@@ ay me : forgive not their ini@@ qu@@ ity , neither b@@ lot out their sin from thy sight , but let them be overthrown before thee ; deal thus with them in the time of th@@ ine anger .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Go and get a pot@@ ter 's ear@@ then bottle , and take of the anci@@ ents of the people , and of the anci@@ ents of the priests ;
and thou , Pash@@ ur , and all that dwell in th@@ ine house shall go into cap@@ tivity : and thou shalt come to Babylon , and there thou shalt die , and shalt be buried there , thou , and all thy friends , to whom thou hast prophe@@ si@@ ed lies .
then they shall answer , Because they have for@@ s@@ aken the covenant of the LORD their God , and wor@@ shipped other gods , and served them .
we@@ ep ye not for the dead , neither b@@ emo@@ an him : but we@@ ep sore for him that go@@ eth away : for he shall return no more , nor see his native country .
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD touching Sh@@ all@@ um the son of Jo@@ si@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , which re@@ igned instead of Jo@@ si@@ ah his father , which went forth out of this place ; He shall not return thi@@ ther any more :
that sa@@ ith , I will build me a wide house and large chambers , and cut@@ t@@ eth him out windows ; and it is ci@@ eled with c@@ edar , and painted with ver@@ mil@@ ion .
go up to Lebanon , and cry ; and lift up thy voice in Bash@@ an , and cry from the passages : for all thy lovers are destroyed .
I sp@@ ake unto thee in thy prosperity ; but thou s@@ ai@@ d@@ st , I will not hear . this hath been thy manner from thy youth , that thou obey@@ ed@@ st not my voice .
the wind shall eat up all thy past@@ ors , and thy lovers shall go into cap@@ tivity : surely then shalt thou be ashamed and conf@@ ounded for all thy w@@ ick@@ edness .
w@@ oe be unto the past@@ ors that destroy and sc@@ atter the sheep of my past@@ ure ! sa@@ ith the LORD .
which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour , as their fathers have forgotten my name for Ba@@ al .
therefore , behold , I , even I , will utterly forget you , and I will for@@ sake you , and the city that I gave you and your fathers , and cast you out of my presence :
and I will give them an heart to know me , that I am the LORD : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God : for they shall return unto me with their whole heart .
and the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets , rising early and sending them ; but ye have not hear@@ k@@ ened , nor inclined your ear to hear .
they said , Turn ye again now every one from his evil way , and from the evil of your do@@ ings , and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever :
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD God of Israel unto me ; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand , and cause all the nations , to whom I send thee , to drink it .
and it shall be , if they refuse to take the cup at th@@ ine hand to drink , then shalt thou say unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts ; Y@@ e shall certainly drink .
if so be they will hear@@ ken , and turn every man from his evil way , that I may repent me of the evil , which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their do@@ ings .
as for me , behold , I am in your hand : do with me as seem@@ eth good and meet unto you .
but know ye for certain , that if ye put me to death , ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves , and upon this city , and upon the inhabitants thereof : for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD to me ; Make thee bonds and y@@ okes , and put them upon thy neck ,
because they have committed vill@@ any in Israel , and have committed adul@@ tery with their neighbours ' wives , and have spoken lying words in my name , which I have not commanded them ; even I know , and am a witness , sa@@ ith the LORD .
thus spe@@ ak@@ eth the LORD God of Israel , saying , Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book .
for it shall come to pass in that day , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , that I will break his y@@ oke from off thy neck , and will burst thy bonds , and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him :
but they shall serve the LORD their God , and David their king , whom I will raise up unto them .
for I am with thee , sa@@ ith the LORD , to save thee : though I make a full end of all nations whi@@ ther I have scattered thee , yet will I not make a full end of thee : but I will correct thee in measure , and will not leave thee altogether un@@ punished .
there is none to ple@@ ad thy cause , that thou may@@ est be bound up : thou hast no healing medicines .
why cri@@ est thou for th@@ ine afflic@@ tion ? thy sorrow is incur@@ able for the multitude of th@@ ine ini@@ qu@@ ity : because thy sins were increased , I have done these things unto thee .
and their no@@ bles shall be of themselves , and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them ; and I will cause him to draw near , and he shall approach unto me : for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me ? sa@@ ith the LORD .
hear the word of the LORD , O ye nations , and declare it in the is@@ les af@@ ar off , and say , He that scattered Israel will gather him , and keep him , as a shepherd do@@ th his flock .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; A voice was heard in Ram@@ ah , lam@@ entation , and bitter we@@ eping ; Rah@@ el we@@ eping for her children refused to be comfor@@ ted for her children , because they were not .
but every one shall die for his own ini@@ qu@@ ity : every man that e@@ at@@ eth the sour grap@@ e , his teeth shall be set on edge .
Ah Lord GO@@ D ! behold , thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm , and there is nothing too hard for thee :
for the children of Israel and the children of Jud@@ ah have only done evil before me from their youth : for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands , sa@@ ith the LORD .
for this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
but they set their ab@@ om@@ inations in the house , which is called by my name , to def@@ ile it .
behold , I will gather them out of all countries , whi@@ ther I have driven them in mine anger , and in my fury , and in great wrath ; and I will bring them again unto this place , and I will cause them to dwell safely :
and I will give them one heart , and one way , that they may fear me for ever , for the good of them , and of their children after them :
ye@@ a , I will rejoice over them to do them good , and I will plant them in this land assu@@ re@@ dly with my whole heart and with my whole soul .
that every man should let his man@@ servant , and every man his mai@@ d@@ servant , being an Hebrew or an He@@ bre@@ w@@ ess , go free ; that none should serve himself of them , to w@@ it , of a Jew his brother .
and ye were now turned , and had done right in my sight , in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour ; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name :
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Go and tell the men of Jud@@ ah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , Will ye not receive instruction to hear@@ ken to my words ? sa@@ ith the LORD .
it may be that the house of Jud@@ ah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them ; that they may return every man from his evil way ; that I may forgive their ini@@ qu@@ ity and their sin .
yet they were not afraid , nor rent their garments , neither the king , nor any of his servants that heard all these words .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , the God of Israel ; Th@@ us shall ye say to the king of Jud@@ ah , that sent you unto me to inqu@@ ire of me ; Be@@ hold , Phar@@ aoh 's army , which is come forth to help you , shall return to Egypt into their own land .
so E@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ m@@ elec@@ h took the men with him , and went into the house of the king under the treasury , and took th@@ ence old cast cl@@ outs and old ro@@ tten r@@ ags , and let them down by cor@@ ds into the dun@@ geon to Jer@@ emi@@ ah .
then Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the king sent , and took Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD : and the king said unto Jer@@ emi@@ ah , I will ask thee a thing ; hide nothing from me .
so Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the king sw@@ are secretly unto Jer@@ emi@@ ah , saying , As the LORD liv@@ eth , that made us this soul , I will not put thee to death , neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life .
so they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chal@@ de@@ ans : and thou shalt not escape out of their hand , but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon : and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire .
in the ninth year of Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , in the tenth month , came Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem , and they bes@@ e@@ ig@@ ed it .
then called he Johan@@ an the son of Kare@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces which were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
and say unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Be@@ hold , I will send and take Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ zz@@ ar the king of Babylon , my servant , and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid ; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them .
they are not hum@@ bled even unto this day , neither have they feared , nor walked in my law , nor in my statutes , that I set before you and before your fathers .
thou did@@ st say , W@@ oe is me now ! for the LORD hath added grief to my sorrow ; I fain@@ ted in my sigh@@ ing , and I find no rest .
fear thou not , O Jacob my servant , sa@@ ith the LORD : for I am with thee ; for I will make a full end of all the nations whi@@ ther I have driven thee : but I will not make a full end of thee , but correct thee in measure ; yet will I not leave thee wholly un@@ punished .
at the noise of the stam@@ ping of the hoo@@ fs of his strong horses , at the rushing of his ch@@ ari@@ ots , and at the rum@@ bling of his wheels , the fathers shall not look back to their children for fee@@ bl@@ eness of hands ;
Mo@@ ab hath been at ease from his youth , and he hath settled on his le@@ es , and hath not been emp@@ tied from vessel to vessel , neither hath he gone into cap@@ tivity : therefore his taste remained in him , and his scent is not changed .
O vine of Sib@@ ma@@ h , I will we@@ ep for thee with the we@@ eping of J@@ az@@ er : thy plants are gone over the sea , they reach even to the sea of J@@ az@@ er : the spo@@ iler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy v@@ intage .
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; Be@@ hold , he shall fly as an eagle , and shall spread his wings over Mo@@ ab .
W@@ herefore glori@@ est thou in the valleys , thy flowing valley , O back@@ sliding daughter ? that trusted in her treasures , saying , Who shall come unto me ?
leave thy fa@@ ther@@ less children , I will preserve them alive ; and let thy wid@@ ows trust in me .
my people hath been lost sheep : their shep@@ herds have caused them to go astr@@ ay , they have turned them away on the mountains : they have gone from mountain to hill , they have forgotten their rest@@ ing@@ place .
all that found them have dev@@ oured them : and their adversaries said , We offend not , because they have sin@@ ned against the LORD , the hab@@ itation of justice , even the LORD , the hope of their fathers .
cut off the s@@ ower from Babylon , and him that hand@@ let@@ h the sick@@ le in the time of harvest : for fear of the op@@ pressing sword they shall turn every one to his people , and they shall flee every one to his own land .
I have laid a sn@@ are for thee , and thou art also taken , O Babylon , and thou w@@ ast not aware : thou art found , and also caught , because thou hast stri@@ ven against the LORD .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and deliver every man his soul : be not cut off in her ini@@ qu@@ ity ; for this is the time of the LORD 's vengeance ; he will render unto her a re@@ comp@@ ence .
the LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself , saying , Su@@ rely I will fill thee with men , as with cat@@ er@@ pill@@ ers ; and they shall lift up a shout against thee .
every man is bru@@ tish by his knowledge ; every founder is conf@@ ounded by the gra@@ ven image : for his mol@@ ten image is false@@ hood , and there is no breath in them .
behold , I am against thee , O destroying mountain , sa@@ ith the LORD , which destro@@ y@@ est all the earth : and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee , and roll thee down from the rocks , and will make thee a burnt mountain .
the mighty men of Babylon have for@@ born to fight , they have remained in their holds : their might hath failed ; they became as women : they have burned her dwell@@ ing@@ places ; her bars are broken .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; Be@@ hold , I will ple@@ ad thy cause , and take vengeance for thee ; and I will dry up her sea , and make her springs dry .
though Babylon should mount up to heaven , and though she should forti@@ fy the height of her strength , yet from me shall spo@@ il@@ ers come unto her , sa@@ ith the LORD .
and changed his prison garments : and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life .
all her people sigh , they seek bread ; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul : see , O LORD , and consider ; for I am become v@@ ile .
Z@@ ion spread@@ eth forth her hands , and there is none to comfort her : the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob , that his adversaries should be round about him : Jerusalem is as a menstr@@ uous woman among them .
I called for my lovers , but they deceived me : my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city , while they sought their meat to relieve their souls .
they say to their mothers , Where is corn and wine ? when they sw@@ o@@ oned as the wounded in the streets of the city , when their soul was poured out into their mothers ' bos@@ om .
all th@@ ine enemies have opened their mouth against thee : they h@@ iss and gn@@ ash the teeth : they say , We have swallowed her up : certainly this is the day that we looked for ; we have found , we have seen it .
their heart cried unto the Lord , O wall of the daughter of Z@@ ion , let tears run down like a river day and night : give thy@@ self no rest ; let not the apple of th@@ ine eye cease .
he hath hed@@ ged me about , that I C@@ AN@@ NOT get out : he hath made my chain heavy .
it is good for a man that he bear the y@@ oke in his youth .
to crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth ,
W@@ herefore do@@ th a living man complain , a man for the punishment of his sins ?
all our enemies have opened their mouths against us .
waters flowed over mine head ; then I said , I am cut off .
thou hast heard my voice : hide not th@@ ine ear at my breathing , at my cry .
O Lord , thou hast ple@@ aded the causes of my soul ; thou hast re@@ deemed my life .
the hands of the p@@ iti@@ ful women have so@@ dden their own children : they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
the punishment of th@@ ine ini@@ qu@@ ity is accomplished , O daughter of Z@@ ion ; he will no more carry thee away into cap@@ tivity : he will visit th@@ ine ini@@ qu@@ ity , O daughter of E@@ dom ; he will discover thy sins .
we G@@ at our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness .
turn thou us unto thee , O LORD , and we shall be turned ; renew our days as of old .
and they went every one straight forward : whi@@ ther the spirit was to go , they went ; and they turned not when they went .
and thou , son of man , be not afraid of them , neither be afraid of their words , though bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns be with thee , and thou d@@ ost dwell among scor@@ pi@@ ons : be not afraid of their words , nor be dis@@ may@@ ed at their looks , though they be a rebelli@@ ous house .
not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language , whose words thou can@@ st not understand . surely , had I sent thee to them , they would have hear@@ k@@ ened unto thee .
then the spirit took me up , and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing , saying , Bless@@ ed be the glory of the LORD from his place .
yet if thou warn the wicked , and he turn not from his w@@ ick@@ edness , nor from his wicked way , he shall die in his ini@@ qu@@ ity ; but thou hast delivered thy soul .
nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man , that the righteous sin not , and he do@@ th not sin , he shall surely live , because he is warned ; also thou hast delivered thy soul .
then I arose , and went forth into the plain : and , behold , the glory of the LORD stood there , as the glory which I saw by the river of Che@@ bar : and I fell on my face .
then the spirit entered into me , and set me upon my feet , and sp@@ ake with me , and said unto me , Go , shut thy@@ self within th@@ ine house .
but thou , O son of man , behold , they shall put bands upon thee , and shall bind thee with them , and thou shalt not go out among them :
thou also , son of man , take thee a tile , and lay it before thee , and p@@ our@@ tray upon it the city , even Jerusalem :
and when thou hast accomplished them , lie again on thy right side , and thou shalt bear the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the house of Jud@@ ah forty days : I have appointed thee each day for a year .
and , behold , I will lay bands upon thee , and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another , till thou hast ended the days of thy siege .
and the LORD said , Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their de@@ filed bread among the Genti@@ les , whi@@ ther I will drive them .
that they may want bread and water , and be aston@@ ied one with another , and consume away for their ini@@ qu@@ ity .
and thou , son of man , take thee a sharp knife , take thee a bar@@ ber 's r@@ as@@ or , and cause it to pass upon th@@ ine head and upon thy beard : then take thee balances to weight , and divide the hair .
thou shalt also take thereof a few in number , and bind them in thy skirts .
and she hath changed my judgments into w@@ ick@@ edness more than the nations , and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her : for they have refused my judgments and my statutes , they have not walked in them .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Be@@ hold , I , even I , am against thee , and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations .
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments in thee , and the whole remn@@ ant of thee will I sc@@ atter into all the winds .
thus shall mine anger be accomplished , and I will cause my fury to rest upon them , and I will be comfor@@ ted : and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal , when I have accomplished my fury in them .
now is the end come upon thee , and I will send mine anger upon thee , and will judge thee according to thy ways , and will re@@ comp@@ ense upon thee all th@@ ine ab@@ om@@ inations .
now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee , and accomplish mine anger upon thee : and I will judge thee according to thy ways , and will re@@ comp@@ ense thee for all th@@ ine ab@@ om@@ inations .
therefore will I also deal in fury : mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice , yet will I not hear them .
he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice , saying , C@@ ause them that have charge over the city to draw near , even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand .
and it came to pass , while they were sl@@ aying them , and I was left , that I fell upon my face , and cried , and said , Ah Lord GO@@ D ! wil@@ t thou destroy all the resi@@ due of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem ?
and one cher@@ u@@ b stretched forth his hand from between the cher@@ ub@@ ims unto the fire that was between the cher@@ ub@@ ims , and took thereof , and put it into the hands of him that was clo@@ thed with linen : who took it , and went out .
and when the cher@@ ub@@ ims went , the wheels went by them : and when the cher@@ ub@@ ims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth , the same wheels also turned not from beside them .
dig thou through the wall in their sight , and carry out thereby .
because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the wicked , that he should not return from his wicked way , by promising him life :
then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me , and sat before me .
son of man , these men have set up their idols in their heart , and put the stum@@ bl@@ ing@@ block of their ini@@ qu@@ ity before their face : should I be inqui@@ red of at all by them ?
that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart , because they are all e@@ strang@@ ed from me through their idols .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem , the sword , and the famine , and the nois@@ ome beast , and the pesti@@ l@@ ence , to cut off from it man and beast ?
none eye p@@ iti@@ ed thee , to do any of these unto thee , to have compassion upon thee ; but thou w@@ ast cast out in the open field , to the lo@@ thing of thy person , in the day that thou w@@ ast born .
and I put a je@@ wel on thy forehead , and ear@@ rings in th@@ ine ears , and a beautiful crown upon th@@ ine head .
and thy renow@@ n went forth among the he@@ a@@ then for thy beauty : for it was perfect through my com@@ eliness , which I had put upon thee , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters , whom thou hast borne unto me , and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be dev@@ oured . is this of thy wh@@ ore@@ doms a small matter ,
and in all th@@ ine ab@@ om@@ inations and thy wh@@ ore@@ doms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth , when thou w@@ ast naked and bare , and w@@ ast polluted in thy blood .
and it came to pass after all thy w@@ ick@@ edness , ( w@@ oe , w@@ oe unto thee ! sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; )
in that thou buil@@ dest th@@ ine eminent place in the head of every way , and mak@@ est th@@ ine high place in every street ; and hast not been as an har@@ lot , in that thou scor@@ nest hire ;
they give gifts to all wh@@ ores : but thou gi@@ v@@ est thy gifts to all thy lovers , and hi@@ rest them , that they may come unto thee on every side for thy wh@@ ore@@ dom .
so will I make my fury toward thee to rest , and my jealousy shall depart from thee , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
thou art thy mother 's daughter , that lo@@ the@@ th her husband and her children ; and thou art the sister of thy sisters , which lo@@ thed their husbands and their children : your mother was an Hit@@ tite , and your father an A@@ mor@@ ite .
and th@@ ine elder sister is Sam@@ aria , she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand : and thy younger sister , that dwell@@ eth at thy right hand , is So@@ dom and her daughters .
yet hast thou not walked after their ways , nor done after their ab@@ om@@ inations : but , as if that were a very little thing , thou w@@ ast corrupted more than they in all thy ways .
behold , this was the ini@@ qu@@ ity of thy sister So@@ dom , pride , fulness of bread , and abundance of id@@ l@@ eness was in her and in her daughters , neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and ne@@ edy .
neither hath Sam@@ aria committed half of thy sins ; but thou hast multiplied th@@ ine ab@@ om@@ inations more than they , and hast justified thy sisters in all th@@ ine ab@@ om@@ inations which thou hast done .
for thy sister So@@ dom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride ,
nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth , and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant .
then thou shalt remember thy ways , and be ashamed , when thou shalt receive thy sisters , th@@ ine elder and thy younger : and I will give them unto thee for daughters , but not by thy covenant .
there was also another great eagle with great wings and many fe@@ athers : and , behold , this vine did bend her roots toward him , and shot forth her branches toward him , that he might water it by the fur@@ rows of her plantation .
say now to the rebelli@@ ous house , Know ye not what these things mean ? tell them , Be@@ hold , the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem , and hath taken the king thereof , and the princes thereof , and led them with him to Babylon ;
and hath taken of the king 's seed , and made a covenant with him , and hath taken an oath of him : he hath also taken the mighty of the land :
but he reb@@ elled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt , that they might give him horses and much people . shall he prosper ? shall he escape that do@@ eth such things ? or shall he break the covenant , and be delivered ?
seeing he desp@@ ised the oath by breaking the covenant , when , lo , he had given his hand , and hath done all these things , he shall not escape .
and hath not eaten upon the mountains , neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , neither hath de@@ filed his neighbour 's wife , neither hath come near to a menstr@@ uous woman ,
he that hath not given forth upon us@@ ury , neither hath taken any increase , that hath withdrawn his hand from ini@@ qu@@ ity , hath executed true judgment between man and man ,
that hath taken off his hand from the poor , that hath not received us@@ ury nor increase , hath executed my judgments , hath walked in my statutes ; he shall not die for the ini@@ qu@@ ity of his father , he shall surely live .
but if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die ? sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D : and not that he should return from his ways , and live ?
again , when the wicked man tur@@ neth away from his w@@ ick@@ edness that he hath committed , and do@@ eth that which is lawful and right , he shall save his soul alive .
because he consider@@ eth , and tur@@ neth away from all his trans@@ gres@@ sions that he hath committed , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
yet sa@@ ith the house of Israel , The way of the Lord is not equal . O house of Israel , are not my ways equal ? are not your ways unequal ?
cast away from you all your trans@@ gres@@ sions , whereby ye have trans@@ g@@ ressed ; and make you a new heart and a new spirit : for why will ye die , O house of Israel ?
now when she saw that she had waited , and her hope was lost , then she took another of her whel@@ ps , and made him a young lion .
and she had strong rods for the sc@@ ept@@ res of them that bare rule , and her stature was exalted among the thick branches , and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches .
because they had not executed my judgments , but had desp@@ ised my statutes , and had polluted my sab@@ baths , and their eyes were after their fathers ' idols .
W@@ herefore say unto the house of Israel , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers ? and commit ye wh@@ ore@@ dom after their ab@@ om@@ inations ?
thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Remove the di@@ ad@@ em , and take off the crown : this shall not be the same : ex@@ alt him that is low , and ab@@ ase him that is high .
and I will pour out mine indignation upon thee , I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath , and deliver thee into the hand of bru@@ tish men , and sk@@ il@@ ful to destroy .
then say thou , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D , The city sh@@ ed@@ det@@ h blood in the midst of it , that her time may come , and mak@@ eth idols against herself to def@@ ile herself .
behold , the princes of Israel , every one were in thee to their power to shed blood .
in thee have they discovered their fathers ' n@@ ak@@ edness : in thee have they hum@@ bled her that was set apart for pollution .
behold , therefore I have sm@@ it@@ ten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made , and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee .
and I will sc@@ atter thee among the he@@ a@@ then , and disper@@ se thee in the countries , and will consume thy fil@@ thiness out of thee .
and A@@ hol@@ ah played the har@@ lot when she was mine ; and she do@@ ted on her lovers , on the As@@ sy@@ rians her neighbours ,
and that she increased her wh@@ ore@@ doms : for when she saw men p@@ our@@ tr@@ ayed upon the wall , the images of the Chal@@ de@@ ans p@@ our@@ tr@@ ayed with ver@@ mil@@ ion ,
and as soon as she saw them with her eyes , she do@@ ted upon them , and sent messengers unto them into Chal@@ dea .
so she discovered her wh@@ ore@@ doms , and discovered her n@@ ak@@ edness : then my mind was alienated from her , like as my mind was alienated from her sister .
there , O A@@ hol@@ i@@ ba@@ h , thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Be@@ hold , I will raise up thy lovers against thee , from whom thy mind is alienated , and I will bring them against thee on every side ;
thus will I make thy le@@ w@@ dness to cease from thee , and thy wh@@ ore@@ dom brought from the land of Egypt : so that thou shalt not lift up th@@ ine eyes unto them , nor remember Egypt any more .
and they shall deal with thee hat@@ efully , and shall take away all thy labour , and shall leave thee naked and bare : and the n@@ ak@@ edness of thy wh@@ ore@@ doms shall be discovered , both thy le@@ w@@ dness and thy wh@@ ore@@ doms .
thou shalt be filled with drun@@ ken@@ ness and sorrow , with the cup of aston@@ ishment and des@@ ol@@ ation , with the cup of thy sister Sam@@ aria .
for when they had sl@@ ain their children to their idols , then they came the same day into my sanctuary to prof@@ ane it ; and , lo , thus have they done in the midst of mine house .
son of man , write thee the name of the day , even of this same day : the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day .
in thy fil@@ thiness is le@@ w@@ dness : because I have pur@@ ged thee , and thou w@@ ast not pur@@ ged , thou shalt not be pur@@ ged from thy fil@@ thiness any more , till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee .
son of man , behold , I take away from thee the desire of th@@ ine eyes with a stroke : yet neither shalt thou mour@@ n nor we@@ ep , neither shall thy tears run down .
behold , therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession , and they shall set their palaces in thee , and make their dwell@@ ings in thee : they shall eat thy fruit , and they shall drink thy milk .
behold , therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee , and will deliver thee for a spoil to the he@@ a@@ then ; and I will cut thee off from the people , and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries : I will destroy thee ; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Be@@ hold , I am against thee , O Ty@@ rus , and will cause many nations to come up against thee , as the sea caus@@ eth his waves to come up .
he shall sl@@ ay with the sword thy daughters in the field : and he shall make a fort against thee , and cast a mount against thee , and lift up the Buck@@ ler against thee .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D to Ty@@ rus ; Sh@@ all not the is@@ les shake at the sound of thy fall , when the wounded cry , when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee ?
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; When I shall make thee a des@@ ol@@ ate city , like the cities that are not inhabited ; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee , and great waters shall cover thee ;
fine linen with bro@@ i@@ dered work from Egypt was that which thou spread@@ est forth to be thy sail ; blue and purple from the is@@ les of Elis@@ ha@@ h was that which covered thee .
the inhabitants of Z@@ id@@ on and Ar@@ v@@ ad were thy mar@@ in@@ ers : thy wise men , O Ty@@ rus , that were in thee , were thy pilots .
the anci@@ ents of Ge@@ bal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy cal@@ kers : all the ships of the sea with their mar@@ in@@ ers were in thee to occupy thy merchandise .
they of Persia and of Lu@@ d and of Phu@@ t were in th@@ ine army , thy men of war : they han@@ ged the shield and helmet in thee ; they set forth thy com@@ eliness .
the men of Ar@@ v@@ ad with th@@ ine army were upon thy walls round about , and the G@@ amm@@ ad@@ ims were in thy towers : they han@@ ged their shi@@ elds upon thy walls round about ; they have made thy beauty perfect .
by thy great wisdom and by thy traff@@ ick hast thou increased thy riches , and th@@ ine heart is lifted up because of thy riches :
behold , therefore I will bring strangers upon thee , the terrible of the nations : and they shall draw their s@@ words against the beauty of thy wisdom , and they shall def@@ ile thy brightness .
thou w@@ ast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou w@@ ast created , till ini@@ qu@@ ity was found in thee .
by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence , and thou hast sin@@ ned : therefore I will cast thee as prof@@ ane out of the mountain of God : and I will destroy thee , O covering cher@@ u@@ b , from the midst of the stones of fire .
he and his people with him , the terrible of the nations , shall be brought to destroy the land : and they shall draw their s@@ words against Egypt , and fill the land with the sl@@ ain .
thus was he fair in his greatness , in the length of his branches : for his root was by great waters .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people ; and they shall bring thee up in my net .
all the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee , and set darkness upon thy land , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
ye@@ a , I will make many people amazed at thee , and their kings shall be horri@@ bly afraid for thee , when I shall bran@@ dish my sword before them ; and they shall trem@@ ble at every moment , every man for his own life , in the day of thy fall .
Phar@@ aoh shall see them , and shall be comfor@@ ted over all his multitude , even Phar@@ aoh and all his army sl@@ ain by the sword , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
nevertheless , if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it ; if he do not turn from his way , he shall die in his ini@@ qu@@ ity ; but thou hast delivered thy soul .
say unto them , As I live , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D , I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked ; but that the wicked turn from his way and live : turn ye , turn ye from your evil ways ; for why will ye die , O house of Israel ?
again , when I say unto the wicked , Th@@ ou shalt surely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is lawful and right ;
when the righteous tur@@ neth from his righteousness , and commit@@ t@@ eth ini@@ qu@@ ity , he shall even die thereby .
but if the wicked turn from his w@@ ick@@ edness , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall live thereby .
as a shepherd see@@ ket@@ h out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered ; so will I seek out my sheep , and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day .
and ye my flock , the flock of my past@@ ure , are men , and I am your God , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
and say unto it , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Be@@ hold , O mount Se@@ ir , I am against thee , and I will stretch out mine hand against thee , and I will make thee most des@@ ol@@ ate .
I will make thee perpetual des@@ ol@@ ations , and thy cities shall not return : and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
and thou shalt know that I am the LORD , and that I have heard all thy bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel , saying , They are laid des@@ ol@@ ate , they are given us to consume .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; I have lifted up mine hand , Su@@ rely the he@@ a@@ then that are about you , they shall bear their shame .
neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the he@@ a@@ then any more , neither shalt thou bear the repro@@ ach of the people any more , neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
son of man , when the house of Israel d@@ wel@@ t in their own land , they de@@ filed it by their own way and by their do@@ ings : their way was before me as the un@@ clean@@ ness of a removed woman .
then shall ye remember your own evil ways , and your do@@ ings that were not good , and shall lo@@ the yourselves in your own sight for your ini@@ qu@@ ities and for your ab@@ om@@ inations .
and I will lay sin@@ ews upon you , and will bring up flesh upon you , and cover you with skin , and put breath in you , and ye shall live ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
and join them one to another into one stick ; and they shall become one in th@@ ine hand .
and I will turn thee back , and put hoo@@ ks into thy j@@ aws , and I will bring thee forth , and all th@@ ine army , horses and hor@@ sem@@ en , all of them clo@@ thed with all sorts of arm@@ our , even a great company with buck@@ lers and shi@@ elds , all of them handling s@@ words :
for in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken , Su@@ rely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel ;
and I will sm@@ ite thy bow out of thy left hand , and will cause th@@ ine arrows to fall out of thy right hand .
after that they have borne their shame , and all their t@@ resp@@ asses whereby they have t@@ resp@@ assed against me , when they d@@ wel@@ t safely in their land , and none made them afraid .
thou son of man , sh@@ ew the house to the house of Israel , that they may be ashamed of their ini@@ qu@@ ities : and let them measure the pattern .
and the altar shall be twelve cub@@ its long , twelve broad , square in the four squares thereof .
and ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things : but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves .
because they minist@@ ered unto them before their idols , and caused the house of Israel to fall into ini@@ qu@@ ity ; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D , and they shall bear their ini@@ qu@@ ity .
and they shall not come near unto me , to do the office of a priest unto me , nor to come near to any of my holy things , in the most holy place : but they shall bear their shame , and their ab@@ om@@ inations which they have committed .
they shall enter into my sanctuary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister unto me , and they shall keep my charge .
the ep@@ ha@@ h and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain the tenth part of an Hom@@ er , and the ep@@ ha@@ h the tenth part of an Hom@@ er : the measure thereof shall be after the Hom@@ er .
and upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bul@@ lock for a sin offering .
but Daniel pur@@ posed in his heart that he would not def@@ ile himself with the portion of the king 's meat , nor with the wine which he drank : therefore he requested of the prince of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s that he might not def@@ ile himself .
then Daniel went to his house , and made the thing known to Han@@ ani@@ ah , Mis@@ hael , and Az@@ ari@@ ah , his companions :
then the king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar fell upon his face , and wor@@ shipped Daniel , and commanded that they should offer an ob@@ lation and sweet od@@ ours unto him .
Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar sp@@ ake and said unto them , Is it true , O Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , M@@ esh@@ ach , and A@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ go , do not ye serve my gods , nor worship the golden image which I have set up ?
then these men were bound in their coats , their hos@@ en , and their hats , and their other garments , and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
then Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king was aston@@ ied , and rose up in ha@@ ste , and sp@@ ake , and said unto his counsel@@ lers , Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire ? they answered and said unto the king , True , O king .
I thought it good to sh@@ ew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me .
I Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar was at rest in mine house , and flourishing in my palace :
thus were the visions of mine head in my bed ; I saw , and behold a tree in the midst of the earth , and the height thereof was great .
I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed , and , behold , a wat@@ cher and an holy one came down from heaven ;
W@@ herefore , O king , let my counsel be acceptable unto thee , and break off thy sins by righteousness , and th@@ ine ini@@ qu@@ ities by sh@@ ew@@ ing mercy to the poor ; if it may be a leng@@ th@@ ening of thy tranqu@@ ill@@ ity .
then the king 's coun@@ tenance was changed , and his thoughts troubled him , so that the joints of his lo@@ ins were loos@@ ed , and his knees smo@@ te one against another .
then Daniel answered and said before the king , Let thy gifts be to thy@@ self , and give thy rewards to another ; yet I will read the writing unto the king , and make known to him the interpretation .
O thou king , the most high God gave Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar thy father a kingdom , and maj@@ esty , and glory , and honour :
but when his heart was lifted up , and his mind hardened in pride , he was de@@ posed from his kingly throne , and they took his glory from him :
then these men assembled , and found Daniel praying and making suppl@@ ication before his God .
and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den ; and the king sealed it with his own sig@@ net , and with the sig@@ net of his lords ; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel .
then was the king exceeding glad for him , and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . so Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no manner of hurt was found upon him , because he believed in his God .
in the first year of Bel@@ sha@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed : then he wrote the dream , and told the sum of the matters .
I Daniel was griev@@ ed in my spirit in the midst of my body , and the visions of my head troubled me .
and I prayed unto the LORD my God , and made my confession , and said , O Lord , the great and dreadful God , keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him , and to them that keep his commandments ;
neither have we hear@@ k@@ ened unto thy servants the prophets , which sp@@ ake in thy name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God , to walk in his laws , which he set before us by his servants the prophets .
and he hath confirmed his words , which he sp@@ ake against us , and against our judges that judged us , by bringing upon us a great evil : for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem .
and now , O Lord our God , that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and hast gotten thee renow@@ n , as at this day ; we have sin@@ ned , we have done w@@ ick@@ edly .
now therefore , O our God , hear the prayer of thy servant , and his suppl@@ ications , and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is des@@ ol@@ ate , for the Lord 's sake .
O Lord , hear ; O Lord , forgive ; O Lord , hear@@ ken and do ; def@@ er not , for th@@ ine own sake , O my God : for thy city and thy people are called by thy name .
and , behold , an hand touched me , which set me upon my knees and upon the pal@@ ms of my hands .
now I am come to make thee understand what shall be@@ fall thy people in the latter days : for yet the vision is for many days .
then shall he return into his land with great riches ; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant ; and he shall do exploits , and return to his own land .
he shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries : and the land of Egypt shall not escape .
and he shall plant the tab@@ ern@@ acles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain ; yet he shall come to his end , and none shall help him .
ple@@ ad with your mother , ple@@ ad : for she is not my wife , neither am I her husband : let her therefore put away her wh@@ ore@@ doms out of her sight , and her adul@@ ter@@ ies from between her breasts ;
therefore , behold , I will hedge up thy way with thor@@ ns , and make a wall , that she shall not find her paths .
and I will give her her vineyards from th@@ ence , and the valley of Ach@@ or for a door of hope : and she shall sing there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
I will even bet@@ ro@@ th thee unto me in faith@@ fulness : and thou shalt know the LORD .
and I will sow her unto me in the earth ; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy ; and I will say to them which were not my people , Th@@ ou art my people ; and they shall say , Th@@ ou art my God .
and I said unto her , Th@@ ou shalt abide for me many days ; thou shalt not play the har@@ lot , and thou shalt not be for another man : so will I also be for thee .
my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge : because thou hast rejected knowledge , I will also reject thee , that thou shalt be no priest to me : seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God , I will also forget thy children .
my people ask counsel at their stocks , and their staff decla@@ re@@ th unto them : for the spirit of wh@@ ore@@ doms hath caused them to er@@ r , and they have gone a wh@@ oring from under their God .
and the pride of Israel do@@ th testify to his face : therefore shall Israel and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im fall in their ini@@ qu@@ ity ; Jud@@ ah also shall fall with them .
when E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im saw his sickness , and Jud@@ ah saw his wound , then went E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to the As@@ sy@@ rian , and sent to king J@@ are@@ b : yet could he not heal you , nor cure you of your wound .
and they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their w@@ ick@@ edness : now their own do@@ ings have bes@@ et them about ; they are before my face .
they make the king glad with their w@@ ick@@ edness , and the princes with their lies .
in the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine ; he stretched out his hand with scor@@ ners .
for they have made ready their heart like an oven , wh@@ iles they lie in wait : their b@@ aker sleep@@ eth all the night ; in the morning it bur@@ neth as a fl@@ aming fire .
and the pride of Israel testi@@ fi@@ eth to his face : and they do not return to the LORD their God , nor seek him for all this .
and they have not cried unto me with their heart , when they how@@ led upon their beds : they assemble themselves for corn and wine , and they rebel against me .
they return , but not to the most High : they are like a dece@@ it@@ ful bow : their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue : this shall be their deri@@ sion in the land of Egypt .
set the trum@@ pet to thy mouth . he shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD , because they have trans@@ g@@ ressed my covenant , and t@@ resp@@ assed against my law .
Israel shall cry unto me , My God , we know thee .
they have set up kings , but not by me : they have made princes , and I knew it not : of their silver and their gold have they made them idols , that they may be cut off .
for they are gone up to As@@ sy@@ ria , a wild ass alone by himself : E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im hath hired lovers .
sow to yourselves in righteousness , reap in mercy ; break up your f@@ allow ground : for it is time to seek the LORD , till he come and rain righteousness upon you .
ye have pl@@ owed w@@ ick@@ edness , ye have re@@ aped ini@@ qu@@ ity ; ye have eaten the fruit of lies : because thou did@@ st trust in thy way , in the multitude of thy mighty men .
I will be thy king : where is any other that may save thee in all thy cities ? and thy judges of whom thou s@@ ai@@ d@@ st , Gi@@ ve me a king and princes ?
lam@@ ent like a virgin gir@@ ded with s@@ ack@@ cloth for the husband of her youth .
the beasts of the field cry also unto thee : for the rivers of waters are dried up , and the fire hath dev@@ oured the past@@ ures of the wilderness .
they shall run like mighty men ; they shall climb the wall like men of war ; and they shall march every one on his ways , and they shall not break their ranks :
therefore also now , sa@@ ith the LORD , turn ye even to me with all your heart , and with fasting , and with we@@ eping , and with mourning :
gather the people , sancti@@ fy the congregation , assemble the elders , gather the children , and those that su@@ ck the breasts : let the bri@@ deg@@ room go forth of his chamber , and the bride out of her closet .
then will the LORD be jeal@@ ous for his land , and pity his people .
and I will sh@@ ew wonders in the heavens and in the earth , blood , and fire , and pillars of smoke .
so shall ye know that I am the LORD your God dwelling in Z@@ ion , my holy mountain : then shall Jerusalem be holy , and there shall no strangers pass through her any more .
for I will clean@@ se their blood that I have not cleans@@ ed : for the LORD dwell@@ eth in Z@@ ion .
can two walk together , except they be agreed ?
surely the Lord GO@@ D will do nothing , but he reve@@ al@@ eth his secret unto his servants the prophets .
for they know not to do right , sa@@ ith the LORD , who store up violence and robbery in their palaces .
take thou away from me the noise of thy songs ; for I will not hear the melody of thy vi@@ ols .
but ye have borne the tab@@ ern@@ acle of your Molo@@ ch and Chi@@ un your images , the star of your god , which ye made to yourselves .
and the LORD said unto me , A@@ mos , what se@@ est thou ? and I said , A plum@@ bl@@ ine . then said the Lord , Be@@ hold , I will set a plum@@ bl@@ ine in the midst of my people Israel : I will not again pass by them any more :
and he said , A@@ mos , what se@@ est thou ? and I said , A basket of summer fruit . then said the LORD unto me , The end is come upon my people of Israel ; I will not again pass by them any more .
and though they go into cap@@ tivity before their enemies , th@@ ence will I command the sword , and it shall sl@@ ay them : and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil , and not for good .
for the day of the LORD is near upon all the he@@ a@@ then : as thou hast done , it shall be done unto thee : thy reward shall return upon th@@ ine own head .
but let man and beast be covered with s@@ ack@@ cloth , and cry mi@@ gh@@ tily unto God : ye@@ a , let them turn every one from his evil way , and from the violence that is in their hands .
and God saw their works , that they turned from their evil way ; and God rep@@ ented of the evil , that he had said that he would do unto them ; and he did it not .
hear , all ye people ; hear@@ ken , O earth , and all that therein is : and let the Lord GO@@ D be witness against you , the Lord from his holy temple .
declare ye it not at G@@ ath , we@@ ep ye not at all : in the house of A@@ ph@@ rah roll thy@@ self in the dust .
make thee bal@@ d , and poll thee for thy delicate children ; enlarge thy bal@@ dness as the eagle ; for they are gone into cap@@ tivity from thee .
w@@ oe to them that devise ini@@ qu@@ ity , and work evil upon their beds ! when the morning is light , they practi@@ se it , because it is in the power of their hand .
O thou that art named the house of Jacob , is the spirit of the LORD stra@@ it@@ ened ? are these his do@@ ings ? do not my words do good to him that wal@@ ket@@ h upri@@ gh@@ tly ?
the women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses ; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever .
then shall the se@@ ers be ashamed , and the div@@ in@@ ers conf@@ ounded : ye@@ a , they shall all cover their lips ; for there is no answer of God .
and he shall judge among many people , and rebu@@ ke strong nations af@@ ar off ; and they shall beat their s@@ words into pl@@ ow@@ shares , and their spe@@ ars into pr@@ un@@ in@@ gh@@ oo@@ ks : nation shall not lift up a sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
and I will cut off wit@@ ch@@ crafts out of th@@ ine hand ; and thou shalt have no more soo@@ th@@ say@@ ers :
he hath sh@@ ew@@ ed thee , O man , what is good ; and what do@@ th the LORD require of thee , but to do justly , and to love mercy , and to walk hum@@ bly with thy God ?
the nations shall see and be conf@@ ounded at all their might : they shall lay their hand upon their mouth , their ears shall be deaf .
who is a God like unto thee , that par@@ don@@ eth ini@@ qu@@ ity , and pass@@ eth by the trans@@ g@@ ression of the remn@@ ant of his heritage ? he ret@@ ain@@ eth not his anger for ever , because he deli@@ ght@@ eth in mercy .
God is jeal@@ ous , and the LORD rev@@ eng@@ eth ; the LORD rev@@ eng@@ eth , and is furious ; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries , and he reserv@@ eth wrath for his enemies .
for while they be fol@@ den together as thor@@ ns , and while they are drun@@ ken as drun@@ k@@ ards , they shall be dev@@ oured as stub@@ ble fully dry .
but N@@ inev@@ eh is of old like a pool of water : yet they shall flee away . stand , stand , shall they cry ; but none shall look back .
the lion did tear in pieces enough for his whel@@ ps , and strang@@ led for his lion@@ esses , and filled his holes with prey , and his dens with rav@@ in .
because of the multitude of the wh@@ ore@@ doms of the well@@ fav@@ oured har@@ lot , the mistress of wit@@ ch@@ crafts , that sel@@ let@@ h nations through her wh@@ ore@@ doms , and families through her wit@@ ch@@ crafts .
behold , I am against thee , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts ; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face , and I will sh@@ ew the nations thy n@@ ak@@ edness , and the king@@ doms thy shame .
and it shall come to pass , that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee , and say , N@@ inev@@ eh is laid waste : who will b@@ emo@@ an her ? wh@@ ence shall I seek comfor@@ ters for thee ?
all thy strong holds shall be like fi@@ g trees with the fir@@ stri@@ pe fi@@ gs : if they be shaken , they shall even fall into the mouth of the e@@ ater .
behold , thy people in the midst of thee are women : the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto th@@ ine enemies : the fire shall dev@@ our thy bars .
they take up all of them with the angle , they catch them in their net , and gather them in their drag : therefore they rejoice and are glad .
therefore they sacrifice unto their net , and burn inc@@ ense unto their drag ; because by them their portion is fat , and their meat pl@@ ent@@ eous .
I will stand upon my watch , and set me upon the tower , and will watch to see what he will say unto me , and what I shall answer when I am re@@ proved .
shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee , and awake that shall ve@@ x thee , and thou shalt be for boo@@ ties unto them ?
w@@ oe to him that co@@ vet@@ eth an evil co@@ vet@@ ousness to his house , that he may set his nest on high , that he may be delivered from the power of evil !
w@@ oe unto him that gi@@ v@@ eth his neighbour drink , that put@@ test thy bottle to him , and mak@@ est him drun@@ ken also , that thou may@@ est look on their n@@ ak@@ edness !
God came from Tem@@ an , and the Holy One from mount Par@@ an . Sel@@ ah . his glory covered the heavens , and the earth was full of his praise .
and them that worship the host of heaven upon the hous@@ et@@ ops ; and them that worship and that swear by the LORD , and that swear by Mal@@ cha@@ m ;
and it shall come to pass at that time , that I will search Jerusalem with candles , and punish the men that are settled on their le@@ es : that say in their heart , The LORD will not do good , neither will he do evil .
the LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty ; he will save , he will rejoice over thee with joy ; he will rest in his love , he will joy over thee with singing .
and the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el the son of S@@ heal@@ ti@@ el , governor of Jud@@ ah , and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jos@@ ed@@ ech , the high priest , and the spirit of all the remn@@ ant of the people ; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts , their God ,
for , behold , I will shake mine hand upon them , and they shall be a spoil to their servants : and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me .
and he answered and sp@@ ake unto those that stood before him , saying , Take away the fil@@ thy garments from him . and unto him he said , Be@@ hold , I have caused th@@ ine ini@@ qu@@ ity to pass from thee , and I will clo@@ the thee with change of ra@@ iment .
even he shall build the temple of the LORD ; and he shall bear the glory , and shall sit and rule upon his throne ; and he shall be a priest upon his throne : and the counsel of peace shall be between them both .
and when ye did eat , and when ye did drink , did not ye eat for yourselves , and drink for yourselves ?
thus spe@@ ak@@ eth the LORD of hosts , saying , Exec@@ ute true judgment , and sh@@ ew mercy and comp@@ as@@ sions every man to his brother :
for the seed shall be prosperous ; the vine shall give her fruit , and the ground shall give her increase , and the heavens shall give their de@@ w ; and I will cause the remn@@ ant of this people to possess all these things .
and Ty@@ rus did build herself a strong hold , and he@@ aped up silver as the dust , and fine gold as the mire of the streets .
as for thee also , by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit where@@ in is no water .
mine anger was kind@@ led against the shep@@ herds , and I punished the goats : for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Jud@@ ah , and hath made them as his goo@@ dly horse in the battle .
and the LORD said unto me , Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd .
and the governors of Jud@@ ah shall say in their heart , The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of hosts their God .
ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar ; and ye say , W@@ herein have we polluted thee ? in that ye say , The table of the LORD is cont@@ emp@@ tible .
your words have been st@@ out against me , sa@@ ith the LORD . yet ye say , What have we spoken so much against thee ?
then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bid@@ den him , and took unto him his wife :
and being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Her@@ od , they departed into their own country another way .
in R@@ ama was there a voice heard , lam@@ entation , and we@@ eping , and great mourning , Rach@@ el we@@ eping for her children , and would not be comfor@@ ted , because they are not .
and were baptized of him in Jordan , conf@@ essing their sins .
and think not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
but John for@@ bad him , saying , I have need to be baptized of thee , and com@@ est thou to me ?
and going on from th@@ ence , he saw other two brethren , James the son of Ze@@ be@@ dee , and John his brother , in a ship with Ze@@ be@@ dee their father , men@@ ding their nets ; and he called them .
therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar , and there remem@@ ber@@ est that thy brother hath ought against thee ;
agree with th@@ ine adversary quickly , wh@@ iles thou art in the way with him ; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and thou be cast into prison .
and if thy right eye offend thee , pl@@ uck it out , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
and if thy right hand offend thee , cut if off , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
and if any man will sue thee at the law , and take away thy coat , let him have thy clo@@ ke also .
therefore when thou do@@ est th@@ ine al@@ ms , do not sound a trum@@ pet before thee , as the hypo@@ crit@@ es do in the syn@@ agogues and in the streets , that they may have glory of men . verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
but thou , when thou pra@@ y@@ est , enter into thy closet , and when thou hast shut thy door , pray to thy Father which is in secret ; and thy Father which se@@ eth in secret shall reward thee openly .
moreover when ye fast , be not , as the hypo@@ crit@@ es , of a sad coun@@ tenance : for they dis@@ figure their faces , that they may appear unto men to fast . verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
that thou appear not unto men to fast , but unto thy Father which is in secret : and thy Father , which se@@ eth in secret , shall reward thee openly .
but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor r@@ ust do@@ th corrupt , and where thieves do not break through nor steal :
and yet I say unto you , That even Solomon in all his glory was not ar@@ ra@@ yed like one of these .
take therefore no thought for the mor@@ row : for the mor@@ row shall take thought for the things of itself . sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof .
for with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged : and with what measure ye met@@ e , it shall be measured to you again .
many will say to me in that day , Lord , Lord , have we not prophe@@ si@@ ed in thy name ? and in thy name have cast out dev@@ ils ? and in thy name done many wonderful works ?
therefore wh@@ oso@@ ever he@@ areth these say@@ ings of mine , and do@@ eth them , I will lik@@ en him unto a wise man , which built his house upon a rock :
and every one that he@@ areth these say@@ ings of mine , and do@@ eth them not , shall be lik@@ ened unto a foolish man , which built his house upon the sand :
for I am a man under authority , having soldiers under me : and I say to this man , Go , and he go@@ eth ; and to another , Come , and he com@@ eth ; and to my servant , Do this , and he do@@ eth it .
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Es@@ ai@@ as the prophet , saying , Himself took our in@@ firm@@ ities , and bare our sick@@ nesses .
now when Jesus saw great multi@@ tudes about him , he gave commandment to depart unto the other side .
and , behold , certain of the scri@@ bes said within themselves , This man bl@@ asph@@ em@@ eth .
for she said within herself , If I may but touch his garment , I shall be whole .
and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples , he gave them power against un@@ clean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease .
he that fin@@ det@@ h his life shall lose it : and he that lo@@ set@@ h his life for my sake shall find it .
now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ , he sent two of his disciples ,
for this is he , of whom it is written , Be@@ hold , I send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
take my y@@ oke upon you , and learn of me ; for I am me@@ ek and low@@ ly in heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls .
and Jesus knew their thoughts , and said unto them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to des@@ ol@@ ation ; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand :
and if Satan cast out Satan , he is divided against himself ; how shall then his kingdom stand ?
then certain of the scri@@ bes and of the Pharis@@ ees answered , saying , Master , we would see a sign from thee .
then go@@ eth he , and tak@@ eth with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter in and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first . even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation .
so the servants of the house@@ holder came and said unto him , Sir , did@@ st not thou sow good seed in thy field ? from wh@@ ence then hath it tares ?
and they were offended in him . but Jesus said unto them , A prophet is not without honour , save in his own country , and in his own house .
why do thy disciples trans@@ gress the tradition of the elders ? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread .
and honour not his father or his mother , he shall be free . thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition .
and great multi@@ tudes came unto him , having with them those that were lame , blind , dumb , ma@@ im@@ ed , and many others , and cast them down at Jesus ' feet ; and he healed them :
and they reasoned among themselves , saying , It is because we have taken no bread .
then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ .
from that time forth began Jesus to sh@@ ew unto his disciples , how that he must go unto Jerusalem , and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scri@@ bes , and be killed , and be raised again the third day .
then said Jesus unto his disciples , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
and when the disciples heard it , they fell on their face , and were sore afraid .
and when they had lifted up their eyes , they saw no man , save Jesus only .
and if th@@ ine eye offend thee , pl@@ uck it out , and cast it from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire .
but if he will not hear thee , then take with thee one or two more , that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established .
but the same servant went out , and found one of his fel@@ low@@ servants , which owed him an hundred p@@ ence : and he laid hands on him , and took him by the throat , saying , Pay me that thou ow@@ est .
honour thy father and thy mother : and , Th@@ ou shalt love thy neighbour as thy@@ self .
and Jesus said unto them , Ver@@ ily I say unto you , That ye which have followed me , in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory , ye also shall sit upon twelve thr@@ ones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
and when he had agreed with the lab@@ our@@ ers for a penny a day , he sent them into his viney@@ ard .
take that th@@ ine is , and go thy way : I will give unto this last , even as unto thee .
the baptism of John , wh@@ ence was it ? from heaven , or of men ? and they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say unto us , Why did ye not then believe him ?
but what think ye ? a certain man had two sons ; and he came to the first , and said , Son , go work to day in my viney@@ ard .
saying , Master , Moses said , If a man die , having no children , his brother shall marry his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
and call no man your father upon the earth : for one is your Father , which is in heaven .
O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , thou that kill@@ est the prophets , and st@@ on@@ est them which are sent unto thee , how often would I have gathered thy children together , even as a hen gather@@ eth her chickens under her wings , and ye would not !
let him which is on the hous@@ et@@ op not come down to take any thing out of his house :
and shall begin to sm@@ ite his fel@@ low@@ servants , and to eat and drink with the drun@@ ken ;
they that were foolish took their lamps , and took no oil with them :
but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps .
for the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country , who called his own servants , and delivered unto them his goods .
when the Son of man shall come in his glory , and all the holy angels with him , then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory :
Peter said unto him , Th@@ ough I should die with thee , yet will I not deny thee . likewise also said all the disciples .
then said Pil@@ ate unto him , He@@ arest thou not how many things they witness against thee ?
and they that passed by re@@ vil@@ ed him , w@@ agging their heads ,
and Jesus came and sp@@ ake unto them , saying , All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth .
as it is written in the prophets , Be@@ hold , I send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
and there went out unto him all the land of Juda@@ ea , and they of Jerusalem , and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan , conf@@ essing their sins .
and strai@@ gh@@ tw@@ ay coming up out of the water , he saw the heavens opened , and the Spirit like a do@@ ve descending upon him :
but there were certain of the scri@@ bes sitting there , and reasoning in their hearts ,
and immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves , he said unto them , Why reason ye these things in your hearts ?
and when he had looked round about on them with anger , being griev@@ ed for the hard@@ ness of their hearts , he sa@@ ith unto the man , St@@ ret@@ ch forth th@@ ine hand . and he stretched it out : and his hand was restored whole as the other .
and he sp@@ ake to his disciples , that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude , lest they should thr@@ ong him .
and when his friends heard of it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said , He is beside himself .
and the scri@@ bes which came down from Jerusalem said , He hath Be@@ el@@ ze@@ bu@@ b , and by the prince of the dev@@ ils cast@@ eth he out dev@@ ils .
and if a kingdom be divided against itself , that kingdom C@@ AN@@ NOT stand .
and if a house be divided against itself , that house C@@ AN@@ NOT stand .
and if Satan rise up against himself , and be divided , he C@@ AN@@ NOT stand , but hath an end .
and he looked round about on them which sat about him , and said , Be@@ hold my mother and my brethren !
and have no root in themselves , and so endure but for a time : afterward , when afflic@@ tion or persecution ar@@ is@@ eth for the word 's sake , immediately they are offended .
and he said unto them , Take heed what ye hear : with what measure ye met@@ e , it shall be measured to you : and unto you that hear shall more be given .
and when they had sent away the multitude , they took him even as he was in the ship . and there were also with him other little ships .
and they feared exceedingly , and said one to another , What manner of man is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ?
and cried with a loud voice , and said , What have I to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of the most high God ? I ad@@ j@@ ure thee by God , that thou tor@@ ment me not .
How@@ be@@ it Jesus suffered him not , but sa@@ ith unto him , Go home to thy friends , and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee , and hath had compassion on thee .
and when a convenient day was come , that Her@@ od on his birthday made a sup@@ per to his lords , high cap@@ tains , and chief estates of Gal@@ ilee ;
and he went up unto them into the ship ; and the wind ceased : and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure , and wondered .
for Moses said , Hon@@ our thy father and thy mother ; and , Wh@@ os@@ o cur@@ set@@ h father or mother , let him die the death :
and ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother ;
and he commanded the people to sit down on the ground : and he took the seven lo@@ aves , and gave thanks , and brake , and gave to his disciples to set before them ; and they did set them before the people .
and they reasoned among themselves , saying , It is because we have no bread .
and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also , he said unto them , Wh@@ oso@@ ever will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
and suddenly , when they had looked round about , they saw no man any more , save Jesus only with themselves .
and wher@@ eso@@ ever he tak@@ eth him , he te@@ areth him : and he fo@@ amet@@ h , and gn@@ ash@@ eth with his teeth , and pin@@ eth away : and I sp@@ ake to thy disciples that they should cast him out ; and they could not .
and he came to Cap@@ ern@@ au@@ m : and being in the house he asked them , What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way ?
salt is good : but if the salt have lost his sal@@ tness , where@@ with will ye season it ? have salt in yourselves , and have peace one with another .
and if a woman shall put away her husband , and be married to another , she commit@@ t@@ eth adul@@ tery .
and they were astonished out of measure , saying among themselves , Who then can be saved ?
then Peter began to say unto him , L@@ o , we have left all , and have followed thee .
and he , casting away his garment , rose , and came to Jesus .
and they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why then did ye not believe him ?
and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind , and with all thy strength : this is the first commandment .
and the second is like , namely this , Th@@ ou shalt love thy neighbour as thy@@ self . there is none other commandment greater than these .
and to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbour as himself , is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices .
for David himself said by the Holy Ghost , The Lord said to my Lord , S@@ it thou on my right hand , till I make th@@ ine enemies thy foot@@ stool .
but take heed to yourselves : for they shall deliver you up to councils ; and in the syn@@ agogues ye shall be beaten : and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them .
and let him that is on the hous@@ et@@ op not go down into the house , neither enter therein , to take any thing out of his house :
for ye have the poor with you always , and wh@@ en@@ soever ye will ye may do them good : but me ye have not always .
but he sp@@ ake the more ve@@ hem@@ ently , If I should die with thee , I will not deny thee in any wise . likewise also said they all .
and they came to a place which was named Ge@@ th@@ sem@@ ane : and he sa@@ ith to his disciples , S@@ it ye here , while I shall pray .
then the high priest rent his clothes , and sa@@ ith , What need we any further witnesses ?
and Pil@@ ate asked him again , saying , Answ@@ er@@ est thou nothing ? behold how many things they witness against thee .
likewise also the chief priests mo@@ cking said among themselves with the scri@@ bes , He saved others ; himself he C@@ AN@@ NOT save .
and at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , E@@ lo@@ i , E@@ lo@@ i , l@@ ama sab@@ ach@@ than@@ i ? which is , being interpreted , My God , my God , why hast thou for@@ s@@ aken me ?
and these signs shall follow them that believe ; In my name shall they cast out dev@@ ils ; they shall speak with new tongues ;
Lord , now let@@ test thou thy servant depart in peace , according to thy word :
and there was one Anna , a proph@@ et@@ ess , the daughter of P@@ han@@ u@@ el , of the tribe of As@@ er : she was of a great age , and had lived with an husband seven years from her vir@@ g@@ inity ;
bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and begin not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
and they were all amazed , and sp@@ ake among themselves , saying , What a word is this ! for with authority and power he comman@@ det@@ h the un@@ clean spirits , and they come out .
now when he had left speaking , he said unto Simon , Launch out into the deep , and let down your nets for a drau@@ ght .
and Simon answering said unto him , Master , we have to@@ iled all the night , and have taken nothing : nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net .
but so much the more went there a fame abroad of him : and great multi@@ tudes came together to hear , and to be healed by him of their in@@ firm@@ ities .
and immediately he rose up before them , and took up that where@@ on he lay , and departed to his own house , glori@@ fying God .
and Lev@@ i made him a great feast in his own house : and there was a great company of public@@ ans and of others that sat down with them .
and they were filled with madness ; and commun@@ ed one with another what they might do to Jesus .
and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples , and said , Bless@@ ed be ye poor : for yours is the kingdom of God .
give to every man that as@@ ket@@ h of thee ; and of him that tak@@ eth away thy goods ask them not again .
give , and it shall be given unto you ; good measure , pressed down , and shaken together , and running over , shall men give into your bos@@ om . for with the same measure that ye met@@ e with@@ al it shall be measured to you again .
for every tree is known by his own fruit . for of thor@@ ns men do not gather fi@@ gs , nor of a br@@ am@@ ble bush gather they grapes .
now when he had ended all his say@@ ings in the audience of the people , he entered into Cap@@ ern@@ au@@ m .
for I also am a man set under authority , having under me soldiers , and I say unto one , Go , and he go@@ eth ; and to another , Come , and he com@@ eth ; and to my servant , Do this , and he do@@ eth it .
and there came a fear on all : and they glori@@ fied God , saying , That a great prophet is risen up among us ; and , That God hath visited his people .
this is he , of whom it is written , Be@@ hold , I send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
but the Pharis@@ ees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves , being not baptized of him .
now when the Pharis@@ ee which had bid@@ den him saw it , he sp@@ ake within himself , saying , This man , if he were a prophet , would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touch@@ eth him : for she is a sinner .
and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves , Who is this that for@@ gi@@ v@@ eth sins also ?
when he saw Jesus , he cried out , and fell down before him , and with a loud voice said , What have I to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of God most high ? I bes@@ e@@ ech thee , tor@@ ment me not .
and he said to them all , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me .
for wh@@ oso@@ ever will save his life shall lose it : but wh@@ oso@@ ever will lose his life for my sake , the same shall save it .
let these say@@ ings sink down into your ears : for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men .
and John answered and said , Master , we saw one casting out dev@@ ils in thy name ; and we for@@ bad him , because he follow@@ eth not with us .
and Jesus said unto him , No man , having put his hand to the pl@@ ough , and looking back , is fit for the kingdom of God .
and in the same house remain , eating and drinking such things as they give : for the lab@@ ou@@ rer is worthy of his hire . go not from house to house .
now it came to pass , as they went , that he entered into a certain village : and a certain woman named Mar@@ tha received him into her house .
and it came to pass , that , as he was praying in a certain place , when he ceased , one of his disciples said unto him , Lord , teach us to pray , as John also taught his disciples .
and he said unto them , When ye pray , say , Our Father which art in heaven , hal@@ lowed be thy name . thy kingdom come . thy will be done , as in heaven , so in earth .
but he , knowing their thoughts , said unto them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to des@@ ol@@ ation ; and a house divided against a house fall@@ eth .
if Satan also be divided against himself , how shall his kingdom stand ? because ye say that I cast out dev@@ ils through Be@@ el@@ ze@@ bu@@ b .
then go@@ eth he , and tak@@ eth to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself ; and they enter in , and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first .
and he said , W@@ oe unto you also , ye lawyers ! for ye L@@ ade men with burdens griev@@ ous to be borne , and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers .
and he thought within himself , saying , What shall I do , because I have no room where to best@@ ow my fruits ?
and he said , This will I do : I will pull down my bar@@ ns , and build greater ; and there will I best@@ ow all my fruits and my goods .
so is he that lay@@ eth up treasure for himself , and is not rich toward God .
and he said unto his disciples , T@@ herefore I say unto you , Take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat ; neither for the body , what ye shall put on .
consider the l@@ ilies how they grow : they to@@ il not , they spin not ; and yet I say unto you , that Solomon in all his glory was not ar@@ ra@@ yed like one of these .
and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord , when he will return from the wedding ; that when he com@@ eth and kno@@ c@@ ket@@ h , they may open unto him immediately .
ye@@ a , and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right ?
he sp@@ ake also this parable ; A certain man had a fi@@ g tree planted in his viney@@ ard ; and he came and sought fruit there@@ on , and found none .
the Lord then answered him , and said , Th@@ ou hypo@@ cr@@ ite , do@@ th not each one of you on the sab@@ bath loose his ox or his ass from the stall , and lead him away to wat@@ ering ?
it is like a grain of mu@@ st@@ ard seed , which a man took , and cast into his garden ; and it grew , and wa@@ xed a great tree ; and the f@@ ow@@ ls of the air lodged in the branches of it .
there shall be we@@ eping and gn@@ ashing of teeth , when ye shall see Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , and all the prophets , in the kingdom of God , and you yourselves thrust out .
O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , which kill@@ est the prophets , and st@@ on@@ est them that are sent unto thee ; how often would I have gathered thy children together , as a hen do@@ th gather her bro@@ od under her wings , and ye would not !
for wh@@ oso@@ ever exal@@ t@@ eth himself shall be ab@@ ased ; and he that hum@@ bl@@ eth himself shall be exalted .
and sent his servant at sup@@ per time to say to them that were bid@@ den , Come ; for all things are now ready .
if any man come to me , and hate not his father , and mother , and wife , and children , and brethren , and sisters , ye@@ a , and his own life also , he C@@ AN@@ NOT be my disciple .
and when he came to himself , he said , How many hired servants of my father 's have bread enough and to spare , and I perish with hunger !
and am no more worthy to be called thy son : make me as one of thy hired servants .
and the son said unto him , Father , I have sin@@ ned against heaven , and in thy sight , and am no more worthy to be called thy son .
but as soon as this thy son was come , which hath dev@@ oured thy living with har@@ lots , thou hast killed for him the fat@@ ted cal@@ f .
and he said also unto his disciples , There was a certain rich man , which had a ste@@ ward ; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods .
then the ste@@ ward said within himself , What shall I do ? for my lord tak@@ eth away from me the stewardship : I C@@ AN@@ NOT dig ; to beg I am ashamed .
I am resolved what to do , that , when I am put out of the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses .
so he called every one of his lord 's debtors unto him , and said unto the first , How much ow@@ est thou unto my lord ?
and he cried and said , Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Laz@@ ar@@ us , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue ; for I am tor@@ m@@ ented in this flame .
take heed to yourselves : if thy brother t@@ resp@@ ass against thee , rebu@@ ke him ; and if he repent , forgive him .
and he would not for a while : but afterward he said within himself , Th@@ ough I fear not God , nor regard man ;
and shall not God av@@ enge his own elect , which cry day and night unto him , though he bear long with them ?
and he sp@@ ake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and desp@@ ised others :
the Pharis@@ ee stood and prayed thus with himself , God , I thank thee , that I am not as other men are , extor@@ tion@@ ers , unjust , adul@@ ter@@ ers , or even as this public@@ an .
I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other : for every one that exal@@ t@@ eth himself shall be ab@@ ased ; and he that hum@@ bl@@ eth himself shall be exalted .
and he called his ten servants , and delivered them ten pounds , and said unto them , Occu@@ py till I come .
but those mine enemies , which would not that I should reign over them , bring hi@@ ther , and sl@@ ay them before me .
and some of the Pharis@@ ees from among the multitude said unto him , Master , rebu@@ ke thy disciples .
saying , If thou had@@ st known , even thou , at least in this thy day , the things which belong unto thy peace ! but now they are hid from th@@ ine eyes .
and shall lay thee even with the ground , and thy children within thee ; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another ; because thou k@@ newest not the time of thy vis@@ itation .
but when the Hus@@ band@@ men saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , This is the heir : come , let us kill him , that the inheritance may be ours .
then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples ,
and he looked up , and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury .
and take heed to yourselves , lest at any time your hearts be over@@ charged with sur@@ fe@@ iting , and drun@@ ken@@ ness , and cares of this life , and so that day come upon you un@@ awa@@ res .
and he took the cup , and gave thanks , and said , Take this , and divide it among yourselves :
but I have prayed for thee , that thy faith fail not : and when thou art converted , strengthen thy brethren .
then said he unto them , But now , he that hath a pur@@ se , let him take it , and likewise his scri@@ p : and he that hath no sword , let him sell his garment , and buy one .
and the same day Pil@@ ate and Her@@ od were made friends together : for before they were at enmity between themselves .
but Jesus turning unto them said , Dau@@ ghters of Jerusalem , we@@ ep not for me , but we@@ ep for yourselves , and for your children .
and as they were afraid , and bowed down their faces to the earth , they said unto them , Why seek ye the living among the dead ?
and they talked together of all these things which had happened .
and it came to pass , that , while they commun@@ ed together and reasoned , Jesus himself drew near , and went with them .
and he said unto them , What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another , as ye walk , and are sad ?
then said they unto him , Who art thou ? that we may give an answer to them that sent us . what say@@ est thou of thy@@ self ?
the next day John se@@ eth Jesus coming unto him , and sa@@ ith , Be@@ hold the Lam@@ b of God , which tak@@ eth away the sin of the world .
and John bare record , saying , I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a do@@ ve , and it ab@@ ode upon him .
for God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world ; but that the world through him might be saved .
John answered and said , A man can receive nothing , except it be given him from heaven .
the woman then left her water@@ pot , and went her way into the city , and sa@@ ith to the men ,
therefore said the disciples one to another , H@@ ath any man brought him ought to eat ?
for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool , and troubled the water : wh@@ oso@@ ever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had .
and immediately the man was made whole , and took up his bed , and walked : and on the same day was the sab@@ bath .
then answered Jesus and said unto them , Ver@@ ily , verily , I say unto you , The Son can do nothing of himself , but what he se@@ eth the Father do : for what things soever he do@@ eth , these also do@@ eth the Son likewise .
I can of mine own self do nothing : as I hear , I judge : and my judgment is just ; because I seek not mine own will , but the will of the Father which hath sent me .
but I know you , that ye have not the love of God in you .
Jesus therefore answered and said unto them , Mur@@ mur not among yourselves .
the Jews therefore stro@@ ve among themselves , saying , How can this man give us his flesh to eat ?
then Jesus said unto them , Ver@@ ily , verily , I say unto you , Exc@@ ept ye eat the flesh of the Son of man , and drink his blood , ye have no life in you .
when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples mur@@ mu@@ red at it , he said unto them , do@@ th this offend you ?
if any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of God , or whether I speak of myself .
then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught , saying , Y@@ e both know me , and ye know wh@@ ence I am : and I am not come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye know not .
then said Jesus unto them , When ye have lifted up the Son of man , then shall ye know that I am he , and that I do nothing of myself ; but as my Father hath taught me , I speak these things .
art thou greater than our father Abraham , which is dead ? and the prophets are dead : whom mak@@ est thou thy@@ self ?
Jesus said unto them , If ye were blind , ye should have no sin : but now ye say , We see ; therefore your sin remain@@ eth .
I am the good shepherd : the good shepherd gi@@ v@@ eth his life for the sheep .
but he that is an hi@@ rel@@ ing , and not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , se@@ eth the wolf coming , and leav@@ eth the sheep , and fle@@ eth : and the wolf cat@@ ch@@ eth them , and sc@@ atter@@ eth the sheep .
and I give unto them eternal life ; and they shall never perish , neither shall any man pl@@ uck them out of my hand .
Jesus therefore again gro@@ aning in himself com@@ eth to the grave . it was a cave , and a stone lay upon it .
this he said , not that he cared for the poor ; but because he was a thief , and had the bag , and bare what was put therein .
for the poor always ye have with you ; but me ye have not always .
the Pharis@@ ees therefore said among themselves , perceive ye how ye prevail nothing ? behold , the world is gone after him .
he that lov@@ eth his life shall lose it ; and he that hat@@ eth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal .
he that rej@@ ec@@ t@@ eth me , and recei@@ v@@ eth not my words , hath one that jud@@ get@@ h him : the word that I have spoken , the same shall judge him in the last day .
for I have not spoken of myself ; but the Father which sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
he ris@@ eth from sup@@ per , and laid aside his garments ; and took a towel , and gir@@ ded himself .
by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples , if ye have love one to another .
and if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and receive you unto myself ; that where I am , there ye may be also .
Beli@@ ev@@ est thou not that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself : but the Father that dwell@@ eth in me , he do@@ eth the works .
if ye keep my commandments , ye shall abide in my love ; even as I have kept my Father 's commandments , and abide in his love .
greater love hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends .
if ye were of the world , the world would love his own : but because ye are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world hat@@ eth you .
and now , O Father , glori@@ fy thou me with th@@ ine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was .
and now come I to thee ; and these things I speak in the world , that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves .
O righteous Father , the world hath not known thee : but I have known thee , and these have known that thou hast sent me .
Jesus answered him , say@@ est thou this thing of thy@@ self , or did others tell it thee of me ?
when Jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he loved , he sa@@ ith unto his mother , Woman , behold thy son !
then sa@@ ith he to the disciple , Be@@ hold thy mother ! and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home .
Jesus sa@@ ith unto her , Touch me not ; for I am not yet asc@@ ended to my Father : but go to my brethren , and say unto them , I asc@@ end unto my Father , and your Father ; and to my God , and your God .
and they were all amazed and marv@@ elled , saying one to another , Be@@ hold , are not all these which speak Gal@@ il@@ a@@ e@@ ans ?
but Peter , standing up with the eleven , lifted up his voice , and said unto them , Y@@ e men of Juda@@ ea , and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem , be this known unto you , and hear@@ ken to my words :
and I will sh@@ ew wonders in heaven above , and signs in the earth beneath ; blood , and fire , and vap@@ our of smoke :
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves ,
and now , Lord , behold their threat@@ en@@ ings : and grant unto thy servants , that with all bold@@ ness they may speak thy word ,
wh@@ iles it remained , was it not th@@ ine own ? and after it was sold , was it not in th@@ ine own power ? why hast thou conceived this thing in th@@ ine heart ? thou hast not lied unto men , but unto God .
and laid their hands on the apostles , and put them in the common prison .
and said unto them , Y@@ e men of Israel , take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men .
after this man rose up Jud@@ as of Gal@@ ilee in the days of the taxing , and drew away much people after him : he also perished ; and all , even as many as obeyed him , were dispersed .
and said unto him , Get thee out of thy country , and from thy kind@@ red , and come into the land which I shall sh@@ ew thee .
and delivered him out of all his afflic@@ tions , and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt ; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house .
and at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren ; and Joseph 's kind@@ red was made known unto Phar@@ aoh .
the same dealt sub@@ til@@ ly with our kind@@ red , and evil entre@@ ated our fathers , so that they cast out their young children , to the end they might not live .
and when he was cast out , Phar@@ aoh 's daughter took him up , and nourished him for her own son .
and when he was full forty years old , it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel .
then they cried out with a loud voice , and stopped their ears , and ran upon him with one accord ,
repent therefore of this thy w@@ ick@@ edness , and pray God , if perhaps the thought of th@@ ine heart may be forgiven thee .
was returning , and sitting in his ch@@ ari@@ ot read Es@@ ai@@ as the prophet .
the place of the scrip@@ ture which he read was this , He was led as a sheep to the slaughter ; and like a lamb dumb before his she@@ arer , so opened he not his mouth :
and the e@@ un@@ uch answered Philip , and said , I pray thee , of whom spe@@ ak@@ eth the prophet this ? of himself , or of some other man ?
then An@@ ani@@ as answered , Lord , I have heard by many of this man , how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem :
and when he looked on him , he was afraid , and said , What is it , Lord ? and he said unto him , Th@@ y prayers and th@@ ine al@@ ms are come up for a memorial before God .
now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean , behold , the men which were sent from Corn@@ eli@@ us had made inquiry for Simon 's house , and stood before the gate ,
and the mor@@ row after they entered into Caes@@ area . and Corn@@ eli@@ us waited for them , and had called together his kin@@ smen and near friends .
how God ano@@ inted Jesus of Naz@@ areth with the Holy Ghost and with power : who went about doing good , and healing all that were oppressed of the devil ; for God was with him .
and they said unto her , Th@@ ou art mad . but she constantly affirmed that it was even so . then said they , It is his angel .
and Bar@@ nab@@ as and Saul returned from Jerusalem , when they had fulfilled their ministry , and took with them John , whose surname was Mark .
and when they were at Sal@@ am@@ is , they preached the word of God in the syn@@ agogues of the Jews : and they had also John to their minister .
nevertheless he left not himself without witness , in that he did good , and gave us rain from heaven , and fruitful seasons , filling our hearts with food and gl@@ ad@@ ness .
that ye abst@@ ain from me@@ ats offered to idols , and from blood , and from things strang@@ led , and from for@@ n@@ ication : from which if ye keep yourselves , ye shall do well . fare ye well .
but Paul cried with a loud voice , saying , Do thy@@ self no harm : for we are all here .
and when he had brought them into his house , he set meat before them , and rejo@@ iced , believing in God with all his house .
and when they opposed themselves , and bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed , he shook his ra@@ iment , and said unto them , Your blood be upon your own heads ; I am clean : from h@@ ence@@ forth I will go unto the Genti@@ les .
and Cris@@ pus , the chief ruler of the synagogue , believed on the Lord with all his house ; and many of the Corinth@@ ians hearing believed , and were baptized .
and now , behold , I know that ye all , among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God , shall see my face no more .
take heed therefore unto yourselves , and to all the flock , over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you over@@ se@@ ers , to feed the church of God , which he hath purchased with his own blood .
also of your own selves shall men arise , speaking perverse things , to draw away disciples after them .
and when he had thus spoken , he kne@@ eled down , and prayed with them all .
there went with us also certain of the disciples of Caes@@ area , and brought with them one M@@ nas@@ on of Cyprus , an old disciple , with whom we should lodge .
do therefore this that we say to thee : we have four men which have a vo@@ w on them ;
and I said , Lord , they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee :
then said Paul , I w@@ ist not , brethren , that he was the high priest : for it is written , Th@@ ou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people .
then A@@ gri@@ pp@@ a said unto Paul , Th@@ ou art permitted to speak for thy@@ self . then Paul stretched forth the hand , and answered for himself :
my manner of life from my youth , which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem , know all the Jews ;
and when they were gone aside , they talked between themselves , saying , This man do@@ eth nothing worthy of death or of bonds .
and when they agreed not among themselves , they departed , after that Paul had spoken one word , Well sp@@ ake the Holy Ghost by Es@@ ai@@ as the prophet unto our fathers ,
making request , if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you .
and likewise also the men , leaving the natural use of the woman , burned in their lust one toward another ; men with men working that which is un@@ seem@@ ly , and receiving in themselves that re@@ comp@@ ence of their error which was meet .
or desp@@ is@@ est thou the riches of his goodness and for@@ bear@@ ance and long@@ suffering ; not knowing that the goodness of God lead@@ eth thee to repentance ?
but after thy hard@@ ness and im@@ penit@@ ent heart treas@@ u@@ rest up unto thy@@ self wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God ;
and art confident that thou thy@@ self art a guide of the blind , a light of them which are in darkness ,
but I see another law in my members , war@@ ring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into cap@@ tivity to the law of sin which is in my members .
for what the law could not do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God sending his own Son in the lik@@ eness of sinful flesh , and for sin , condemned sin in the flesh :
and not only they , but ourselves also , which have the fir@@ st@@ fruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves gro@@ an within ourselves , waiting for the adoption , to w@@ it , the redemption of our body .
but what sa@@ ith it ? the word is ni@@ gh thee , even in thy mouth , and in thy heart : that is , the word of faith , which we preach ;
for I would not , brethren , that ye should be ignorant of this mystery , lest ye should be wise in your own conce@@ its ; that blindness in part is happened to Israel , until the fulness of the Genti@@ les be come in .
dearly beloved , av@@ enge not yourselves , but rather give place unto wrath : for it is written , Ven@@ ge@@ ance is mine ; I will repay , sa@@ ith the Lord .
wh@@ oso@@ ever therefore resist@@ eth the power , resist@@ eth the ordin@@ ance of God : and they that resist shall receive to themselves dam@@ nation .
so then every one of us shall give account of himself to God .
hast thou faith ? have it to thy@@ self before God . happy is he that condem@@ neth not himself in that thing which he allow@@ eth .
for even Christ pleased not himself ; but , as it is written , The repro@@ aches of them that repro@@ ached thee fell on me .
now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that ye may abound in hope , through the power of the Holy Ghost .
let no man deceive himself . if any man among you seem@@ eth to be wise in this world , let him become a fool , that he may be wise .
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you , or of man 's judgment : ye@@ a , I judge not mine own self .
for I know nothing by myself ; yet am I not hereby justified : but he that jud@@ get@@ h me is the Lord .
I write not these things to shame you , but as my beloved sons I warn you .
now therefore there is utterly a fault among you , because ye go to law one with another . why do ye not rather take wrong ? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be def@@ ra@@ u@@ ded ?
what ? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you , which ye have of God , and ye are not your own ?
but and if she depart , let her remain un@@ married , or be reconciled to her husband : and let not the husband put away his wife .
for he that e@@ at@@ eth and drin@@ ket@@ h un@@ worth@@ ily , e@@ at@@ eth and drin@@ ket@@ h dam@@ nation to himself , not discer@@ ning the Lord 's body .
for if we would judge ourselves , we should not be judged .
and if they will learn any thing , let them ask their husbands at home : for it is a shame for women to speak in the church .
upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store , as God hath prosper@@ ed him , that there be no gatherings when I come .
but we had the sentence of death in ourselves , that we should not trust in ourselves , but in God which ra@@ is@@ eth the dead :
but I determined this with myself , that I would not come again to you in heav@@ iness .
not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves ; but our sufficiency is of God ;
and not as Moses , which put a V@@ ail over his face , that the children of Israel could not st@@ ed@@ fast@@ ly look to the end of that which is abolished :
for whether we be beside ourselves , it is to God : or whether we be sober , it is for your cause .
for we dare not make ourselves of the number , or compare ourselves with some that comm@@ end themselves : but they measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves among themselves , are not wise .
of such an one will I glory : yet of myself I will not glory , but in mine in@@ firm@@ ities .
examine yourselves , whether ye be in the faith ; prove your own selves . know ye not your own selves , how that Jesus Christ is in you , except ye be re@@ prob@@ ates ?
I mar@@ vel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel :
for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews ' religion , how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God , and wasted it :
but when it pleased God , who separated me from my mother 's womb , and called me by his grace ,
then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Bar@@ nab@@ as , and took Tit@@ us with me also .
and my temptation which was in my flesh ye desp@@ ised not , nor rejected ; but received me as an angel of God , even as Christ Jesus .
I have confidence in you through the Lord , that ye will be none otherwise minded : but he that troubl@@ eth you shall bear his judgment , wh@@ oso@@ ever he be .
for all the law is fulfilled in one word , even in this ; Th@@ ou shalt love thy neighbour as thy@@ self .
brethren , if a man be over@@ taken in a fault , ye which are spiritual , restore such an one in the spirit of me@@ ek@@ ness ; considering thy@@ self , lest thou also be tempted .
for if a man think himself to be something , when he is nothing , he decei@@ v@@ eth himself .
but let every man prove his own work , and then shall he have rejo@@ icing in himself alone , and not in another .
as we have therefore opportunity , let us do good unto all men , especially unto them who are of the household of faith .
in whom also we have obtained an inheritance , being pre@@ dest@@ inated according to the purpose of him who work@@ eth all things after the counsel of his own will :
cease not to give thanks for you , making mention of you in my prayers ;
but God , who is rich in mercy , for his great love where@@ with he loved us ,
that in the ages to come he might sh@@ ew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus .
this I say therefore , and testify in the Lord , that ye h@@ ence@@ forth walk not as other Genti@@ les walk , in the van@@ ity of their mind ,
W@@ herefore putting away lying , speak every man truth with his neighbour : for we are members one of another .
let all bitterness , and wrath , and anger , and clam@@ our , and evil speaking , be put away from you , with all mal@@ ice :
speaking to yourselves in p@@ sal@@ ms and hym@@ ns and spiritual songs , singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord ;
for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall be joined unto his wife , and they two shall be one flesh .
servants , be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in sing@@ l@@ eness of your heart , as unto Christ ;
let nothing be done through strife or v@@ ain@@ glory ; but in low@@ liness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves .
look not every man on his own things , but every man also on the things of others .
for all seek their own , not the things which are Jesus Christ 's .
and I int@@ re@@ at thee also , true yo@@ ke@@ fellow , help those women which lab@@ oured with me in the gospel , with Cl@@ ement also , and with other my fel@@ low@@ lab@@ our@@ ers , whose names are in the book of life .
forbid@@ ding us to speak to the Genti@@ les that they might be saved , to fill up their sins al@@ way : for the wrath is come upon them to the utter@@ most .
he therefore that desp@@ is@@ eth , desp@@ is@@ eth not man , but God , who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit .
and that ye study to be quiet , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , as we commanded you ;
for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the ar@@ chang@@ el , and with the trump of God : and the dead in Christ shall rise first :
one that rul@@ eth well his own house , having his children in subj@@ ection with all gravity ;
let the de@@ ac@@ ons be the husbands of one wife , ruling their children and their own houses well .
take heed unto thy@@ self , and unto the doctrine ; continue in them : for in doing this thou shalt both save thy@@ self , and them that hear thee .
let as many servants as are under the y@@ oke count their own masters worthy of all honour , that the name of God and his doctrine be not bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed .
charge them that are rich in this world , that they be not high@@ minded , nor trust in uncertain riches , but in the living God , who gi@@ v@@ eth us rich@@ ly all things to enjoy ;
when I call to rem@@ embrance the un@@ fe@@ igned faith that is in thee , which d@@ wel@@ t first in thy grandmother Lo@@ is , and thy mother E@@ un@@ ice ; and I am persuaded that in thee also .
remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel :
and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work , and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom : to whom be glory for ever and ever . A@@ men .
in all things sh@@ ew@@ ing thy@@ self a pattern of good works : in doctrine sh@@ ew@@ ing un@@ corrup@@ tness , gravity , sincerity ,
I thank my God , making mention of thee always in my prayers ,
that the communication of thy faith may become effec@@ tual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus .
I bes@@ e@@ ech thee for my son One@@ sim@@ us , whom I have be@@ gotten in my bonds :
whom I would have retained with me , that in thy stead he might have minist@@ ered unto me in the bonds of the gospel :
and of the angels he sa@@ ith , Who mak@@ eth his angels spirits , and his ministers a flame of fire .
but unto the Son he sa@@ ith , Th@@ y throne , O God , is for ever and ever : a scep@@ tre of righteousness is the scep@@ tre of thy kingdom .
thou hast loved righteousness , and hated ini@@ qu@@ ity ; therefore God , even thy God , hath ano@@ inted thee with the oil of gl@@ ad@@ ness above thy fellows .
and , Th@@ ou , Lord , in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth ; and the heavens are the works of th@@ ine hands :
and as a vest@@ ure shalt thou fold them up , and they shall be changed : but thou art the same , and thy years shall not fail .
for he sp@@ ake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise , And God did rest the seventh day from all his works .
for he that is entered into his rest , he also hath ceased from his own works , as God did from his .
and no man tak@@ eth this honour unto himself , but he that is called of God , as was Aaron .
and here men that die receive ti@@ thes ; but there he recei@@ v@@ eth them , of whom it is witnessed that he liv@@ eth .
and they shall not teach every man his neighbour , and every man his brother , saying , Know the Lord : for all shall know me , from the least to the greatest .
but into the second went the high priest alone once every year , not without blood , which he offered for himself , and for the errors of the people :
then said I , L@@ o , I come ( in the volume of the book it is written of me , ) to do thy will , O God .
then said he , L@@ o , I come to do thy will , O God . he tak@@ eth away the first , that he may establish the second .
but we are not of them who draw back unto per@@ dition ; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul .
by faith E@@ no@@ ch was translated that he should not see death ; and was not found , because God had translated him : for before his translation he had this testimony , that he pleased God .
by faith Noah , being warned of God of things not seen as yet , moved with fear , prepared an ark to the saving of his house ; by the which he condemned the world , and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith .
therefore sprang there even of one , and him as good as dead , so many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable .
these all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them af@@ ar off , and were persuaded of them , and embraced them , and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
E@@ ste@@ em@@ ing the repro@@ ach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt : for he had respect unto the re@@ comp@@ ence of the reward .
a double minded man is unstable in all his ways .
but be ye do@@ ers of the word , and not hear@@ ers only , decei@@ ving your own selves .
for if any be a he@@ arer of the word , and not a do@@ er , he is like unto a man be@@ holding his natural face in a glass :
and ye have respect to him that we@@ areth the gay clothing , and say unto him , S@@ it thou here in a good place ; and say to the poor , Stand thou there , or sit here under my foot@@ stool :
are ye not then partial in yourselves , and are become judges of evil thoughts ?
if ye fulfil the royal law according to the scrip@@ ture , Th@@ ou shalt love thy neighbour as thy@@ self , ye do well :
ye@@ a , a man may say , Th@@ ou hast faith , and I have works : sh@@ ew me thy faith without thy works , and I will sh@@ ew thee my faith by my works .
ye see then how that by works a man is justified , and not by faith only .
and he prayed again , and the heaven gave rain , and the earth brought forth her fruit .
ye also , as lively stones , are built up a spiritual house , an holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to God by Jesus Christ .
likewise , ye wives , be in subj@@ ection to your own husbands ; that , if any obey not the word , they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives ;
for he that will love life , and see good days , let him refrain his tongue from evil , and his lips that they speak no gu@@ ile :
for@@ as@@ much then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh , arm yourselves likewise with the same mind : for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin ;
but there were false prophets also among the people , even as there shall be false teachers among you , who priv@@ ily shall bring in dam@@ n@@ able here@@ sies , even denying the Lord that bought them , and bring upon themselves swift destruction .
if we say that we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
hereby perceive we the love of God , because he laid down his life for us : and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren .
but wh@@ os@@ o hath this world 's good , and se@@ eth his brother have need , and shut@@ t@@ eth up his bow@@ els of compassion from him , how dwell@@ eth the love of God in him ?
herein is love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us , and sent his Son to be the prop@@ iti@@ ation for our sins .
and this commandment have we from him , That he who lov@@ eth God love his brother also .
for there are three that bear record in heaven , the Father , the Word , and the Holy Ghost : and these three are one .
he that believ@@ eth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself : he that believ@@ eth not God hath made him a li@@ ar ; because he believ@@ eth not the record that God gave of his Son .
I rejo@@ iced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth , as we have received a commandment from the Father .
look to yourselves , that we lose not those things which we have wrought , but that we receive a full reward .
how that they told you there should be mo@@ c@@ kers in the last time , who should walk after their own un@@ go@@ dly lu@@ sts .
the Revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave unto him , to sh@@ ew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass ; and he sent and signi@@ fied it by his angel unto his servant John :
I was in the Spirit on the Lord 's day , and heard behind me a great voice , as of a trum@@ pet ,
and he had in his right hand seven stars : and out of his mouth went a sharp tw@@ o@@ ed@@ ged sword : and his coun@@ tenance was as the sun sh@@ in@@ eth in his strength .
nevertheless I have somewhat against thee , because thou hast left thy first love .
I know thy works , and tribu@@ lation , and poverty , ( but thou art rich ) and I know the bl@@ asph@@ emy of them which say they are Jews , and are not , but are the synagogue of Satan .
I know thy works , and charity , and service , and faith , and thy patience , and thy works ; and the last to be more than the first .
thou hast a few names even in Sar@@ dis which have not de@@ filed their garments ; and they shall walk with me in white : for they are worthy .
I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire , that thou may@@ est be rich ; and white ra@@ iment , that thou may@@ est be clo@@ thed , and that the shame of thy n@@ ak@@ edness do not appear ; and ano@@ int th@@ ine eyes with ey@@ es@@ al@@ ve , that thou may@@ est see .
and immediately I was in the spirit : and , behold , a throne was set in heaven , and one sat on the throne .
and round about the throne were four and twenty seats : and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting , clo@@ thed in white ra@@ iment ; and they had on their heads crow@@ ns of gold .
the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne , and worship him that liv@@ eth for ever and ever , and cast their crow@@ ns before the throne , saying ,
and when he had opened the third seal , I heard the third beast say , Come and see . and I be@@ held , and lo a black horse ; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand .
and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together ; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places .
and I said unto him , Sir , thou know@@ est . and he said to me , These are they which came out of great tribu@@ lation , and have washed their robes , and made them white in the blood of the Lam@@ b .
neither rep@@ ented they of their murders , nor of their sorcer@@ ies , nor of their for@@ n@@ ication , nor of their the@@ fts .
and he had in his hand a little book open : and he set his right foot upon the sea , and his left foot on the earth ,
and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven ,
and the seventh angel sounded ; and there were great voices in heaven , saying , The king@@ doms of this world are become the king@@ doms of our Lord , and of his Christ ; and he shall reign for ever and ever .
and the four and twenty elders , which sat before God on their seats , fell upon their faces , and wor@@ shipped God ,
and the temple of God was opened in heaven , and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament : and there were light@@ nings , and voices , and thunder@@ ings , and an earthquake , and great hail .
and there appeared another wonder in heaven ; and behold a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and seven crow@@ ns upon his heads .
and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven , Now is come salvation , and strength , and the kingdom of our God , and the power of his Christ : for the acc@@ user of our brethren is cast down , which accused them before our God day and night .
and the beast which I saw was like unto a le@@ op@@ ard , and his feet were as the feet of a bear , and his mouth as the mouth of a lion : and the dragon gave him his power , and his seat , and great authority .
and he opened his mouth in bl@@ asph@@ emy against God , to bl@@ asph@@ eme his name , and his tab@@ ern@@ acle , and them that dwell in heaven .
and I heard a voice from heaven , as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of a great thunder : and I heard the voice of Har@@ pers har@@ ping with their har@@ ps :
and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me , Write , Bless@@ ed are the dead which die in the Lord from h@@ ence@@ forth : ye@@ a , sa@@ ith the Spirit , that they may rest from their lab@@ ours ; and their works do follow them .
and he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sick@@ le on the earth ; and the earth was re@@ aped .
and another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven , he also having a sharp sick@@ le .
and the angel thrust in his sick@@ le into the earth , and gathered the vine of the earth , and cast it into the great win@@ ep@@ ress of the wrath of God .
and I saw another sign in heaven , great and marv@@ ell@@ ous , seven angels having the seven last pl@@ agues ; for in them is filled up the wrath of God .
who shall not fear thee , O Lord , and glori@@ fy thy name ? for thou only art holy : for all nations shall come and worship before thee ; for thy judgments are made manifest .
and the first went , and poured out his vial upon the earth ; and there fell a nois@@ ome and griev@@ ous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast , and upon them which wor@@ shipped his image .
and the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea ; and it became as the blood of a dead man : and every living soul died in the sea .
and the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and foun@@ tains of waters ; and they became blood .
and the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun ; and power was given unto him to scor@@ ch men with fire .
and the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast ; and his kingdom was full of darkness ; and they gn@@ aw@@ ed their tongues for pain ,
and bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed the God of heaven because of their pains and their so@@ res , and rep@@ ented not of their deeds .
and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river E@@ uph@@ rates ; and the water thereof was dried up , that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared .
behold , I come as a thief . blessed is he that watch@@ eth , and keep@@ eth his garments , lest he walk naked , and they see his shame .
and the fruits that thy soul lu@@ sted after are departed from thee , and all things which were d@@ ain@@ ty and goo@@ dly are departed from thee , and thou shalt find them no more at all .
and after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven , saying , All@@ elu@@ ia ; Sal@@ vation , and glory , and honour , and power , unto the Lord our God :
and the sea gave up the dead which were in it ; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them : and they were judged every man according to their works .
in the midst of the street of it , and on either side of the river , was there the tree of life , which bare twelve manner of fruits , and yielded her fruit every month : and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
