for I know nothing by myself ; yet am I not hereby justified : but he that judgeth me is the Lord .
but them that are without God judgeth . therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person .
know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God ? be not deceived : neither fornicators , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor effeminate , nor abusers of themselves with mankind ,
judge in yourselves : is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered ?
but let a man examine himself , and so let him eat of that bread , and drink of that cup .
for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily , eateth and drinketh damnation to himself , not discerning the Lord 's body .
charity suffereth long , and is kind ; charity envieth not ; charity vaunteth not itself , is not puffed up ,
but we had the sentence of death in ourselves , that we should not trust in ourselves , but in God which raiseth the dead :
but I determined this with myself , that I would not come again to you in heaviness .
not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves ; but our sufficiency is of God ;
for we preach not ourselves , but Christ Jesus the Lord ; and ourselves your servants for Jesus ' sake .
for we commend not ourselves again unto you , but give you occasion to glory on our behalf , that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance , and not in heart .
for whether we be beside ourselves , it is to God : or whether we be sober , it is for your cause .
and that he died for all , that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves , but unto him which died for them , and rose again .
for we dare not make ourselves of the number , or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves : but they measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves among themselves , are not wise .
for not he that commendeth himself is approved , but whom the Lord commendeth .
and no marvel ; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light .
for ye suffer fools gladly , seeing ye yourselves are wise .
for all the law is fulfilled in one word , even in this ; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
for if a man think himself to be something , when he is nothing , he deceiveth himself .
but let every man prove his own work , and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone , and not in another .
having made known unto us the mystery of his will , according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself :
for by grace are ye saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves : it is the gift of God :
having abolished in his flesh the enmity , even the law of commandments contained in ordinances ; for to make in himself of twain one new man , so making peace ;
and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone ;
from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth , according to the effectual working in the measure of every part , maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love .
and walk in love , as Christ also hath loved us , and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour .
speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord ;
that he might present it to himself a glorious church , not having spot , or wrinkle , or any such thing ; but that it should be holy and without blemish .
nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself ; and the wife see that she reverence her husband .
let nothing be done through strife or vainglory ; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves .
but I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly .
who shall change our vile body , that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body , according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself .
for yourselves , brethren , know our entrance in unto you , that it was not in vain :
now God himself and our Father , and our Lord Jesus Christ , direct our way unto you .
but as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you : for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another .
for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the archangel , and with the trump of God : and the dead in Christ shall rise first :
and to esteem them very highly in love for their work 's sake . and be at peace among yourselves .
see that none render evil for evil unto any man ; but ever follow that which is good , both among yourselves , and to all men .
now our Lord Jesus Christ himself , and God , even our Father , which hath loved us , and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace ,
for yourselves know how ye ought to follow us : for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you ;
now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means . the Lord be with you all .
take heed unto thyself , and unto the doctrine ; continue in them : for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself , and them that hear thee .
one of themselves , even a prophet of their own , said , The Cretians are alway liars , evil beasts , slow bellies .
who gave himself for us , that he might redeem us from all iniquity , and purify unto himself a peculiar people , zealous of good works .
if thou count me therefore a partner , receive him as myself .
and by reason hereof he ought , as for the people , so also for himself , to offer for sins .
and no man taketh this honour unto himself , but he that is called of God , as was Aaron .
so also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest ; but he that said unto him , Thou art my Son , to day have I begotten thee .
for when God made promise to Abraham , because he could swear by no greater , he sware by himself ,
who needeth not daily , as those high priests , to offer up sacrifice , first for his own sins , and then for the people 's : for this he did once , when he offered up himself .
but into the second went the high priest alone once every year , not without blood , which he offered for himself , and for the errors of the people :
for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself .
not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together , as the manner of some is ; but exhorting one another : and so much the more , as ye see the day approaching .
for ye had compassion of me in my bonds , and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods , knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance .
for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself , lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds .
remember them that are in bonds , as bound with them ; and them which suffer adversity , as being yourselves also in the body .
are ye not then partial in yourselves , and are become judges of evil thoughts ?
if ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself , ye do well :
and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves : for charity shall cover the multitude of sins .
but there were false prophets also among the people , even as there shall be false teachers among you , who privily shall bring in damnable heresies , even denying the Lord that bought them , and bring upon themselves swift destruction .
he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk , even as he walked .
and every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself , even as he is pure .
he that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself : he that believeth not God hath made him a liar ; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son .
we know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not ; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself , and that wicked one toucheth him not .
look to yourselves , that we lose not those things which we have wrought , but that we receive a full reward .
but ye , beloved , building up yourselves on your most holy faith , praying in the Holy Ghost ,
