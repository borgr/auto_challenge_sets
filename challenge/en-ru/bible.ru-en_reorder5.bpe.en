God called the light " day , " and the darkness he called " night . " there was evening and there was morning , one day .
God said , " Let there be an expan@@ se in the middle of the waters , and let it divide the waters from the waters . "
God called the dry land " earth , " and the gathering together of the waters he called " seas . " God saw that it was good .
God said , " Let the earth yield grass , herbs yielding seed , and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind , with its seed in it , on the earth " ; and it was so .
God said , " Let there be lights in the expan@@ se of sky to divide the day from the night ; and let them be for signs , and for seasons , and for days and years ;
and let them be for lights in the expan@@ se of sky to give light on the earth " ; and it was so .
and to rule over the day and over the night , and to divide the light from the darkness . God saw that it was good .
God said , " Let the waters s@@ warm with s@@ war@@ ms of living creatures , and let birds fly above the earth in the open expan@@ se of sky . "
God made the animals of the earth after their kind , and the livestock after their kind , and everything that cre@@ eps on the ground after its kind . God saw that it was good .
to every animal of the earth , and to every bird of the sky , and to everything that cre@@ eps on the earth , in which there is life , I have given every green her@@ b for food " ; and it was so .
this is the history of the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created , in the day that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h God made the earth and the heavens .
and the gold of that land is good . there is aromatic res@@ in and the ony@@ x stone .
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , you shall not eat of it ; for in the day that you eat of it you will surely die . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h God said , " It is not good that the man should be alone ; I will make him a hel@@ per suitable for him . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man , and he slept ; and he took one of his ri@@ bs , and closed up the flesh in its place .
he made the ri@@ b , which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h God had taken from the man , into a woman , and brought her to the man .
the man said , " This is now bone of my bones , and flesh of my flesh . she will be called ' woman , ' because she was taken out of Man . "
therefore a man will leave his father and his mother , and will join with his wife , and they will be one flesh .
now the ser@@ pent was more subtle than any animal of the field which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h God had made . he said to the woman , " Has God really said , ' You shall not eat of any tree of the garden ? ' "
they heard the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h God walking in the garden in the cool of the day , and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h God among the trees of the garden .
the man said , " I heard your voice in the garden , and I was afraid , because I was naked ; and I hid myself . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h God said to the woman , " What is this you have done ? " the woman said , " The ser@@ pent deceived me , and I ate . "
to the woman he said , " I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth . in pain you will bear children . your desire will be for your husband , and he will rule over you . "
it will yield thor@@ ns and th@@ ist@@ les to you ; and you will eat the her@@ b of the field .
by the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you return to the ground , for out of it you were taken . for you are dust , and to dust you shall return . "
again she gave birth , to C@@ ain 's brother A@@ bel . A@@ bel was a keeper of sheep , but C@@ ain was a til@@ ler of the ground .
if you do well , will it not be lifted up ? if you don '@@ t do well , sin c@@ rou@@ ches at the door . its desire is for you , but you are to rule over it . "
C@@ ain said to A@@ bel , his brother , " Let 's go into the field . " it happened when they were in the field , that C@@ ain rose up against A@@ bel , his brother , and killed him .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to C@@ ain , " Where is A@@ bel , your brother ? " he said , " I don '@@ t know . am I my brother 's keeper ? "
from now on , when you till the ground , it won '@@ t yield its strength to you . you shall be a fu@@ gi@@ tive and a wan@@ der@@ er in the earth . "
behold , you have driven me out this day from the surface of the ground . I will be hidden from your face , and I will be a fu@@ gi@@ tive and a wan@@ der@@ er in the earth . it will happen that whoever finds me will kill me . "
Z@@ il@@ lah also gave birth to tu@@ bal C@@ ain , the for@@ ger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron . tu@@ bal C@@ ain 's sister was Na@@ am@@ ah .
Lam@@ ech said to his wives , " Ad@@ ah and Z@@ il@@ lah , hear my voice . you wives of Lam@@ ech , listen to my speech , for I have sl@@ ain a man for w@@ ounding me , a young man for bru@@ ising me .
Adam lived one hundred thirty years , and became the father of a son in his own lik@@ eness , after his image , and named him S@@ eth .
E@@ no@@ ch walked with God after he became the father of Meth@@ us@@ el@@ ah three hundred years , and became the father of sons and daughters .
and he named him Noah , saying , " This same will comfort us in our work and in the to@@ il of our hands , because of the ground which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has cur@@ sed . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , " My Spirit will not strive with man forever , because he also is flesh ; yet will his days be one hundred twenty years . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , " I will destroy man whom I have created from the surface of the ground ; man , along with animals , cre@@ eping things , and birds of the sky ; for I am sorry that I have made them . "
God said to Noah , " The end of all flesh has come before me , for the earth is filled with violence through them . behold , I will destroy them with the earth .
make a ship of g@@ op@@ her wood . you shall make rooms in the ship , and shall seal it inside and outside with pitch .
this is how you shall make it . the length of the ship will be three hundred cub@@ its , its breadth fifty cub@@ its , and its height thirty cub@@ its .
you shall make a roof in the ship , and you shall finish it to a cub@@ it upward . you shall set the door of the ship in its side . you shall make it with lower , second , and third levels .
take with you of all food that is eaten , and gather it to yourself ; and it will be for food for you , and for them . "
you shall take seven pairs of every clean animal with you , the male and his female . of the animals that are not clean , take two , the male and his female .
also of the birds of the sky , seven and seven , male and female , to keep seed alive on the surface of all the earth .
in seven days , I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights . every living thing that I have made , I will destroy from the surface of the ground . "
in the same day Noah , and She@@ m , H@@ am , and Jap@@ h@@ eth , the sons of Noah , and Noah 's wife , and the three wives of his sons with them , entered into the ship ;
the flood was forty days on the earth . the waters increased , and lifted up the ship , and it was lifted up above the earth .
the waters prevailed , and increased greatly on the earth ; and the ship floated on the surface of the waters .
he sent out a do@@ ve from him , to see if the waters were abated from the surface of the ground ,
but the do@@ ve found no place to rest her foot , and she returned to him into the ship ; for the waters were on the surface of the whole earth . he put out his hand , and took her , and brought her to him into the ship .
the do@@ ve came back to him at evening , and , behold , in her mouth was an olive leaf pl@@ ucked off . so Noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth .
in the second month , on the twenty @@@ -@@ @ seventh day of the month , the earth was dry .
" go out of the ship , you , and your wife , and your sons , and your sons ' wives with you .
bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh , including birds , livestock , and every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ eps on the earth , that they may breed ab@@ und@@ antly in the earth , and be fruitful , and multiply on the earth . "
while the earth remains , seed time and harvest , and cold and heat , and summer and winter , and day and night shall not cease . "
the fear of you and the dre@@ ad of you will be on every animal of the earth , and on every bird of the sky . everything that the ground te@@ ems with , and all the fish of the sea are delivered into your hand .
I will surely require your blood of your lives . at the hand of every animal I will require it . at the hand of man , even at the hand of every man 's brother , I will require the life of man .
" as for me , behold , I establish my covenant with you , and with your offspring after you ,
I set my rain@@ bow in the cloud , and it will be for a sign of a covenant between me and the earth .
it will happen , when I bring a cloud over the earth , that the rain@@ bow will be seen in the cloud ,
the rain@@ bow will be in the cloud . I will look at it , that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth . "
God said to Noah , " This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth . "
She@@ m and Jap@@ h@@ eth took a garment , and laid it on both their shoulders , went in backwards , and covered the n@@ ak@@ edness of their father . their faces were backwards , and they did@@ n '@@ t see their father 's n@@ ak@@ edness .
the border of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites was from Sid@@ on , as you go toward Ger@@ ar , to Gaza ; as you go toward So@@ dom , Gom@@ or@@ rah , Ad@@ ma@@ h , and Ze@@ bo@@ i@@ im , to L@@ asha .
to E@@ ber were born two sons . the name of the one was P@@ ele@@ g , for in his days the earth was divided . his brother 's name was Jo@@ k@@ tan .
these are the families of the sons of Noah , after their generations , in their nations . of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood .
they said one to another , " Come , let 's make bricks , and burn them thoroughly . " they had brick for stone , and they used tar for mortar .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , " Be@@ hold , they are one people , and they have all one language , and this is what they begin to do . now nothing will be with@@ held from them , which they intend to do .
so Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth . they stopped building the city .
therefore its name was called Bab@@ el , because there Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h confused the language of all the earth . from there , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth .
Ab@@ ram and N@@ ah@@ or took wives . the name of Ab@@ ram 's wife was Sar@@ ai , and the name of N@@ ah@@ or 's wife , Mil@@ ca@@ h , the daughter of Har@@ an who was also the father of Is@@ ca@@ h .
now Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Ab@@ ram , " Get out of your country , and from your relatives , and from your father 's house , to the land that I will show you .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h appeared to Ab@@ ram and said , " I will give this land to your seed . " he built an altar there to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , who appeared to him .
there was a famine in the land . Ab@@ ram went down into Egypt to live as a foreigner there , for the famine was severe in the land .
it happened , when he had come near to enter Egypt , that he said to Sar@@ ai his wife , " See now , I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at .
please say that you are my sister , that it may be well with me for your sake , and that my soul may live because of you . "
why did you say , ' She is my sister , ' so that I took her to be my wife ? now therefore , see your wife , take her , and go your way . "
to the place of the altar , which he had made there at the first . there Ab@@ ram called on the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
there was a strife between the her@@ d@@ smen of Ab@@ ram 's livestock and the her@@ d@@ smen of L@@ ot 's livestock : and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite lived in the land at that time .
Ab@@ ram said to L@@ ot , " Please , let there be no strife between me and you , and between my her@@ d@@ smen and your her@@ d@@ smen ; for we are relatives .
lot lifted up his eyes , and saw all the plain of the Jordan , that it was well @@@ -@@ @ wat@@ ered everywhere , before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h destroyed So@@ dom and Gom@@ or@@ rah , like the garden of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , like the land of Egypt , as you go to Zo@@ ar .
Ab@@ ram lived in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and L@@ ot lived in the cities of the plain , and moved his tent as far as So@@ dom .
I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth , so that if a man can number the dust of the earth , then your seed may also be numbered .
that they made war with B@@ era , king of So@@ dom , and with Bir@@ sha , king of Gom@@ or@@ rah , Shin@@ ab , king of Ad@@ ma@@ h , and Sh@@ em@@ e@@ ber , king of Ze@@ bo@@ i@@ im , and the king of Bel@@ a ( the same is Zo@@ ar ) .
all these joined together in the valley of Sid@@ dim ( the same is the Salt Sea ) .
in the four@@ teenth year Ch@@ ed@@ or@@ la@@ om@@ er came , and the kings who were with him , and struck the Rep@@ ha@@ im in Ash@@ ter@@ o@@ th Kar@@ n@@ aim , and the Z@@ uz@@ im in H@@ am , and the E@@ mi@@ m in Sha@@ ve@@ h Kiri@@ ath@@ aim ,
they took all the goods of So@@ dom and Gom@@ or@@ rah , and all their food , and went their way .
one who had escaped came and told Ab@@ ram , the Hebrew . now he lived by the o@@ aks of Mam@@ re , the A@@ mor@@ ite , brother of E@@ sh@@ col , and brother of An@@ er ; and these were allies of Ab@@ ram .
the king of So@@ dom said to Ab@@ ram , " Gi@@ ve me the people , and take the goods to yourself . "
Ab@@ ram said to the king of So@@ dom , " I have lifted up my hand to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , God Most High , poss@@ essor of heaven and earth ,
that I will not take a thread nor a sand@@ al str@@ ap nor anything that is yours , lest you should say , ' I have made Ab@@ ram rich . '
I will accept nothing from you except that which the young men have eaten , and the portion of the men who went with me : An@@ er , E@@ sh@@ col , and Mam@@ re . let them take their portion . "
after these things the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came to Ab@@ ram in a vision , saying , " Don '@@ t be afraid , Ab@@ ram . I am your shield , your exceedingly great reward . "
Ab@@ ram said , " Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , what will you give me , since I go chil@@ dless , and he who will inherit my estate is Eli@@ ez@@ er of Damascus ? "
Ab@@ ram said , " Be@@ hold , to me you have given no seed : and , behold , one born in my house is my heir . "
behold , the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came to him , saying , " This man will not be your heir , but he who will come out of your own body will be your heir . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h brought him outside , and said , " Look now toward the sky , and count the stars , if you are able to count them . " he said to Ab@@ ram , " So shall your seed be . "
he said to him , " I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h who brought you out of U@@ r of the Chal@@ de@@ es , to give you this land to inherit it . "
he brought him all of these , and divided them in the middle , and laid each half opposite the other ; but he did@@ n '@@ t divide the birds .
he said to Ab@@ ram , " Know for sure that your seed will live as foreigners in a land that is not theirs , and will serve them . they will aff@@ l@@ ict them four hundred years .
in the fourth generation they will come here again , for the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the A@@ mor@@ ite is not yet full . "
it came to pass that , when the sun went down , and it was dark , behold , a smoking furnace , and a fl@@ aming torch passed between these pieces .
in that day Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h made a covenant with Ab@@ ram , saying , " To your seed I have given this land , from the river of Egypt to the great river , the river E@@ uph@@ rates :
now Sar@@ ai , Ab@@ ram 's wife , bore him no children . she had a hand@@ maid , an Egyptian , whose name was Hag@@ ar .
but Ab@@ ram said to Sar@@ ai , " Be@@ hold , your maid is in your hand . do to her whatever is good in your eyes . " Sar@@ ai dealt harsh@@ ly with her , and she fled from her face .
the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness , by the fountain in the way to Sh@@ ur .
he said , " Hag@@ ar , Sar@@ ai 's hand@@ maid , where did you come from ? where are you going ? " she said , " I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sar@@ ai . "
the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to her , " Be@@ hold , you are with child , and will bear a son . you shall call his name I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , because Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has heard your afflic@@ tion .
he will be like a wild don@@ key among men . his hand will be against every man , and every man 's hand against him . he will live opposite all of his brothers . "
when Ab@@ ram was ninety @@@ -@@ @ nine years old , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h appeared to Ab@@ ram , and said to him , " I am God Almighty . walk before me , and be bl@@ am@@ eless .
neither will your name any more be called Ab@@ ram , but your name will be Abraham ; for I have made you the father of a multitude of nations .
I will give to you , and to your seed after you , the land where you are traveling , all the land of Can@@ a@@ an , for an everlasting possession . I will be their God . "
he who is born in your house , and he who is bought with your money , must be circum@@ c@@ ised . my covenant will be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant .
the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised male who is not circum@@ c@@ ised in the flesh of his fores@@ kin , that soul shall be cut off from his people . he has broken my covenant . "
then Abraham fell on his face , and laughed , and said in his heart , " Will a child be born to him who is one hundred years old ? will Sarah , who is ninety years old , give birth ? "
God said , " No , but Sarah , your wife , will bear you a son . you shall call his name Isaac . I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him .
Abraham took I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el his son , all who were born in his house , and all who were bought with his money ; every male among the men of Abraham 's house , and circum@@ c@@ ised the flesh of their fores@@ kin in the same day , as God had said to him .
Abraham was ninety @@@ -@@ @ nine years old , when he was circum@@ c@@ ised in the flesh of his fores@@ kin .
all the men of his house , those born in the house , and those bought with money of a foreigner , were circum@@ c@@ ised with him .
and said , " My lord , if now I have found favor in your sight , please don '@@ t go away from your servant .
Abraham hur@@ ried into the tent to Sarah , and said , " Quick@@ ly prepare three measures of fine meal , kne@@ ad it , and make cakes . "
they asked him , " Where is Sarah , your wife ? " he said , " See , in the tent . "
is anything too hard for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ? at the set time I will return to you , when the season comes round , and Sarah will have a son . "
since Abraham has surely become a great and mighty nation , and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him ?
for I have known him , to the end that he may command his children and his household after him , that they may keep the way of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to do righteousness and justice ; to the end that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him . "
I will go down now , and see whether their deeds are as bad as the reports which have come to me . if not , I will know . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , " If I find in So@@ dom fifty righteous within the city , then I will spare all the place for their sake . "
Abraham answered , " See now , I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord , who am but dust and ashes .
what if there will lack five of the fifty righteous ? will you destroy all the city for lack of five ? " he said , " I will not destroy it , if I find forty @@@ -@@ @ five there . "
he spoke to him yet again , and said , " What if there are forty found there ? " he said , " I will not do it for the forty 's sake . "
he said , " Oh don '@@ t let the Lord be angry , and I will speak . what if there are thirty found there ? " he said , " I will not do it , if I find thirty there . "
the two angels came to So@@ dom at evening . lot sat in the gate of So@@ dom . lot saw them , and rose up to meet them . he bowed himself with his face to the earth ,
but before they lay down , the men of the city , the men of So@@ dom , surrounded the house , both young and old , all the people from every quarter .
when the morning came , then the angels hur@@ ried L@@ ot , saying , " Get up ! take your wife , and your two daughters who are here , lest you be consumed in the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the city . "
but he ling@@ ered ; and the men grabbed his hand , his wife 's hand , and his two daughters ' hands , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h being mer@@ ciful to him ; and they took him out , and set him outside of the city .
it came to pass , when they had taken them out , that he said , " Es@@ cape for your life ! Don '@@ t look behind you , and don '@@ t stay anywhere in the plain . escape to the mountains , lest you be consumed ! "
he said to him , " Be@@ hold , I have granted your request concerning this thing also , that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken .
he looked toward So@@ dom and Gom@@ or@@ rah , and toward all the land of the plain , and looked , and saw that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace .
it happened , when God destroyed the cities of the plain , that God remembered Abraham , and sent L@@ ot out of the middle of the overthrow , when he over@@ threw the cities in which L@@ ot lived .
the fir@@ st@@ born said to the younger , " Our father is old , and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us in the way of all the earth .
the younger also bore a son , and called his name Ben Am@@ mi . he is the father of the children of Am@@ mon to this day .
Abraham traveled from there toward the land of the South , and lived between Kad@@ esh and Sh@@ ur . he lived as a foreigner in Ger@@ ar .
did@@ n '@@ t he tell me , ' She is my sister ? ' she , even she herself , said , ' He is my brother . ' in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands have I done this . "
God said to him in the dream , " Yes , I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this , and I also with@@ held you from s@@ inning against me . therefore I did@@ n '@@ t allow you to touch her .
now therefore , restore the man 's wife . for he is a prophet , and he will pray for you , and you will live . if you don '@@ t restore her , know for sure that you will die , you , and all who are yours . "
to Sarah he said , " Be@@ hold , I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver . behold , it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you . in front of all you are v@@ indicated . "
Sarah conceived , and bore Abraham a son in his old age , at the set time of which God had spoken to him .
she said , " Who would have said to Abraham , that Sarah would nurse children ? for I have borne him a son in his old age . "
therefore she said to Abraham , " C@@ ast out this hand@@ maid and her son ! for the son of this hand@@ maid will not be heir with my son , Isaac . "
I will also make a nation of the son of the hand@@ maid , because he is your seed . "
Abraham rose up early in the morning , and took bread and a bottle of water , and gave it to Hag@@ ar , putting it on her shoulder ; and gave her the child , and sent her away . she departed , and wan@@ dered in the wilderness of Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba .
she went and sat down opposite him , a good way off , about a bow shot away . for she said , " Don '@@ t let me see the death of the child . " she sat over against him , and lifted up her voice , and we@@ pt .
God heard the voice of the boy . the angel of God called to Hag@@ ar out of the sky , and said to her , " What ails you , Hag@@ ar ? Don '@@ t be afraid . for God has heard the voice of the boy where he is .
get up , lift up the boy , and hold him in your hand . for I will make him a great nation . "
he lived in the wilderness of Par@@ an . his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt .
he said , " You shall take these seven e@@ we lam@@ bs from my hand , that it may be a witness to me , that I have dug this well . "
so they made a covenant at Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba . Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h rose up with Ph@@ ic@@ ol , the captain of his army , and they returned into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
Abraham planted a tam@@ ar@@ isk tree in Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba , and called there on the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the Ever@@ lasting God .
it happened after these things , that God tested Abraham , and said to him , " Abraham ! " he said , " Here I am . "
Abraham rose early in the morning , and sadd@@ led his don@@ key , and took two of his young men with him , and Isaac his son . he split the wood for the burnt offering , and rose up , and went to the place of which God had told him .
Abraham said to his young men , " Stay here with the don@@ key . the boy and I will go y@@ on@@ der . we will worship , and come back to you . "
Abraham said , " God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering , my son . " so they both went together .
they came to the place which God had told him of . Abraham built the altar there , and laid the wood in order , bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar , on the wood .
the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h called to him out of the sky , and said , " Abraham , Abraham ! " he said , " Here I am . "
he said , " Don '@@ t lay your hand on the boy , neither do anything to him . for now I know that you fear God , since you have not with@@ held your son , your only son , from me . "
Abraham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and saw that behind him was a ram caught in the th@@ icket by his horns . Abraham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son .
that I will bless you greatly , and I will multiply your seed greatly like the stars of the heavens , and like the sand which is on the se@@ ash@@ ore . your seed will possess the gate of his enemies .
it happened after these things , that it was told Abraham , saying , " Be@@ hold , Mil@@ ca@@ h , she also has borne children to your brother N@@ ah@@ or :
" I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you . give me a possession of a bur@@ ying @@@ -@@ @ place with you , that I may bury my dead out of my sight . "
he talked with them , saying , " If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight , hear me , and entre@@ at for me to E@@ ph@@ ron the son of Zo@@ har ,
that he may give me the cave of Mach@@ pel@@ ah , which he has , which is in the end of his field . for the full price let him give it to me among you for a possession of a bur@@ ying @@@ -@@ @ place . "
" no , my lord , hear me . I give you the field , and I give you the cave that is in it . in the presence of the children of my people I give it to you . bury your dead . "
" my lord , listen to me . what is a piece of land worth four hundred she@@ k@@ els of silver between me and you ? therefore bury your dead . "
Abraham listened to E@@ ph@@ ron . Abraham weighed to E@@ ph@@ ron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of H@@ eth , four hundred she@@ k@@ els of silver , according to the current merchants ' standard .
so the field of E@@ ph@@ ron , which was in Mach@@ pel@@ ah , which was before Mam@@ re , the field , the cave which was in it , and all the trees that were in the field , that were in all of its borders , were de@@ eded
the field , and the cave that is in it , were de@@ eded to Abraham for a possession of a bur@@ ying place by the children of H@@ eth .
but you shall go to my country , and to my relatives , and take a wife for my son Isaac . "
if the woman is@@ n '@@ t willing to follow you , then you shall be clear from this my oath . only you shall not bring my son there again . "
the servant took ten cam@@ els , of his master 's cam@@ els , and departed , having a variety of good things of his master 's with him . he arose , and went to Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , to the city of N@@ ah@@ or .
he made the cam@@ els kne@@ el down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening , the time that women go out to draw water .
he said , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of my master Abraham , please give me success this day , and show kindness to my master Abraham .
it happened , before he had finished speaking , that behold , Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah came out , who was born to Beth@@ u@@ el the son of Mil@@ ca@@ h , the wife of N@@ ah@@ or , Abraham 's brother , with her p@@ itch@@ er on her shoulder .
the young lady was very beautiful to look at , a virgin , neither had any man known her . she went down to the spring , filled her p@@ itch@@ er , and came up .
the servant ran to meet her , and said , " Please give me a drink , a little water from your p@@ itch@@ er . "
she said , " Dr@@ ink , my lord . " she hur@@ ried , and let down her p@@ itch@@ er on her hand , and gave him drink .
when she had done giving him drink , she said , " I will also draw for your cam@@ els , until they have done drinking . "
it happened , as the cam@@ els had done drinking , that the man took a golden ring of half a she@@ kel weight , and two brac@@ elets for her hands of ten she@@ k@@ els weight of gold ,
and said , " Wh@@ ose daughter are you ? please tell me . is there room in your father 's house for us to lodge in ? "
the man came into the house , and he un@@ loaded the cam@@ els . he gave straw and pro@@ ven@@ der for the cam@@ els , and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him .
food was set before him to eat , but he said , " I will not eat until I have told my message . " he said , " Spe@@ ak on . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has blessed my master greatly . he has become great . he has given him f@@ locks and herds , silver and gold , male servants and female servants , and cam@@ els and don@@ keys .
Sarah , my master 's wife , bore a son to my master when she was old . he has given all that he has to him .
my master made me swear , saying , ' You shall not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , in whose land I live ,
but you shall go to my father 's house , and to my relatives , and take a wife for my son . '
he said to me , ' Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , before whom I walk , will send his angel with you , and prosper your way . you shall take a wife for my son of my relatives , and of my father 's house .
then will you be clear from my oath , when you come to my relatives . if they don '@@ t give her to you , you shall be clear from my oath . '
before I had finished speaking in my heart , behold , Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah came out with her p@@ itch@@ er on her shoulder . she went down to the spring , and drew . I said to her , ' Please let me drink . '
I asked her , and said , ' Wh@@ ose daughter are you ? ' she said , ' The daughter of Beth@@ u@@ el , N@@ ah@@ or 's son , whom Mil@@ ca@@ h bore to him . ' I put the ring on her nose , and the brac@@ elets on her hands .
I bowed my head , and worshi@@ ped Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and blessed Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of my master Abraham , who had led me in the right way to take my master 's brother 's daughter for his son .
now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master , tell me . if not , tell me , that I may turn to the right hand , or to the left . "
behold , Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah is before you . take her , and go , and let her be your master 's son 's wife , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken . "
the servant brought out jew@@ els of silver , and jew@@ els of gold , and clothing , and gave them to Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah . he also gave precious things to her brother and her mother .
they ate and drank , he and the men who were with him , and stayed all night . they rose up in the morning , and he said , " Send me away to my master . "
her brother and her mother said , " Let the young lady stay with us a few days , at least ten . after that she will go . "
he said to them , " Don '@@ t hinder me , since Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has prosper@@ ed my way . send me away that I may go to my master . "
Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening . he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , behold , there were cam@@ els coming .
Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah lifted up her eyes , and when she saw Isaac , she dis@@ mounted from the cam@@ el .
she said to the servant , " Who is the man who is walking in the field to meet us ? " the servant said , " It is my master . " she took her veil , and covered herself .
Jo@@ k@@ shan became the father of She@@ ba , and D@@ ed@@ an . the sons of D@@ ed@@ an were As@@ sh@@ ur@@ im , Let@@ us@@ him , and Le@@ um@@ mi@@ m .
the sons of Mi@@ dian : ep@@ ha@@ h , E@@ ph@@ er , H@@ ano@@ ch , Ab@@ ida , and El@@ da@@ ah . all these were the children of K@@ et@@ ur@@ ah .
Abraham gave up the spirit , and died in a good old age , an old man , and full of years , and was gathered to his people .
Isaac and I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , his sons , buried him in the cave of Mach@@ pel@@ ah , in the field of E@@ ph@@ ron , the son of Zo@@ har the Hit@@ tite , which is before Mam@@ re ,
these are the names of the sons of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , by their names , according to the order of their birth : the fir@@ st@@ born of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , Ne@@ bai@@ o@@ th , then K@@ edar , Ad@@ be@@ el , Mi@@ b@@ s@@ am ,
these are the sons of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , and these are their names , by their villages , and by their enc@@ amp@@ ments : twelve princes , according to their nations .
these are the years of the life of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el : one hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ seven years . he gave up the spirit and died , and was gathered to his people .
Isaac was forty years old when he took Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah , the daughter of Beth@@ u@@ el the Syrian of P@@ add@@ an A@@ ram , the sister of Lab@@ an the Syrian , to be his wife .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to her , " Two nations are in your womb . two peoples will be separated from your body . the one people will be stronger than the other people . the elder will serve the younger . "
Es@@ au said , " Be@@ hold , I am about to die . what good is the birth@@ right to me ? "
live in this land , and I will be with you , and will bless you . for to you , and to your seed , I will give all these lands , and I will establish the oath which I s@@ wore to Abraham your father .
it happened , when he had been there a long time , that Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h king of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines looked out at a window , and saw , and , behold , Isaac was ca@@ ressing Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah , his wife .
Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h said , " What is this you have done to us ? one of the people might easily have lain with your wife , and you would have brought guilt on us ! "
now all the wells which his father 's servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father , the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had stopped , and filled with earth .
the her@@ d@@ smen of Ger@@ ar argued with Isaac 's her@@ d@@ smen , saying , " The water is ours . " he called the name of the well E@@ se@@ k , because they cont@@ ended with him .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h appeared to him the same night , and said , " I am the God of Abraham your father . Don '@@ t be afraid , for I am with you , and will bless you , and multiply your seed for my servant Abraham 's sake . "
Isaac said to them , " Why have you come to me , since you hate me , and have sent me away from you ? "
they said , " We saw plainly that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was with you . we said , ' Let there now be an oath between us , even between us and you , and let us make a covenant with you ,
that you will do us no harm , as we have not touched you , and as we have done to you nothing but good , and have sent you away in peace . ' you are now the blessed of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
they rose up some time in the morning , and s@@ wore one to another . Isaac sent them away , and they departed from him in peace .
it happened the same day , that Isaac 's servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had dug , and said to him , " We have found water . "
he said , " See now , I am old . I don '@@ t know the day of my death .
now therefore , please take your weapons , your qui@@ ver and your bow , and go out to the field , and take me ven@@ ison .
make me sav@@ ory food , such as I love , and bring it to me , that I may eat , and that my soul may bless you before I die . "
go now to the flock , and get me from there two good young goats . I will make them sav@@ ory food for your father , such as he loves .
you shall bring it to your father , that he may eat , so that he may bless you before his death . "
what if my father touches me ? I will seem to him as a decei@@ ver , and I would bring a curse on myself , and not a blessing . "
Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah took the good clothes of Es@@ au , her elder son , which were with her in the house , and put them on Jacob , her younger son .
he came to his father , and said , " My father ? " he said , " Here I am . who are you , my son ? "
Jacob said to his father , " I am Es@@ au your fir@@ st@@ born . I have done what you asked me to do . please arise , sit and eat of my ven@@ ison , that your soul may bless me . "
Isaac said to his son , " How is it that you have found it so quickly , my son ? " he said , " Because Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gave me success . "
Isaac said to Jacob , " Please come near , that I may feel you , my son , whether you are really my son Es@@ au or not . "
Jacob went near to Isaac his father . he felt him , and said , " The voice is Jacob 's voice , but the hands are the hands of Es@@ au . "
he said , " Are you really my son Es@@ au ? " he said , " I am . "
he said , " B@@ ring it near to me , and I will eat of my son 's ven@@ ison , that my soul may bless you . " he brought it near to him , and he ate . he brought him wine , and he drank .
he came near , and kis@@ sed him . he sm@@ elled the smell of his clothing , and blessed him , and said , " Be@@ hold , the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has blessed .
it happened , as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob , and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Es@@ au his brother came in from his hunting .
he also made sav@@ ory food , and brought it to his father . he said to his father , " Let my father arise , and eat of his son 's ven@@ ison , that your soul may bless me . "
when Es@@ au heard the words of his father , he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry , and said to his father , " B@@ less me , even me also , my father . "
Isaac answered Es@@ au , " Be@@ hold , I have made him your lord , and all his brothers have I given to him for servants . with grain and new wine have I sustained him . what then will I do for you , my son ? "
Isaac his father answered him , " Be@@ hold , of the fat@@ ness of the earth will be your dwelling , and of the de@@ w of the sky from above .
by your sword will you live , and you will serve your brother . it will happen , when you will break loose , that you shall shake his y@@ oke from off your neck . "
Es@@ au hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him . Es@@ au said in his heart , " The days of mourning for my father are at hand . then I will kill my brother Jacob . "
the words of Es@@ au , her elder son , were told to Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah . she sent and called Jacob , her younger son , and said to him , " Be@@ hold , your brother Es@@ au comforts himself about you by planning to kill you .
until your brother 's anger turn away from you , and he for@@ gets what you have done to him . then I will send , and get you from there . why should I be ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed of you both in one day ? "
Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah said to Isaac , " I am weary of my life because of the daughters of H@@ eth . if Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of H@@ eth , such as these , of the daughters of the land , what good will my life do me ? "
and give you the blessing of Abraham , to you , and to your seed with you , that you may inherit the land where you travel , which God gave to Abraham . "
Es@@ au went to I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , and took , besides the wives that he had , Ma@@ hal@@ ath the daughter of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , Abraham 's son , the sister of Ne@@ bai@@ o@@ th , to be his wife .
he came to a certain place , and stayed there all night , because the sun had set . he took one of the stones of the place , and put it under his head , and lay down in that place to sleep .
your seed will be as the dust of the earth , and you will spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south . in you and in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed .
Jacob awakened out of his sleep , and he said , " Su@@ rely Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is in this place , and I did@@ n '@@ t know it . "
he was afraid , and said , " How dreadful is this place ! this is none other than God 's house , and this is the gate of heaven . "
Jacob rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put under his head , and set it up for a pillar , and poured oil on its top .
Jacob vowed a vo@@ w , saying , " If God will be with me , and will keep me in this way that I go , and will give me bread to eat , and clothing to put on ,
he looked , and behold , a well in the field , and , behold , three f@@ locks of sheep lying there by it . for out of that well they wat@@ ered the f@@ locks . the stone on the well 's mouth was large .
there all the f@@ locks were gathered . they rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and wat@@ ered the sheep , and put the stone again on the well 's mouth in its place .
Jacob said to them , " My relatives , where are you from ? " they said , " We are from Har@@ an . "
he said to them , " Is it well with him ? " they said , " It is well . see , Rach@@ el , his daughter , is coming with the sheep . "
they said , " We can '@@ t , until all the f@@ locks are gathered together , and they roll the stone from the well 's mouth . then we water the sheep . "
it happened , when Jacob saw Rach@@ el the daughter of Lab@@ an , his mother 's brother , and the sheep of Lab@@ an , his mother 's brother , that Jacob went near , and rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and wat@@ ered the flock of Lab@@ an his mother 's brother .
it happened , when Lab@@ an heard the news of Jacob , his sister 's son , that he ran to meet Jacob , and embraced him , and kis@@ sed him , and brought him to his house . Jacob told Lab@@ an all these things .
Lab@@ an said , " It is better that I give her to you , than that I should give her to another man . stay with me . "
it happened in the evening , that he took Le@@ ah his daughter , and brought her to him . he went in to her .
it happened in the morning that , behold , it was Le@@ ah . he said to Lab@@ an , " What is this you have done to me ? did@@ n '@@ t I serve with you for Rach@@ el ? why then have you deceived me ? "
fulfill the week of this one , and we will give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me yet seven other years . "
she conceived again , and bore a son , and said , " Because Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has heard that I am hated , he has therefore given me this son also . " she named him Sim@@ eon .
she said , " Be@@ hold , my maid Bil@@ ha@@ h . go in to her , that she may bear on my knees , and I also may obtain children by her . "
Rach@@ el said , " God has judged me , and has also heard my voice , and has given me a son . " therefore called she his name Dan .
when Le@@ ah saw that she had finished bearing , she took Z@@ il@@ pa@@ h , her hand@@ maid , and gave her to Jacob as a wife .
Re@@ ub@@ en went in the days of wheat harvest , and found man@@ dr@@ akes in the field , and brought them to his mother , Le@@ ah . then Rach@@ el said to Le@@ ah , " Please give me some of your son 's man@@ dr@@ akes . "
she said to her , " Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband ? would you take away my son 's man@@ dr@@ akes , also ? " Rach@@ el said , " T@@ herefore he will lie with you tonight for your son 's man@@ dr@@ akes . "
Jacob came from the field in the evening , and Le@@ ah went out to meet him , and said , " You must come in to me ; for I have surely hired you with my son 's man@@ dr@@ akes . " he lay with her that night .
it happened , when Rach@@ el had borne Joseph , that Jacob said to Lab@@ an , " Send me away , that I may go to my own place , and to my country .
Lab@@ an said to him , " If now I have found favor in your eyes , stay here , for I have div@@ ined that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has blessed me for your sake . "
for it was little which you had before I came , and it has increased to a multitude . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has blessed you wherever I turned . now when will I provide for my own house also ? "
he said , " What shall I give you ? " Jacob said , " You shall not give me anything . if you will do this thing for me , I will again feed your flock and keep it .
that day , he removed the male goats that were stre@@ aked and spotted , and all the female goats that were spec@@ k@@ led and spotted , every one that had white in it , and all the black ones among the sheep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
he set the rods which he had pe@@ eled opposite the f@@ locks in the g@@ ut@@ ters in the wat@@ ering @@@ -@@ @ tr@@ ough@@ s where the f@@ locks came to drink . they conceived when they came to drink .
it happened , whenever the stronger of the flock conceived , that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the g@@ ut@@ ters , that they might conceive among the rods ;
but when the flock were fee@@ ble , he did@@ n '@@ t put them in . so the fee@@ bler were Lab@@ an 's , and the stronger Jacob 's .
the man increased exceedingly , and had large f@@ locks , female servants and male servants , and cam@@ els and don@@ keys .
he heard the words of Lab@@ an 's sons , saying , " Jacob has taken away all that was our father 's . from that which was our father 's , has he gotten all this wealth . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Jacob , " Return to the land of your fathers , and to your relatives , and I will be with you . "
it happened during m@@ ating season that I lifted up my eyes , and saw in a dream , and behold , the male goats which le@@ aped on the flock were stre@@ aked , spec@@ k@@ led , and gri@@ zz@@ led .
he said , ' Now lift up your eyes , and behold , all the male goats which leap on the flock are stre@@ aked , spec@@ k@@ led , and gri@@ zz@@ led , for I have seen all that Lab@@ an does to you .
I am the God of Be@@ the@@ l , where you ano@@ inted a pillar , where you vowed a vo@@ w to me . now arise , get out from this land , and return to the land of your birth . ' "
for all the riches which God has taken away from our father , that is ours and our children 's . now then , whatever God has said to you , do . "
so he fled with all that he had . he rose up , passed over the River , and set his face toward the mountain of Gil@@ e@@ ad .
it is in the power of my hand to hurt you , but the God of your father spoke to me last night , saying , ' Take heed to yourself that you don '@@ t speak to Jacob either good or bad . '
Lab@@ an went into Jacob 's tent , into Le@@ ah 's tent , and into the tent of the two female servants ; but he did@@ n '@@ t find them . he went out of Le@@ ah 's tent , and entered into Rach@@ el 's tent .
now Rach@@ el had taken the ter@@ ap@@ him , put them in the cam@@ el 's sadd@@ le , and sat on them . Lab@@ an felt about all the tent , but did@@ n '@@ t find them .
she said to her father , " Don '@@ t let my lord be angry that I can '@@ t rise up before you ; for I 'm having my period . " he searched , but did@@ n '@@ t find the ter@@ ap@@ him .
now that you have felt around in all my stuff , what have you found of all your household stuff ? set it here before my relatives and your relatives , that they may judge between us two .
" these twenty years I have been with you . your ew@@ es and your female goats have not cast their young , and I haven '@@ t eaten the r@@ ams of your f@@ locks .
that which was torn of animals , I did@@ n '@@ t bring to you . I bore its loss . of my hand you required it , whether stolen by day or stolen by night .
this was my situation : in the day the drought consumed me , and the frost by night ; and my sleep fled from my eyes .
may this heap be a witness , and the pillar be a witness , that I will not pass over this heap to you , and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me , for harm .
Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain , and called his relatives to eat bread . they ate bread , and stayed all night in the mountain .
when he saw them , Jacob said , " This is God 's army . " he called the name of that place Ma@@ han@@ aim .
Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Es@@ au , his brother , to the land of Se@@ ir , the field of E@@ dom .
the messengers returned to Jacob , saying , " We came to your brother Es@@ au . not only that , but he comes to meet you , and four hundred men with him . "
then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed . he divided the people who were with him , and the f@@ locks , and the herds , and the cam@@ els , into two companies ;
and he said , " If Es@@ au comes to the one company , and strikes it , then the company which is left will escape . "
Jacob said , " God of my father Abraham , and God of my father Isaac , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , who said to me , ' Return to your country , and to your relatives , and I will do you good , '
please deliver me from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Es@@ au : for I fear him , lest he come and strike me , and the mothers with the children .
he delivered them into the hands of his servants , every herd by itself , and said to his servants , " Pass over before me , and put a space between herd and herd . "
he commanded also the second , and the third , and all that followed the herds , saying , " This is how you shall speak to Es@@ au , when you find him .
you shall say , ' Not only that , but behold , your servant , Jacob , is behind us . ' " for , he said , " I will appe@@ ase him with the present that goes before me , and afterward I will see his face . perhaps he will accept me . "
when he saw that he did@@ n '@@ t prevail against him , he touched the hollow of his thi@@ gh , and the hollow of Jacob 's thi@@ gh was strained , as he wrest@@ led .
the man said , " Let me go , for the day breaks . " Jacob said , " I won '@@ t let you go , unless you bless me . "
he said , " Your name will no longer be called Jacob , but Israel ; for you have fought with God and with men , and have prevailed . "
Jacob lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , Es@@ au was coming , and with him four hundred men . he divided the children between Le@@ ah , Rach@@ el , and the two hand@@ m@@ aids .
Es@@ au said , " What do you mean by all this company which I met ? " Jacob said , " To find favor in the sight of my lord . "
Jacob said , " Please , no , if I have now found favor in your sight , then receive my present at my hand , because I have seen your face , as one sees the face of God , and you were pleased with me .
please take the gift that I brought to you , because God has dealt gr@@ aci@@ ously with me , and because I have enough . " he urged him , and he took it .
Jacob said to him , " My lord knows that the children are tender , and that the f@@ locks and herds with me have their young , and if they over@@ drive them one day , all the f@@ locks will die .
please let my lord pass over before his servant , and I will lead on gently , according to the pace of the livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children , until I come to my lord to Se@@ ir . "
Es@@ au said , " Let me now leave with you some of the folk who are with me . " he said , " Why ? let me find favor in the sight of my lord . "
Jacob came in peace to the city of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , when he came from P@@ add@@ an A@@ ram ; and enc@@ amped before the city .
he bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent , at the hand of the children of Ham@@ or , Sh@@ ec@@ hem 's father , for one hundred pieces of money .
his soul joined to Din@@ ah , the daughter of Jacob , and he loved the young lady , and spoke kindly to the young lady .
the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it . the men were griev@@ ed , and they were very angry , because he had done folly in Israel in lying with Jacob 's daughter ; a which thing ought not to be done .
ask me a great amount for a d@@ ow@@ ry , and I will give whatever you ask of me , but give me the young lady as a wife . "
and said to them , " We can '@@ t do this thing , to give our sister to one who is un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised ; for that is a repro@@ ach to us .
then will we give our daughters to you , and we will take your daughters to us , and we will dwell with you , and we will become one people .
but if you will not listen to us , to be circum@@ c@@ ised , then we will take our sister , and we will be gone . "
the young man did@@ n '@@ t wait to do this thing , because he had delight in Jacob 's daughter , and he was honored above all the house of his father .
" these men are peaceful with us . therefore let them live in the land and trade in it . for behold , the land is large enough for them . let us take their daughters to us for wives , and let us give them our daughters .
all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Ham@@ or , and to Sh@@ ec@@ hem his son ; and every male was circum@@ c@@ ised , all who went out of the gate of his city .
it happened on the third day , when they were sore , that two of Jacob 's sons , Sim@@ eon and Lev@@ i , Din@@ ah 's brothers , each took his sword , came upon the un@@ susp@@ ecting city , and killed all the males .
they killed Ham@@ or and Sh@@ ec@@ hem , his son , with the edge of the sword , and took Din@@ ah out of Sh@@ ec@@ hem 's house , and went away .
God said to Jacob , " A@@ rise , go up to Be@@ the@@ l , and live there . make there an altar to God , who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Es@@ au your brother . "
then Jacob said to his household , and to all who were with him , " P@@ ut away the foreign gods that are among you , puri@@ fy yourselves , change your garments .
let us arise , and go up to Be@@ the@@ l . I will make there an altar to God , who answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the way which I went . "
they traveled , and a terror of God was on the cities that were around them , and they did@@ n '@@ t pursue the sons of Jacob .
God said to him , " I am God Almighty . be fruitful and multiply . a nation and a company of nations will be from you , and kings will come out of your body .
the land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac , I will give it to you , and to your seed after you will I give the land . "
Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him , a pillar of stone . he poured out a drink offering on it , and poured oil on it .
when she was in hard labor , the mid@@ wife said to her , " Don '@@ t be afraid , for now you will have another son . "
Jacob set up a pillar on her grave . the same is the P@@ ill@@ ar of Rach@@ el 's grave to this day .
it happened , while Israel lived in that land , that Re@@ ub@@ en went and lay with Bil@@ ha@@ h , his father 's conc@@ ub@@ ine , and Israel heard of it . now the sons of Jacob were twelve .
Es@@ au took his wives from the daughters of Can@@ a@@ an : Ad@@ ah the daughter of El@@ on , the Hit@@ tite ; and O@@ hol@@ i@@ bam@@ ah the daughter of An@@ ah , the daughter of Zi@@ be@@ on , the Hi@@ v@@ ite ;
O@@ hol@@ i@@ bam@@ ah bore Je@@ ush , Jal@@ am , and Kor@@ ah . these are the sons of Es@@ au , who were born to him in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
Tim@@ na was conc@@ ub@@ ine to Eli@@ p@@ haz , Es@@ au 's son ; and she bore to Eli@@ p@@ haz A@@ mal@@ ek . these are the sons of Ad@@ ah , Es@@ au 's wife .
these are the sons of Re@@ u@@ el : N@@ ah@@ ath , Zer@@ ah , Sham@@ ma@@ h , and M@@ iz@@ z@@ ah . these were the sons of Bas@@ em@@ ath , Es@@ au 's wife .
these were the sons of O@@ hol@@ i@@ bam@@ ah , the daughter of An@@ ah , the daughter of Zi@@ be@@ on , Es@@ au 's wife : she bore to Es@@ au Je@@ ush , Jal@@ am , and Kor@@ ah .
these are the chiefs of the sons of Es@@ au : the sons of Eli@@ p@@ haz the fir@@ st@@ born of Es@@ au : chief Tem@@ an , chief Omar , chief Z@@ eph@@ o , chief Ken@@ az ,
chief Kor@@ ah , chief G@@ at@@ am , chief A@@ mal@@ ek : these are the chiefs who came of Eli@@ p@@ haz in the land of E@@ dom ; these are the sons of Ad@@ ah .
these are the sons of Re@@ u@@ el , Es@@ au 's son : chief N@@ ah@@ ath , chief Zer@@ ah , chief Sham@@ ma@@ h , chief M@@ iz@@ z@@ ah : these are the chiefs who came of Re@@ u@@ el in the land of E@@ dom ; these are the sons of Bas@@ em@@ ath , Es@@ au 's wife .
these are the sons of O@@ hol@@ i@@ bam@@ ah , Es@@ au 's wife : chief Je@@ ush , chief Jal@@ am , chief Kor@@ ah : these are the chiefs who came of O@@ hol@@ i@@ bam@@ ah the daughter of An@@ ah , Es@@ au 's wife .
these are the children of Zi@@ be@@ on : Ai@@ ah and An@@ ah . this is An@@ ah who found the hot springs in the wilderness , as he fed the don@@ keys of Zi@@ be@@ on his father .
chief D@@ ish@@ on , chief E@@ zer , and chief D@@ ish@@ an : these are the chiefs who came of the Hor@@ ites , according to their chiefs in the land of Se@@ ir .
these are the kings who re@@ igned in the land of E@@ dom , before any king re@@ igned over the children of Israel .
Hus@@ ham died , and had@@ ad , the son of Bed@@ ad , who struck Mi@@ dian in the field of Mo@@ ab , re@@ igned in his place . the name of his city was Av@@ ith .
Ba@@ al Han@@ an the son of Ach@@ b@@ or died , and Had@@ ar re@@ igned in his place . the name of his city was P@@ au . his wife 's name was Me@@ het@@ ab@@ el , the daughter of Mat@@ red , the daughter of Me@@ z@@ a@@ hab .
these are the names of the chiefs who came from Es@@ au , according to their families , after their places , and by their names : chief Tim@@ na , chief Al@@ v@@ ah , chief Je@@ the@@ th ,
chief Mag@@ di@@ el , and chief I@@ ram . these are the chiefs of E@@ dom , according to their hab@@ itations in the land of their possession . this is Es@@ au , the father of the E@@ dom@@ ites .
now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children , because he was the son of his old age , and he made him a coat of many colors .
for behold , we were binding she@@ aves in the field , and behold , my she@@ af arose and also stood upright ; and behold , your she@@ aves came around , and bowed down to my she@@ af . "
his brothers said to him , " Will you indeed reign over us ? or will you indeed have dom@@ inion over us ? " they hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words .
he dreamed yet another dream , and told it to his brothers , and said , " Be@@ hold , I have dreamed yet another dream : and behold , the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me . "
Israel said to Joseph , " are@@ n '@@ t your brothers feeding the flock in Sh@@ ec@@ hem ? come , and I will send you to them . " he said to him , " Here I am . "
he said to him , " Go now , see whether it is well with your brothers , and well with the flock ; and bring me word again . " so he sent him out of the valley of He@@ br@@ on , and he came to Sh@@ ec@@ hem .
a certain man found him , and behold , he was wandering in the field . the man asked him , " What are you looking for ? "
come now therefore , and let 's kill him , and cast him into one of the pits , and we will say , ' An evil animal has dev@@ oured him . ' we will see what will become of his dreams . "
Re@@ ub@@ en heard it , and delivered him out of their hand , and said , " Let 's not take his life . "
it happened , when Joseph came to his brothers , that they stripped Joseph of his coat , the coat of many colors that was on him ;
they sat down to eat bread , and they lifted up their eyes and looked , and saw a car@@ avan of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ elites was coming from Gil@@ e@@ ad , with their cam@@ els bearing spices and bal@@ m and my@@ rr@@ h , going to carry it down to Egypt .
come , and let 's sell him to the I@@ sh@@ ma@@ elites , and not let our hand be on him ; for he is our brother , our flesh . " his brothers listened to him .
Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites who were merchants passed by , and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit , and sold Joseph to the I@@ sh@@ ma@@ elites for twenty pieces of silver . they brought Joseph into Egypt .
he returned to his brothers , and said , " The child is no more ; and I , where will I go ? "
they took Joseph 's coat , and killed a male goat , and di@@ pped the coat in the blood .
they took the coat of many colors , and they brought it to their father , and said , " We have found this . examine it , now , whether it is your son 's coat or not . "
all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him , but he refused to be comfor@@ ted . he said , " For I will go down to She@@ ol to my son mourning . " his father we@@ pt for him .
the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites sold him into Egypt to Po@@ ti@@ p@@ har , an officer of Phar@@ aoh 's , the captain of the guard .
it happened at that time , that Jud@@ ah went down from his brothers , and visited a certain Ad@@ ul@@ lam@@ ite , whose name was Hir@@ ah .
Jud@@ ah said to On@@ an , " Go in to your brother 's wife , and perform the duty of a husband 's brother to her , and raise up seed to your brother . "
On@@ an knew that the seed w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t be his ; and it happened , when he went in to his brother 's wife , that he spilled it on the ground , lest he should give seed to his brother .
he said , " I will send you a young goat from the flock . " she said , " Will you give me a pledge , until you send it ? "
he said , " What pledge will I give you ? " she said , " Your sig@@ net and your cord , and your staff that is in your hand . " he gave them to her , and came in to her , and she conceived by him .
she arose , and went away , and put off her veil from her , and put on the garments of her wi@@ do@@ wh@@ ood .
then he asked the men of her place , saying , " Where is the pro@@ stitute , that was at En@@ aim by the road ? " they said , " There has been no pro@@ stitute here . "
he returned to Jud@@ ah , and said , " I haven '@@ t found her ; and also the men of the place said , ' There has been no pro@@ stitute here . ' "
it happened about three months later , that it was told Jud@@ ah , saying , " Tam@@ ar , your daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , has played the pro@@ stitute ; and moreover , behold , she is with child by prostitution . " Jud@@ ah said , " B@@ ring her out , and let her be burnt . "
Jud@@ ah acknowledged them , and said , " She is more righteous than I , because I did@@ n '@@ t give her to Shel@@ ah , my son . " he knew her again no more .
it happened in the time of her trav@@ ail , that behold , twins were in her womb .
when she tr@@ avail@@ ed , one put out a hand , and the mid@@ wife took and tied a scar@@ let thread on his hand , saying , " This came out first . "
it happened , as he drew back his hand , that behold , his brother came out , and she said , " Why have you made a breach for yourself ? " therefore his name was called Per@@ ez .
afterward his brother came out , that had the scar@@ let thread on his hand , and his name was called Zer@@ ah .
Joseph was brought down to Egypt . Po@@ ti@@ p@@ har , an officer of Phar@@ aoh 's , the captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him from the hand of the I@@ sh@@ ma@@ elites that had brought him down there .
she called to the men of her house , and spoke to them , saying , " Be@@ hold , he has brought in a Hebrew to us to mo@@ ck us . he came in to me to lie with me , and I cried with a loud voice .
she spoke to him according to these words , saying , " The Hebrew servant , whom you have brought to us , came in to me to mo@@ ck me ,
and it happened , as I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment by me , and ran outside . "
it happened , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she spoke to him , saying , " This is what your servant did to me , " that his wrath was kind@@ led .
Joseph 's master took him , and put him into the prison , the place where the king 's prisoners were bound , and he was there in custody .
the chief cu@@ p@@ be@@ arer told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , " In my dream , behold , a vine was in front of me ,
and in the vine were three branches . it was as though it bud@@ ded , it blos@@ som@@ ed , and its clusters produced ripe grapes .
Phar@@ aoh 's cup was in my hand ; and I took the grapes , and pressed them into Phar@@ aoh 's cup , and I gave the cup into Phar@@ aoh 's hand . "
but remember me when it will be well with you , and please show kindness to me , and make mention of me to Phar@@ aoh , and bring me out of this house .
for indeed , I was stolen away out of the land of the He@@ bre@@ ws , and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dun@@ geon . "
when the chief b@@ aker saw that the interpretation was good , he said to Joseph , " I also was in my dream , and behold , three bas@@ kets of white bread were on my head .
in the up@@ per@@ most basket there was all kinds of baked food for Phar@@ aoh , and the birds ate them out of the basket on my head . "
behold , seven heads of grain , thin and b@@ lasted with the east wind , sp@@ run@@ g up after them .
it happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled , and he sent and called for all of Egypt 's mag@@ icians and wise men . Phar@@ aoh told them his dreams , but there was no one who could interpret them to Phar@@ aoh .
we dreamed a dream in one night , I and he . we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream .
it happened , as he interpreted to us , so it was : he restored me to my office , and he han@@ ged him . "
then Phar@@ aoh sent and called Joseph , and they brought him hastily out of the dun@@ geon . he sha@@ ved himself , changed his clothing , and came in to Phar@@ aoh .
Phar@@ aoh said to Joseph , " I have dreamed a dream , and there is no one who can interpret it . I have heard it said of you , that when you hear a dream you can interpret it . "
and behold , there came up out of the river seven cattle , fat and sle@@ ek . they fed in the mar@@ sh grass ,
and behold , seven heads of grain , with@@ ered , thin , and b@@ lasted with the east wind , sp@@ run@@ g up after them .
Joseph said to Phar@@ aoh , " The dream of Phar@@ aoh is one . what God is about to do he has declared to Phar@@ aoh .
the seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are seven years , and also the seven empty heads of grain b@@ lasted with the east wind ; they will be seven years of famine .
that is the thing which I spoke to Phar@@ aoh . what God is about to do he has shown to Phar@@ aoh .
there will arise after them seven years of famine , and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt . the famine will consume the land ,
let them gather all the food of these good years that come , and lay up grain under the hand of Phar@@ aoh for food in the cities , and let them keep it .
the food will be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine , which will be in the land of Egypt ; that the land not perish through the famine . "
you shall be over my house , and according to your word will all my people be ruled . only in the throne I will be greater than you . "
Phar@@ aoh took off his sig@@ net ring from his hand , and put it on Joseph 's hand , and ar@@ ra@@ yed him in robes of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck ,
he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt , and laid up the food in the cities : the food of the field , which was around every city , he laid up in the same .
to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came , whom A@@ sen@@ ath , the daughter of Po@@ ti@@ ph@@ era priest of On , bore to him .
Joseph called the name of the fir@@ st@@ born Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , " For , " he said , " God has made me forget all my to@@ il , and all my father 's house . "
the seven years of famine began to come , just as Joseph had said . there was famine in all lands , but in all the land of Egypt there was bread .
the famine was over all the surface of the earth . Joseph opened all the store houses , and sold to the Egyptians . the famine was severe in the land of Egypt .
now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt , and Jacob said to his sons , " Why do you look at one another ? "
he said , " Be@@ hold , I have heard that there is grain in Egypt . go down there , and buy for us from there , so that we may live , and not die . "
Joseph was the governor over the land . it was he who sold to all the people of the land . Joseph 's brothers came , and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth .
Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them , and said to them , " You are spies ! you have come to see the n@@ ak@@ edness of the land . "
they said , " We , your servants , are twelve brothers , the sons of one man in the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; and behold , the youngest is this day with our father , and one is no more . "
send one of you , and let him get your brother , and you shall be bound , that your words may be tested , whether there is truth in you , or else by the life of Phar@@ aoh surely you are spies . "
they said one to another , " We are certainly guilty concerning our brother , in that we saw the distress of his soul , when he beg@@ ged us , and we w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen . therefore this distress has come upon us . "
Re@@ ub@@ en answered them , saying , " did@@ n '@@ t I tell you , saying , ' Don '@@ t sin against the child , ' and you w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t listen ? therefore also , behold , his blood is required . "
then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain , and to restore each man 's money into his sack , and to give them food for the way . so it was done to them .
as one of them opened his sack to give his don@@ key food in the lodging place , he saw his money . behold , it was in the mouth of his sack .
he said to his brothers , " My money is restored ! behold , it is in my sack ! " their hearts failed them , and they turned trembling one to another , saying , " What is this that God has done to us ? "
we are twelve brothers , sons of our father ; one is no more , and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Can@@ a@@ an . '
bring your youngest brother to me . then I will know that you are not spies , but that you are honest men . so I will deliver your brother to you , and you shall trade in the land . ' "
Jacob , their father , said to them , " You have ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed me of my children ! Joseph is no more , Sim@@ eon is no more , and you want to take Benjamin away . all these things are against me . "
it happened , when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt , their father said to them , " Go again , buy us a little more food . "
but if you 'll not send him , we 'll not go down , for the man said to us , ' You shall not see my face , unless your brother is with you . ' "
Jud@@ ah said to Israel , his father , " Send the boy with me , and we 'll get up and go , so that we may live , and not die , both we , and you , and also our little ones .
they came near to the ste@@ ward of Joseph 's house , and they spoke to him at the door of the house ,
when we came to the lodging place , we opened our s@@ acks , and behold , each man 's money was in the mouth of his sack , our money in full weight . we have brought it back in our hand .
he said , " Peace be to you . Don '@@ t be afraid . your God , and the God of your father , has given you treasure in your s@@ acks . I received your money . " he brought Sim@@ eon out to them .
he asked them of their welfare , and said , " Is your father well , the old man of whom you spoke ? is he yet alive ? "
they said , " Your servant , our father , is well . he is still alive . " they bowed down hum@@ bly .
he washed his face , and came out . he controlled himself , and said , " Ser@@ ve the meal . "
they served him by himself , and them by themselves , and the Egyptians , that ate with him , by themselves , because the Egyptians don '@@ t eat bread with the He@@ bre@@ ws , for that is an ab@@ om@@ ination to the Egyptians .
he commanded the ste@@ ward of his house , saying , " F@@ ill the men 's s@@ acks with food , as much as they can carry , and put each man 's money in his sack 's mouth .
when they had gone out of the city , and were not yet far off , Joseph said to his ste@@ ward , " Up , follow after the men . when you over@@ take them , ask them , ' Why have you rewarded evil for good ?
is@@ n '@@ t this that from which my lord drinks , and by which he indeed div@@ ines ? you have done evil in so doing . ' "
they said to him , " Why does my lord speak such words as these ? far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing !
behold , the money , which we found in our s@@ acks ' mouths , we brought again to you out of the land of Can@@ a@@ an . how then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord 's house ?
with wh@@ om@@ ever of your servants it is found , let him die , and we also will be my lord 's bond@@ servants . "
he searched , beginning with the el@@ dest , and ending at the youngest . the cup was found in Benjamin 's sack .
Joseph said to them , " What deed is this that you have done ? Don '@@ t you know that such a man as I can indeed divine ? "
Jud@@ ah said , " What will we tell my lord ? what will we speak ? or how will we clear ourselves ? God has found out the ini@@ qu@@ ity of your servants . behold , we are my lord 's bond@@ servants , both we , and he also in whose hand the cup is found . "
he said , " Far be it from me that I should do so . the man in whose hand the cup is found , he will be my bond@@ servant ; but as for you , go up in peace to your father . "
then Jud@@ ah came near to him , and said , " Oh , my lord , please let your servant speak a word in my lord 's ears , and don '@@ t let your anger burn against your servant ; for you are even as Phar@@ aoh .
we said to my lord , ' We have a father , an old man , and a child of his old age , a little one ; and his brother is dead , and he alone is left of his mother ; and his father loves him . '
you said to your servants , ' B@@ ring him down to me , that I may set my eyes on him . '
we said to my lord , ' The boy can '@@ t leave his father : for if he should leave his father , his father would die . '
we said , ' We can '@@ t go down . if our youngest brother is with us , then we will go down : for we may not see the man 's face , unless our youngest brother is with us . '
and the one went out from me , and I said , " Su@@ rely he is torn in pieces " ; and I haven '@@ t seen him since .
now therefore when I come to your servant my father , and the boy is not with us ; since his life is bound up in the boy 's life ;
it will happen , when he sees that the boy is no more , that he will die . your servants will bring down the gray ha@@ irs of your servant , our father , with sorrow to She@@ ol .
now therefore , please let your servant stay instead of the boy , a bond@@ servant to my lord ; and let the boy go up with his brothers .
then Joseph cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t control himself before all those who stood before him , and he cried , " C@@ ause everyone to go out from me ! " no one else stood with him , while Joseph made himself known to his brothers .
Joseph said to his brothers , " Come near to me , please . " they came near . " he said , I am Joseph , your brother , whom you sold into Egypt .
for these two years the famine has been in the land , and there are yet five years , in which there will be neither pl@@ owing nor harvest .
God sent me before you to preserve for you a remn@@ ant in the earth , and to save you alive by a great deliver@@ ance .
so now it was@@ n '@@ t you who sent me here , but God , and he has made me a father to Phar@@ aoh , lord of all his house , and ruler over all the land of Egypt .
hurry , and go up to my father , and tell him , ' This is what your son Joseph says , " God has made me lord of all Egypt . come down to me . Don '@@ t wait .
you shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt , and of all that you have seen . you shall hurry and bring my father down here . "
take your father and your households , and come to me , and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and you will eat the fat of the land . '
the sons of Israel did so . Joseph gave them w@@ agons , according to the commandment of Phar@@ aoh , and gave them provision for the way .
he gave each one of them changes of clothing , but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing .
he sent the following to his father : ten don@@ keys loaded with the good things of Egypt , and ten female don@@ keys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way .
they told him , saying , " Joseph is still alive , and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt . " his heart fain@@ ted , for he did@@ n '@@ t believe them .
he said , " I am God , the God of your father . Don '@@ t be afraid to go down into Egypt , for there I will make of you a great nation .
his sons , and his sons ' sons with him , his daughters , and his sons ' daughters , and he brought all his seed with him into Egypt .
these are the sons of Le@@ ah , whom she bore to Jacob in P@@ add@@ an A@@ ram , with his daughter Din@@ ah . all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty @@@ -@@ @ three .
these are the sons of Z@@ il@@ pa@@ h , whom Lab@@ an gave to Le@@ ah , his daughter , and these she bore to Jacob , even sixteen souls .
to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Man@@ as@@ se@@ h and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , whom A@@ sen@@ ath , the daughter of Po@@ ti@@ ph@@ era , priest of On , bore to him .
these are the sons of Rach@@ el , who were born to Jacob : all the souls were fourteen .
all the souls who came with Jacob into Egypt , who were his direct descendants , besides Jacob 's sons ' wives , all the souls were sixty @@@ -@@ @ six .
the sons of Joseph , who were born to him in Egypt , were two souls . all the souls of the house of Jacob , who came into Egypt , were seventy .
Joseph prepared his ch@@ ari@@ ot , and went up to meet Israel , his father , in Gos@@ hen . he presented himself to him , and fell on his neck , and we@@ pt on his neck a good while .
Israel said to Joseph , " Now let me die , since I have seen your face , that you are still alive . "
Joseph said to his brothers , and to his father 's house , " I will go up , and speak with Phar@@ aoh , and will tell him , ' My brothers , and my father 's house , who were in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , have come to me .
that you shall say , ' Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth even until now , both we , and our fathers : ' that you may dwell in the land of Gos@@ hen ; for every shepherd is an ab@@ om@@ ination to the Egyptians . "
Phar@@ aoh said to his brothers , " What is your occupation ? " they said to Phar@@ aoh , " Your servants are shep@@ herds , both we , and our fathers . "
they said to Phar@@ aoh , " We have come to live as foreigners in the land , for there is no past@@ ure for your servants ' f@@ locks . for the famine is severe in the land of Can@@ a@@ an . now therefore , please let your servants dwell in the land of Gos@@ hen . "
Joseph placed his father and his brothers , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Ram@@ eses , as Phar@@ aoh had commanded .
there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very severe , so that the land of Egypt and the land of Can@@ a@@ an fain@@ ted by reason of the famine .
Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , for the grain which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into Phar@@ aoh 's house .
when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , all the Egyptians came to Joseph , and said , " Gi@@ ve us bread , for why should we die in your presence ? for our money fails . "
so Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Phar@@ aoh , for every man of the Egyptians sold his field , because the famine was severe on them , and the land became Phar@@ aoh 's .
only he did@@ n '@@ t buy the land of the priests , for the priests had a portion from Phar@@ aoh , and ate their portion which Phar@@ aoh gave them . that is why they did@@ n '@@ t sell their land .
then Joseph said to the people , " Be@@ hold , I have bought you and your land today for Phar@@ aoh . behold , here is seed for you , and you shall sow the land .
they said , " You have saved our lives ! let us find favor in the sight of my lord , and we will be Phar@@ aoh 's servants . "
Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day , that Phar@@ aoh should have the fifth . only the land of the priests alone did@@ n '@@ t become Phar@@ aoh 's .
Israel lived in the land of Egypt , in the land of Gos@@ hen ; and they got themselves possessions therein , and were fruitful , and multiplied exceedingly .
Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years . so the days of Jacob , the years of his life , were one hundred forty @@@ -@@ @ seven years .
he said , " swear to me , " and he s@@ wore to him . Israel bowed himself on the bed 's head .
it happened after these things , that someone said to Joseph , " Be@@ hold , your father is sick . " he took with him his two sons , Man@@ as@@ se@@ h and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
someone told Jacob , and said , " Be@@ hold , your son Joseph comes to you , " and Israel strengthened himself , and sat on the bed .
and said to me , ' Be@@ hold , I will make you fruitful , and multiply you , and I will make of you a company of peoples , and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession . '
your issue , whom you become the father of after them , will be yours . they will be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance .
as for me , when I came from P@@ add@@ an , Rach@@ el died by me in the land of Can@@ a@@ an in the way , when there was still some distance to come to E@@ phr@@ ath , and I buried her there in the way to E@@ phr@@ ath ( the same is Bethlehem ) . "
Joseph said to his father , " They are my sons , whom God has given me here . " he said , " Please bring them to me , and I will bless them . "
now the eyes of Israel were dim for age , so that he cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t see . he brought them near to him ; and he kis@@ sed them , and embraced them .
Israel said to Joseph , " I did@@ n '@@ t think I would see your face , and behold , God has let me see your seed also . "
Joseph took them both , E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near to him .
Israel stretched out his right hand , and laid it on E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im 's head , who was the younger , and his left hand on Man@@ as@@ se@@ h 's head , guiding his hands knowingly , for Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was the fir@@ st@@ born .
the angel who has re@@ deemed me from all evil , bless the lad@@ s , and let my name be named on them , and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac . let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth . "
Israel said to Joseph , " Be@@ hold , I am dying , but God will be with you , and bring you again to the land of your fathers .
moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers , which I took out of the hand of the A@@ mor@@ ite with my sword and with my bow . "
Jacob called to his sons , and said : " gather yourselves together , that I may tell you that which will happen to you in the days to come .
" Re@@ ub@@ en , you are my fir@@ st@@ born , my might , and the beginning of my strength ; exc@@ elling in dignity , and exc@@ elling in power .
cur@@ sed be their anger , for it was fierce ; and their wrath , for it was cruel . I will divide them in Jacob , and sc@@ atter them in Israel .
" Jud@@ ah , your brothers will praise you . your hand will be on the neck of your enemies . your father 's sons will bow down before you .
Jud@@ ah is a lion 's cu@@ b . from the prey , my son , you have gone up . he sto@@ op@@ ed down , he c@@ rou@@ ched as a lion , as a lion@@ ess . who will r@@ ouse him up ?
he saw a resting place , that it was good , the land , that it was pleasant . he b@@ ows his shoulder to the burden , and becomes a servant doing forced labor .
even by the God of your father , who will help you ; by the Almighty , who will bless you , with blessings of heaven above , blessings of the deep that lies below , blessings of the breasts , and of the womb .
he instructed them , and said to them , " I am to be gathered to my people . bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of E@@ ph@@ ron the Hit@@ tite ,
in the cave that is in the field of Mach@@ pel@@ ah , which is before Mam@@ re , in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which Abraham bought with the field from E@@ ph@@ ron the Hit@@ tite as a burial place .
when Jacob made an end of charging his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the spirit , and was gathered to his people .
forty days were fulfilled for him , for that is how many the days it takes to em@@ bal@@ m . the Egyptians we@@ pt for him for seventy days .
when the days of we@@ eping for him were past , Joseph spoke to the house of Phar@@ aoh , saying , " If now I have found favor in your eyes , please speak in the ears of Phar@@ aoh , saying ,
Joseph went up to bury his father ; and with him went up all the servants of Phar@@ aoh , the elders of his house , all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
all the house of Joseph , his brothers , and his father 's house . only their little ones , their f@@ locks , and their herds , they left in the land of Gos@@ hen .
they came to the thresh@@ ing floor of At@@ ad , which is beyond the Jordan , and there they lam@@ ented with a very great and severe lam@@ entation . he mour@@ ned for his father seven days .
when the inhabitants of the land , the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , saw the mourning in the floor of At@@ ad , they said , " This is a griev@@ ous mourning by the Egyptians . " therefore its name was called A@@ bel M@@ iz@@ ra@@ im , which is beyond the Jordan .
for his sons carried him into the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and buried him in the cave of the field of Mach@@ pel@@ ah , which Abraham bought with the field , for a possession of a burial site , from E@@ ph@@ ron the Hit@@ tite , before Mam@@ re .
when Joseph 's brothers saw that their father was dead , they said , " It may be that Joseph will hate us , and will fully pay us back for all of the evil which we did to him . "
now therefore don '@@ t be afraid . I will nour@@ ish you and your little ones . " he comfor@@ ted them , and spoke kindly to them .
Joseph said to his brothers , " I am dying , but God will surely visit you , and bring you up out of this land to the land which he s@@ wore to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob . "
now these are the names of the sons of Israel , who came into Egypt ( every man and his household came with Jacob ) :
the children of Israel were fruitful , and increased ab@@ und@@ antly , and multiplied , and grew exceedingly mighty ; and the land was filled with them .
but the more they afflicted them , the more they multiplied and the more they spread out . they were griev@@ ed because of the children of Israel .
and they made their lives bitter with hard service , in mortar and in brick , and in all kinds of service in the field , all their service , in which they ruth@@ lessly made them serve .
the king of Egypt called for the mid@@ wives , and said to them , " Why have you done this thing , and have saved the boys alive ? "
the woman conceived , and bore a son . when she saw that he was a fine child , she hid him three months .
when she could no longer hide him , she took a pap@@ yr@@ us basket for him , and coated it with tar and with pitch . she put the child in it , and laid it in the re@@ eds by the river 's bank .
Phar@@ aoh 's daughter came down to ba@@ the at the river . her mai@@ dens walked along by the river@@ side . she saw the basket among the re@@ eds , and sent her hand@@ maid to get it .
then his sister said to Phar@@ aoh 's daughter , " Should I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women , that she may nurse the child for you ? "
he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no one , he killed the Egyptian , and hid him in the sand .
he said , " Who made you a prince and a judge over us ? do you plan to kill me , as you killed the Egyptian ? " Moses was afraid , and said , " Su@@ rely this thing is known . "
now when Phar@@ aoh heard this thing , he sought to kill Moses . but Moses fled from the face of Phar@@ aoh , and lived in the land of Mi@@ dian , and he sat down by a well .
he said to his daughters , " Where is he ? why is it that you have left the man ? call him , that he may eat bread . "
the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush . he looked , and behold , the bush burned with fire , and the bush was not consumed .
Moses said , " I will turn aside now , and see this great sight , why the bush is not burnt . "
when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h saw that he turned aside to see , God called to him out of the midst of the bush , and said , " Moses ! Moses ! " he said , " Here I am . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , " I have surely seen the afflic@@ tion of my people who are in Egypt , and have heard their cry because of their t@@ ask@@ masters , for I know their sor@@ rows .
now , behold , the cry of the children of Israel has come to me . moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians op@@ press them .
Moses said to God , " Be@@ hold , when I come to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' The God of your fathers has sent me to you ; ' and they ask me , ' What is his name ? ' what should I tell them ? "
go , and gather the elders of Israel together , and tell them , ' Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Jacob , has appeared to me , saying , " I have surely visited you , and seen that which is done to you in Egypt ;
I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in its midst , and after that he will let you go .
but every woman shall ask of her neighbor , and of her who visits her house , jew@@ els of silver , jew@@ els of gold , and clothing ; and you shall put them on your sons , and on your daughters . you shall pl@@ under the Egyptians . "
Moses answered , " But , behold , they will not believe me , nor listen to my voice ; for they will say , ' Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has not appeared to you . ' "
he said , " Th@@ row it on the ground . " he threw it on the ground , and it became a snake ; and Moses ran away from it .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " St@@ ret@@ ch out your hand , and take it by the tail . " he stretched out his hand , and took hold of it , and it became a rod in his hand .
" that they may believe that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , has appeared to you . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to him , " Who made man 's mouth ? or who makes one mute , or deaf , or seeing , or blind ? is@@ n '@@ t it I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ?
he will be your spokesman to the people ; and it will happen , that he will be to you a mouth , and you will be to him as God .
Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them on a don@@ key , and he returned to the land of Egypt . Moses took God 's rod in his hand .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " When you go back into Egypt , see that you do before Phar@@ aoh all the wonders which I have put in your hand , but I will har@@ den his heart and he will not let the people go .
and I have said to you , " Let my son go , that he may serve me " ; and you have refused to let him go . behold , I will kill your son , your fir@@ st@@ born . ' "
it happened on the way at a lodging place , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h met Moses and wanted to kill him .
then Zi@@ p@@ por@@ ah took a fl@@ int , and cut off the fores@@ kin of her son , and cast it at his feet ; and she said , " Su@@ rely you are a bri@@ deg@@ room of blood to me . "
so he let him alone . then she said , " You are a bri@@ deg@@ room of blood , " because of the circum@@ cision .
Moses told Aaron all the words of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h with which he had sent him , and all the signs with which he had instructed him .
the people believed , and when they heard that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had visited the children of Israel , and that he had seen their afflic@@ tion , then they bowed their heads and worshi@@ ped .
afterward Moses and Aaron came , and said to Phar@@ aoh , " This is what Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , says , ' Let my people go , that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness . ' "
Phar@@ aoh said , " Who is Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that I should listen to his voice to let Israel go ? I don '@@ t know Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and moreover I will not let Israel go . "
they said , " The God of the He@@ bre@@ ws has met with us . please let us go three days ' journey into the wilderness , and sacrifice to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , our God , lest he fall on us with pesti@@ l@@ ence , or with the sword . "
the king of Egypt said to them , " Why do you , Moses and Aaron , take the people from their work ? get back to your burdens ! "
the officers of the children of Israel , whom Phar@@ aoh 's t@@ ask@@ masters had set over them , were beaten , and demanded , " Why haven '@@ t you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today , in making brick as before ? "
then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Phar@@ aoh , saying , " Why do you deal this way with your servants ?
no straw is given to your servants , and they tell us , ' Make brick ! ' and behold , your servants are beaten ; but the fault is in your own people . "
but he said , " You are idle ! you are idle ! therefore you say , ' Let us go and sacrifice to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . '
and they said to them , " May Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h look at you , and judge , because you have made us a sten@@ ch to be ab@@ hor@@ red in the eyes of Phar@@ aoh , and in the eyes of his servants , to put a sword in their hand to kill us . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " Now you shall see what I will do to Phar@@ aoh , for by a strong hand he shall let them go , and by a strong hand he shall drive them out of his land . "
I have also established my covenant with them , to give them the land of Can@@ a@@ an , the land of their travels , in which they lived as aliens .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God ; and you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
" go in , speak to Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt , that he let the children of Israel go out of his land . "
Moses spoke before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , saying , " Be@@ hold , the children of Israel haven '@@ t listened to me . how then shall Phar@@ aoh listen to me , who am of un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised lips ? "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke to Moses and to Aaron , and gave them a command to the children of Israel , and to Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
the sons of Sim@@ eon : J@@ em@@ u@@ el , and J@@ amin , and O@@ had , and J@@ ach@@ in , and Zo@@ har , and Sha@@ ul the son of a Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite woman ; these are the families of Sim@@ eon .
the sons of Ko@@ hath : Am@@ ram , and Iz@@ har , and He@@ br@@ on , and Uz@@ zi@@ el ; and the years of the life of Ko@@ hath were one hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ three years .
the sons of Mer@@ ari : Mah@@ li and Mus@@ hi . these are the families of the Lev@@ ites according to their generations .
Am@@ ram took Jo@@ che@@ bed his father 's sister to himself as wife ; and she bore him Aaron and Moses : and the years of the life of Am@@ ram were a hundred and thirty @@@ -@@ @ seven years .
Ele@@ az@@ ar Aaron 's son took one of the daughters of P@@ uti@@ el as his wife ; and she bore him Ph@@ ine@@ has . these are the heads of the fathers ' houses of the Lev@@ ites according to their families .
these are that Aaron and Moses , to whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , " B@@ ring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies . "
these are those who spoke to Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt . these are that Moses and Aaron .
Moses said before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " Be@@ hold , I am of un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised lips , and how shall Phar@@ aoh listen to me ? "
but Phar@@ aoh will not listen to you , and I will lay my hand on Egypt , and bring out my armies , my people the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt by great judgments .
the Egyptians shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , when I stretch out my hand on Egypt , and bring out the children of Israel from among them . "
go to Phar@@ aoh in the morning . behold , he goes out to the water ; and you shall stand by the river 's bank to meet him ; and the rod which was turned to a ser@@ pent you shall take in your hand .
you shall tell him , ' Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of the He@@ bre@@ ws , has sent me to you , saying , " Let my people go , that they may serve me in the wilderness : " and behold , until now you haven '@@ t listened .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " In this you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . behold , I will strike with the rod that is in my hand on the waters which are in the river , and they shall be turned to blood .
Moses and Aaron did so , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h commanded ; and he lifted up the rod , and struck the waters that were in the river , in the sight of Phar@@ aoh , and in the sight of his servants ; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood .
the fish that were in the river died ; and the river became foul , and the Egyptians cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t drink water from the river ; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt .
the mag@@ icians of Egypt did the same thing with their enchan@@ tments ; and Phar@@ aoh 's heart was hardened , and he did@@ n '@@ t listen to them ; as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had spoken .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke to Moses , Go in to Phar@@ aoh , and tell him , " This is what Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h says , ' Let my people go , that they may serve me .
and the fro@@ gs shall come up both on you , and on your people , and on all your servants . ' "
Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt ; and the fro@@ gs came up , and covered the land of Egypt .
then Phar@@ aoh called for Moses and Aaron , and said , " entre@@ at Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that he take away the fro@@ gs from me , and from my people ; and I will let the people go , that they may sacrifice to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " Tell Aaron , ' St@@ ret@@ ch out your rod , and strike the dust of the earth , that it may become l@@ ice throughout all the land of Egypt . ' "
they did so ; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod , and struck the dust of the earth , and there were l@@ ice on man , and on animal ; all the dust of the earth became l@@ ice throughout all the land of Egypt .
then the mag@@ icians said to Phar@@ aoh , " This is the finger of God : " and Phar@@ aoh 's heart was hardened , and he did@@ n '@@ t listen to them ; as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had spoken .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " R@@ ise up early in the morning , and stand before Phar@@ aoh ; behold , he comes out to the water ; and tell him , ' This is what Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h says , " Let my people go , that they may serve me .
I will set apart in that day the land of Gos@@ hen , in which my people dwell , that no s@@ war@@ ms of flies shall be there ; to the end you may know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in the midst of the earth .
I will put a division between my people and your people : by tomorrow shall this sign be . " ' "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h did so ; and there came griev@@ ous s@@ war@@ ms of flies into the house of Phar@@ aoh , and into his servants ' houses : and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the s@@ war@@ ms of flies .
Phar@@ aoh said , " I will let you go , that you may sacrifice to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God in the wilderness , only you shall not go very far away . pray for me . "
Moses said , " Be@@ hold , I go out from you , and I will pray to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h that the s@@ war@@ ms of flies may depart from Phar@@ aoh , from his servants , and from his people , tomorrow ; only don '@@ t let Phar@@ aoh deal dece@@ it@@ fully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h did according to the word of Moses , and he removed the s@@ war@@ ms of flies from Phar@@ aoh , from his servants , and from his people . there remained not one .
then Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " Go in to Phar@@ aoh , and tell him , ' This is what Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of the He@@ bre@@ ws , says : " let my people go , that they may serve me .
behold , the hand of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is on your livestock which are in the field , on the horses , on the don@@ keys , on the cam@@ els , on the herds , and on the f@@ locks with a very griev@@ ous pesti@@ l@@ ence .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h did that thing on the next day ; and all the livestock of Egypt died , but of the livestock of the children of Israel , not one died .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses and to Aaron , " Take to you hand@@ ful@@ s of ashes of the furnace , and let Moses sprink@@ le it toward the sky in the sight of Phar@@ aoh .
it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt , and shall be a boil breaking out with bo@@ ils on man and on animal , throughout all the land of Egypt . "
they took ashes of the furnace , and stood before Phar@@ aoh ; and Moses sprink@@ led it up toward the sky ; and it became a boil breaking out with bo@@ ils on man and on animal .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " R@@ ise up early in the morning , and stand before Phar@@ aoh , and tell him , ' This is what Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of the He@@ bre@@ ws , says : " let my people go , that they may serve me .
for now I would have stretched out my hand , and struck you and your people with pesti@@ l@@ ence , and you would have been cut off from the earth ;
behold , tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very griev@@ ous hail , such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " St@@ ret@@ ch out your hand toward the sky , that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt , on man , and on animal , and on every her@@ b of the field , throughout the land of Egypt . "
so there was very severe hail , and lightning mixed with the hail , such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
the hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and animal ; and the hail struck every her@@ b of the field , and broke every tree of the field .
Moses said to him , " As soon as I have gone out of the city , I will spread abroad my hands to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . the th@@ un@@ ders shall cease , neither shall there be any more hail ; that you may know that the earth is Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's .
Moses went out of the city from Phar@@ aoh , and spread abroad his hands to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and the th@@ un@@ ders and hail ceased , and the rain was not poured on the earth .
the heart of Phar@@ aoh was hardened , and he did@@ n '@@ t let the children of Israel go , just as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had spoken through Moses .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " Go in to Phar@@ aoh , for I have hardened his heart , and the heart of his servants , that I may show these my signs in their midst ,
and that you may tell in the hearing of your son , and of your son 's son , what things I have done to Egypt , and my signs which I have done among them ; that you may know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
Moses said , " We will go with our young and with our old ; with our sons and with our daughters , with our f@@ locks and with our herds will we go ; for we must hold a feast to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
not so ! go now you who are men , and serve Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; for that is what you desire ! " they were driven out from Phar@@ aoh 's presence .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " St@@ ret@@ ch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the lo@@ cu@@ sts , that they may come up on the land of Egypt , and eat every her@@ b of the land , even all that the hail has left . "
Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h brought an east wind on the land all that day , and all the night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the lo@@ cu@@ sts .
the lo@@ cu@@ sts went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the borders of Egypt . they were very griev@@ ous . before them there were no such lo@@ cu@@ sts as they , neither after them shall be such .
then Phar@@ aoh called for Moses and Aaron in ha@@ ste , and he said , " I have sin@@ ned against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and against you .
now therefore please forgive my sin again , and pray to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , that he may also take away from me this death . "
but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h hardened Phar@@ aoh 's heart , and he did@@ n '@@ t let the children of Israel go .
Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky , and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days .
Moses said , " You must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings , that we may sacrifice to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians . moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt , in the sight of Phar@@ aoh 's servants , and in the sight of the people .
and all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt shall die , from the fir@@ st@@ born of Phar@@ aoh who sits on his throne , even to the fir@@ st@@ born of the female servant who is behind the mill ; and all the fir@@ st@@ born of livestock .
there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt , such as there has not been , nor shall be any more .
but against any of the children of Israel a dog won '@@ t even bark or move its tongue , against man or animal ; that you may know that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel .
all these your servants shall come down to me , and bow down themselves to me , saying , " Get out , with all the people who follow you " ; and after that I will go out . ' " he went out from Phar@@ aoh in hot anger .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " Phar@@ aoh won '@@ t listen to you , that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt . "
Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Phar@@ aoh , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h hardened Phar@@ aoh 's heart , and he did@@ n '@@ t let the children of Israel go out of his land .
and you shall keep it until the four@@ teenth day of the same month ; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at evening .
they shall take some of the blood , and put it on the two door@@ posts and on the lin@@ tel , on the houses in which they shall eat it .
Don '@@ t eat it raw , nor boiled at all with water , but ro@@ asted with fire ; with its head , its legs and its inner parts .
this is how you shall eat it : with your belt on your waist , your shoes on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and you shall eat it in ha@@ ste : it is Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's Pas@@ sover .
for I will go through the land of Egypt in that night , and will strike all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt , both man and animal . against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments : I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
the blood shall be to you for a token on the houses where you are : and when I see the blood , I will pass over you , and there shall no plague be on you to destroy you , when I strike the land of Egypt .
this day shall be to you for a memorial , and you shall keep it a feast to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : throughout your generations you shall keep it a feast by an ordin@@ ance forever .
" ' seven days you shall eat un@@ leav@@ ened bread ; even the first day you shall put away yeast out of your houses , for whoever eats leav@@ ened bread from the first day until the seventh day , that soul shall be cut off from Israel .
in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation , and in the seventh day a holy convocation ; no kind of work shall be done in them , except that which every man must eat , that only may be done by you .
you shall observe the feast of un@@ leav@@ ened bread ; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt : therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordin@@ ance forever .
there shall be no yeast found in your houses for seven days , for whoever eats that which is leav@@ ened , that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel , whether he be a foreigner , or one who is born in the land .
then Moses called for all the elders of Israel , and said to them , " D@@ raw out , and take lam@@ bs according to your families , and kill the Pas@@ sover .
for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will pass through to strike the Egyptians ; and when he sees the blood on the lin@@ tel , and on the two door@@ posts , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will pass over the door , and will not allow the destro@@ yer to come in to your houses to strike you .
it happened at midnight , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h struck all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt , from the fir@@ st@@ born of Phar@@ aoh who sat on his throne to the fir@@ st@@ born of the captive who was in the dun@@ geon ; and all the fir@@ st@@ born of livestock .
Phar@@ aoh rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyptians ; and there was a great cry in Egypt , for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
the Egyptians were urgent with the people , to send them out of the land in ha@@ ste , for they said , " We are all dead men . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians , so that they let them have what they asked . they despo@@ iled the Egyptians .
the children of Israel traveled from Ram@@ eses to S@@ uc@@ co@@ th , about six hundred thousand on foot who were men , besides children .
Moses said to the people , " Rem@@ ember this day , in which you came out from Egypt , out of the house of bond@@ age ; for by strength of hand Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h brought you out from this place . no leav@@ ened bread shall be eaten .
seven days you shall eat un@@ leav@@ ened bread , and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
it shall be for a sign to you on your hand , and for a memorial between your eyes , that the law of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h may be in your mouth ; for with a strong hand Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has brought you out of Egypt .
" it shall be , when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall bring you into the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , as he s@@ wore to you and to your fathers , and shall give it you ,
that you shall set apart to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h all that opens the womb , and every fir@@ st@@ born which you have that comes from an animal . the males shall be Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's .
every fir@@ st@@ born of a don@@ key you shall re@@ deem with a lamb ; and if you will not re@@ deem it , then you shall break its neck ; and you shall re@@ deem all the fir@@ st@@ born of man among your sons .
it shall be for a sign on your hand , and for symbols between your eyes : for by strength of hand Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h brought us out of Egypt . "
it happened , when Phar@@ aoh had let the people go , that God did@@ n '@@ t lead them by the way of the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , although that was near ; for God said , " L@@ est perhaps the people change their minds when they see war , and they return to Egypt " ;
Moses took the bones of Joseph with him , for he had made the children of Israel swear , saying , " God will surely visit you , and you shall carry up my bones away from here with you . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h went before them by day in a pillar of cloud , to lead them on their way , and by night in a pillar of fire , to give them light , that they might go by day and by night :
I will har@@ den Phar@@ aoh 's heart , and he will follow after them ; and I will get honor over Phar@@ aoh , and over all his armies ; and the Egyptians shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . " they did so .
it was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled ; and the heart of Phar@@ aoh and of his servants was changed towards the people , and they said , " What is this we have done , that we have let Israel go from serving us ? "
and he took six hundred chosen ch@@ ari@@ ots , and all the ch@@ ari@@ ots of Egypt , and cap@@ tains over all of them .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h hardened the heart of Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt , and he pursued after the children of Israel ; for the children of Israel went out with a high hand .
they said to Moses , " Because there were no graves in Egypt , have you taken us away to die in the wilderness ? why have you treated us this way , to bring us out of Egypt ?
Moses said to the people , " Don '@@ t be afraid . stand still , and see the salvation of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he will work for you today : for the Egyptians whom you have seen today , you shall never see them again .
lift up your rod , and stretch out your hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground .
I , behold , I will har@@ den the hearts of the Egyptians , and they shall go in after them : and I will get myself honor over Phar@@ aoh , and over all his armies , over his ch@@ ari@@ ots , and over his hor@@ sem@@ en .
the angel of God , who went before the camp of Israel , moved and went behind them ; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them , and stood behind them .
it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel ; and there was the cloud and the darkness , yet gave it light by night : and the one did@@ n '@@ t come near the other all the night .
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night , and made the sea dry land , and the waters were divided .
the Egyptians pursued , and went in after them into the midst of the sea : all of Phar@@ aoh 's horses , his ch@@ ari@@ ots , and his hor@@ sem@@ en .
it happened in the morning watch , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h looked out on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of cloud , and confused the Egyptian army .
he took off their ch@@ ari@@ ot wheels , and they drove them heavily ; so that the Egyptians said , " Let 's flee from the face of Israel , for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h fights for them against the Egyptians ! "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " St@@ ret@@ ch out your hand over the sea , that the waters may come again on the Egyptians , on their ch@@ ari@@ ots , and on their hor@@ sem@@ en . "
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyptians fled against it . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h over@@ threw the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
the waters returned , and covered the ch@@ ari@@ ots and the hor@@ sem@@ en , even all Phar@@ aoh 's army that went in after them into the sea . there remained not so much as one of them .
Y@@ ah is my strength and song . he has become my salvation . this is my God , and I will praise him ; my father 's God , and I will ex@@ alt him .
your right hand , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , is glorious in power . your right hand , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , d@@ ashes the enemy in pieces .
in the greatness of your excell@@ ency , you overthrow those who rise up against you . you send forth your wrath . it consumes them as stub@@ ble .
" you , in your loving kindness , have led the people that you have re@@ deemed . you have guided them in your strength to your holy hab@@ itation .
you shall bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance , the place , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which you have made for yourself to dwell in ; the sanctuary , Lord , which your hands have established .
for the horses of Phar@@ aoh went in with his ch@@ ari@@ ots and with his hor@@ sem@@ en into the sea , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h brought back the waters of the sea on them ; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea .
Mi@@ ri@@ am the proph@@ et@@ ess , the sister of Aaron , took a t@@ amb@@ our@@ ine in her hand ; and all the women went out after her with t@@ amb@@ our@@ ines and with dances .
Mi@@ ri@@ am answered them , " S@@ ing to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , for he has triumph@@ ed glori@@ ously . the horse and his ri@@ der he has thrown into the sea . "
Moses led Israel on@@ ward from the Red Sea , and they went out into the wilderness of Sh@@ ur ; and they went three days in the wilderness , and found no water .
then he cried to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h showed him a tree , and he threw it into the waters , and the waters were made sweet . there he made a statute and an ordin@@ ance for them , and there he tested them ;
they took their journey from Eli@@ m , and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of S@@ in , which is between Eli@@ m and Sinai , on the fif@@ teenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt .
it shall come to pass on the sixth day , that they shall prepare that which they bring in , and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily . "
Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel , " At evening , then you shall know that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has brought you out from the land of Egypt ;
and in the morning , then you shall see the glory of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; because he hears your mur@@ mur@@ ings against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . who are we , that you mur@@ mur against us ? "
Moses said to Aaron , " Tell all the congregation of the children of Israel , ' Come near before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , for he has heard your mur@@ mur@@ ings . ' "
it happened , as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel , that they looked toward the wilderness , and behold , the glory of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h appeared in the cloud .
when the de@@ w that lay had gone , behold , on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing , small as the frost on the ground .
when the children of Israel saw it , they said one to another , " What is it ? " for they did@@ n '@@ t know what it was . Moses said to them , " It is the bread which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has given you to eat . "
it happened that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread , two om@@ ers for each one , and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses .
they laid it up until the morning , as Moses asked , and it did@@ n '@@ t become foul , neither was there any worm in it .
Moses said , " E@@ at that today , for today is a Sabbath to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . today you shall not find it in the field .
behold , because Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has given you the Sabbath , therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days . everyone stay in his place . let no one go out of his place on the seventh day . "
Moses said to Aaron , " Take a pot , and put an O@@ mer @@@ -@@ @ full of man@@ na in it , and lay it up before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to be kept throughout your generations . "
the children of Israel ate the man@@ na forty years , until they came to an inhabited land . they ate the man@@ na until they came to the borders of the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
all the congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of S@@ in , by their journeys , according to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's commandment , and enc@@ amped in Rep@@ hi@@ dim ; but there was no water for the people to drink .
therefore the people quar@@ rel@@ ed with Moses , and said , " Gi@@ ve us water to drink . " Moses said to them , " Why do you quarrel with me ? why do you test Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ? "
the people were thir@@ sty for water there ; and the people mur@@ mu@@ red against Moses , and said , " Why have you brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us , our children , and our livestock with thirst ? "
behold , I will stand before you there on the rock in H@@ ore@@ b . you shall strike the rock , and water will come out of it , that the people may drink . " Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel .
Moses said to Joshua , " Choose men for us , and go out , fight with A@@ mal@@ ek . tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with God 's rod in my hand . "
it happened , when Moses held up his hand , that Israel prevailed ; and when he let down his hand , A@@ mal@@ ek prevailed .
now Je@@ thr@@ o , the priest of Mi@@ dian , Moses ' father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , heard of all that God had done for Moses , and for Israel his people , how that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had brought Israel out of Egypt .
Je@@ thr@@ o , Moses ' father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , received Zi@@ p@@ por@@ ah , Moses ' wife , after he had sent her away ,
and her two sons . the name of one son was Ger@@ sh@@ om , for Moses said , " I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land . "
the name of the other was Eli@@ ez@@ er , for he said , " My father 's God was my help and delivered me from Phar@@ aoh 's sword . "
Je@@ thr@@ o , Moses ' father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was enc@@ amped , at the Mountain of God .
he said to Moses , " I , your father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law Je@@ thr@@ o , have come to you with your wife , and her two sons with her . "
Moses went out to meet his father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , and bowed and kis@@ sed him . they asked each other of their welfare , and they came into the tent .
Moses told his father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law all that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had done to Phar@@ aoh and to the Egyptians for Israel 's sake , all the hardships that had come on them on the way , and how Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h delivered them .
Je@@ thr@@ o rejo@@ iced for all the goodness which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had done to Israel , in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians .
Je@@ thr@@ o said , " Bless@@ ed be Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of Phar@@ aoh ; who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians .
when Moses ' father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law saw all that he did to the people , he said , " What is this thing that you do for the people ? why do you sit alone , and all the people stand around you from morning to evening ? "
Moses said to his father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , " Because the people come to me to inqu@@ ire of God .
when they have a matter , they come to me , and I judge between a man and his neighbor , and I make them know the statutes of God , and his laws . "
you will surely wear away , both you , and this people that is with you ; for the thing is too heavy for you . you are not able to perform it yourself alone .
let them judge the people at all times . it shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you , but every small matter they shall judge themselves . so shall it be easier for you , and they shall share the load with you .
if you will do this thing , and God commands you so , then you will be able to endure , and all of these people also will go to their place in peace . "
in the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt , on that same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai .
Moses went up to God , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h called to him out of the mountain , saying , " This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel :
now therefore , if you will indeed obey my voice , and keep my covenant , then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples ; for all the earth is mine ;
all the people answered together , and said , " All that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken we will do . " Moses reported the words of the people to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " Be@@ hold , I come to you in a thick cloud , that the people may hear when I speak with you , and may also believe you forever . " Moses told the words of the people to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
and be ready against the third day ; for on the third day Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai .
you shall set bounds to the people all around , saying , ' Be careful that you don '@@ t go up onto the mountain , or touch its border . whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death .
it happened on the third day , when it was morning , that there were th@@ un@@ ders and light@@ nings , and a thick cloud on the mountain , and the sound of an exceedingly loud trum@@ pet ; and all the people who were in the camp trem@@ bled .
Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God ; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came down on Mount Sinai , to the top of the mountain . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h called Moses to the top of the mountain , and Moses went up .
Moses said to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " The people can '@@ t come up to Mount Sinai , for you warned us , saying , ' Set bounds around the mountain , and sancti@@ fy it . ' "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to him , " Go down and you shall bring Aaron up with you , but don '@@ t let the priests and the people break through to come up to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , lest he break forth on them . "
" I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bond@@ age .
for in six days Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that is in them , and rested the seventh day ; therefore Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h blessed the Sabbath day , and made it holy .
" you shall not co@@ vet your neighbor 's house . you shall not co@@ vet your neighbor 's wife , nor his male servant , nor his female servant , nor his ox , nor his don@@ key , nor anything that is your neighbor 's . "
all the people perceived the thunder@@ ings , the light@@ nings , the sound of the trum@@ pet , and the mountain smoking . when the people saw it , they trem@@ bled , and stayed at a distance .
" if you buy a Hebrew servant , he shall serve six years and in the seventh he shall go out free without paying anything .
but if the servant shall plainly say , ' I love my master , my wife , and my children . I will not go out free ; '
then his master shall bring him to God , and shall bring him to the door or to the door@@ post , and his master shall bore his ear through with an aw@@ l , and he shall serve him for ever .
" if a man sells his daughter to be a female servant , she shall not go out as the male servants do .
if a man schemes and comes presu@@ mp@@ tu@@ ously on his neighbor to kill him , you shall take him from my altar , that he may die .
" if men quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone , or with his fist , and he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t die , but is confined to bed ;
" if a man strikes his servant 's eye , or his maid 's eye , and destroys it , he shall let him go free for his eye 's sake .
if the bull Go@@ res a male servant or a female servant , thirty she@@ k@@ els of silver shall be given to their master , and the ox shall be st@@ oned .
" if a man opens a pit , or if a man di@@ gs a pit and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t cover it , and a bull or a don@@ key falls into it ,
" if one man 's bull inj@@ ures another 's , so that it dies , then they shall sell the live bull , and divide its price ; and they shall also divide the dead animal .
or if it is known that the bull was in the habit of G@@ OR@@ ING in the past , and its owner has not kept it in , he shall surely pay bull for bull , and the dead animal shall be his own .
if the thief is found breaking in , and is struck so that he dies , there shall be no guilt of bloodshed for him .
" if a man delivers to his neighbor money or stuff to keep , and it is stolen out of the man 's house ; if the thief is found , he shall pay double .
if the thief is@@ n '@@ t found , then the master of the house shall come near to God , to find out if he h@@ as@@ n '@@ t put his hand to his neighbor 's goods .
" you shall not wrong an alien , neither shall you op@@ press him , for you were aliens in the land of Egypt .
and my wrath will grow hot , and I will kill you with the sword ; and your wives shall be wid@@ ows , and your children fa@@ ther@@ less .
for that is his only covering , it is his garment for his skin . what would he sleep in ? it will happen , when he cries to me , that I will hear , for I am gr@@ acious .
" you shall not delay to offer from your harvest and from the outflow of your presses . " you shall give the fir@@ st@@ born of your sons to me .
you shall do likewise with your cattle and with your sheep . seven days it shall be with its mother , then on the eighth day you shall give it to me .
" you shall be holy men to me , therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by animals in the field . you shall cast it to the dogs .
" you shall not follow a crowd to do evil ; neither shall you testify in court to side with a multitude to perver@@ t justice ;
" if you meet your enemy 's ox or his don@@ key going astr@@ ay , you shall surely bring it back to him again .
if you see the don@@ key of him who h@@ ates you fallen down under his burden , don '@@ t leave him , you shall surely help him with it .
but the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie f@@ allow , that the poor of your people may eat ; and what they leave the animal of the field shall eat . in the same way , you shall deal with your viney@@ ard and with your olive gro@@ ve .
" be careful to do all things that I have said to you ; and don '@@ t invoke the name of other gods , neither let them be heard out of your mouth .
and the feast of harvest , the first fruits of your lab@@ ors , which you sow in the field : and the feast of harvest , at the end of the year , when you gather in your lab@@ ors out of the field .
" you shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leav@@ ened bread , neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning .
" behold , I send an angel before you , to keep you by the way , and to bring you into the place which I have prepared .
but if you indeed listen to his voice , and do all that I speak , then I will be an enemy to your enemies , and an adversary to your adversaries .
for my angel shall go before you , and bring you in to the A@@ mor@@ ite , the Hit@@ tite , the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , the Hi@@ v@@ ite , and the Je@@ bus@@ ite ; and I will cut them off .
you shall serve Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and he will bless your bread and your water , and I will take sickness away from your midst .
I will not drive them out from before you in one year , lest the land become des@@ ol@@ ate , and the animals of the field multiply against you .
he said to Moses , " Come up to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , you , and Aaron , Nad@@ ab , and A@@ bi@@ hu , and seventy of the elders of Israel ; and worship from a distance .
Moses came and told the people all the words of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and all the ordin@@ ances ; and all the people answered with one voice , and said , " All the words which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken will we do . "
Moses wrote all the words of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and rose up early in the morning , and built an altar under the mountain , and twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel .
he took the book of the covenant and read it in the hearing of the people , and they said , " All that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken will we do , and be obedient . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " Come up to me on the mountain , and stay here , and I will give you the tables of stone with the law and the commands that I have written , that you may teach them . "
he said to the elders , " W@@ ait here for us , until we come again to you . behold , Aaron and H@@ ur are with you . whoever is involved in a dispute can go to them . "
the glory of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h settled on Mount Sinai , and the cloud covered it six days . the seventh day he called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud .
Moses entered into the midst of the cloud , and went up on the mountain ; and Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights .

Aaron said to them , " Take off the golden rings , which are in the ears of your wives , of your sons , and of your daughters , and bring them to me . "
all the people took off the golden rings which were in their ears , and brought them to Aaron .
he received what they handed him , and fashioned it with an engra@@ ving tool , and made it a mol@@ ten cal@@ f ; and they said , " These are your gods , Israel , which brought you up out of the land of Egypt . "
they rose up early on the next day , and offered burnt offerings , and brought peace offerings ; and the people sat down to eat and to drink , and rose up to play .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke to Moses , " Go , get down ; for your people , who you brought up out of the land of Egypt , have corrupted themselves !
now therefore leave me alone , that my wrath may burn hot against them , and that I may consume them ; and I will make of you a great nation . "
Moses turned , and went down from the mountain , with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand ; tablets that were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other they were written .
the tablets were the work of God , and the writing was the writing of God , engra@@ ved on the tables .
he took the cal@@ f which they had made , and burnt it with fire , ground it to powder , and scattered it on the water , and made the children of Israel drink of it .
Aaron said , " Don '@@ t let the anger of my lord grow hot . you know the people , that they are set on evil .
for they said to me , ' Make us gods , which shall go before us ; for as for this Moses , the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we don '@@ t know what has become of him . '
I said to them , ' Who@@ ever has any gold , let them take it off : ' so they gave it to me ; and I threw it into the fire , and out came this cal@@ f . "
Moses said , " consec@@ rate yourselves today to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , yes , every man against his son , and against his brother ; that he may best@@ ow on you a blessing this day . "
Moses returned to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and said , " Oh , this people have sin@@ ned a great sin , and have made themselves gods of gold .
now go , lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you . behold , my angel shall go before you . nevertheless in the day when I punish , I will punish them for their sin . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke to Moses , " De@@ part , go up from here , you and the people that you have brought up out of the land of Egypt , to the land of which I s@@ wore to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , saying , ' I will give it to your seed . '
it happened that when Moses went out to the T@@ ent , that all the people rose up , and stood , everyone at their tent door , and watched Moses , until he had gone into the T@@ ent .
it happened , when Moses entered into the T@@ ent , that the pillar of cloud descended , stood at the door of the T@@ ent , and spoke with Moses .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke to Moses face to face , as a man speaks to his friend . he turned again into the camp , but his servant Joshua , the son of N@@ un , a young man , did@@ n '@@ t depart out of the T@@ ent .

the children of Israel went forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai ; and the cloud stayed in the wilderness of Par@@ an .
first , the standard of the camp of the children of Jud@@ ah went forward according to their armies . N@@ ah@@ sh@@ on the son of Am@@ min@@ ad@@ ab was over his army .
the standard of the camp of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im set forward according to their armies . Elis@@ h@@ ama the son of Am@@ mi@@ hud was over his army .
thus were the travels of the children of Israel according to their armies ; and they went forward .
Moses said to Hob@@ ab , the son of Re@@ u@@ el the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ite , Moses ' father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , " We are jour@@ ne@@ ying to the place of which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , ' I will give it to you . ' come with us , and we will treat you well ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken good concerning Israel . "
he said to him , " I will not go ; but I will depart to my own land , and to my relatives . "
they set forward from the Mount of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h three days ' journey . the ark of the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h went before them three days ' journey , to seek out a resting place for them .
it happened , when the ark went forward , that Moses said , " R@@ ise up , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and let your enemies be scattered ! let those who hate you flee before you ! "
the people were complaining in the ears of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h heard it , his anger was kind@@ led ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's fire burnt among them , and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp .
the mixed multitude that was among them lu@@ sted exceedingly : and the children of Israel also we@@ pt again , and said , " Who will give us flesh to eat ?
we remember the fish , which we ate in Egypt for nothing ; the c@@ uc@@ um@@ bers , and the mel@@ ons , and the le@@ eks , and the on@@ ions , and the garlic ;
but now we have lost our appetite . there is nothing at all except this man@@ na to look at . "
the people went around , gathered it , and ground it in mills , or beat it in mort@@ ars , and boiled it in pots , and made cakes of it . its taste was like the taste of fresh oil .
Moses said to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " Why have you treated with your servant so badly ? why haven '@@ t I found favor in your sight , that you lay the burden of all this people on me ?
where could I get meat to give to all this people ? for they we@@ ep to me , saying , ' Gi@@ ve us meat , that we may eat . '
if you treat me this way , please kill me right now , if I have found favor in your sight ; and don '@@ t let me see my w@@ ret@@ ch@@ edness . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " G@@ ather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel , whom you know to be the elders of the people , and officers over them ; and bring them to the T@@ ent of Meeting , that they may stand there with you .
I will come down and talk with you there . I will take of the Spirit which is on you , and will put it on them ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you , that you not bear it yourself alone .
Moses said , " The people , among whom I am , are six hundred thousand men on foot ; and you have said , ' I will give them flesh , that they may eat a whole month . '
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " Has Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's hand grown short ? now you will see whether my word will happen to you or not . "
a wind from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h went out and brought qu@@ ails from the sea , and let them fall by the camp , about a day 's journey on this side , and a day 's journey on the other side , around the camp , and about two cub@@ its above the surface of the earth .
the people rose up all that day , and all the night , and all the next day , and gathered the qu@@ ails . he who gathered least gathered ten hom@@ ers ; and they spread them all abroad for themselves around the camp .
while the flesh was yet between their teeth , before it was chew@@ ed , the anger of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was kind@@ led against the people , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h struck the people with a very great plague .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke suddenly to Moses , to Aaron , and to Mi@@ ri@@ am , " You three come out to the T@@ ent of Meeting ! " the three of them came out .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came down in a pillar of cloud , and stood at the door of the T@@ ent , and called Aaron and Mi@@ ri@@ am ; and they both came forward .
he said , " He@@ ar now my words . if there is a prophet among you , I Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will make myself known to him in a vision . I will speak with him in a dream .
with him I will speak mouth to mouth , even plainly , and not in rid@@ dles ; and he shall see Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's form . why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant , against Moses ? "
Moses sent them to spy out the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and said to them , " Go up this way by the South , and go up into the hill country :
they came to the valley of E@@ sh@@ col , and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes , and they bore it on a staff between two . they also brought some of the p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates and fi@@ gs .
Cal@@ eb sti@@ l@@ led the people before Moses , and said , " Let us go up at once , and possess it ; for we are well able to overcome it . "
all the children of Israel mur@@ mu@@ red against Moses and against Aaron : and the whole congregation said to them , " W@@ ould that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would that we had died in this wilderness !
then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel .
Joshua the son of N@@ un and Cal@@ eb the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h , who were of those who sp@@ ied out the land , t@@ ore their clothes :
only don '@@ t rebel against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , neither fear the people of the land ; for they are bread for us : their defense is removed from over them , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is with us . Don '@@ t fear them . "
but all the congregation threatened to stone them with stones . the glory of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h appeared in the T@@ ent of Meeting to all the children of Israel .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " How long will this people desp@@ ise me ? and how long will they not believe in me , for all the signs which I have worked among them ?
because all those men who have seen my glory , and my signs , which I worked in Egypt and in the wilderness , yet have tempted me these ten times , and have not listened to my voice ;
tell them , ' As I live , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , surely as you have spoken in my ears , so will I do to you :
your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness ; and all who were numbered of you , according to your whole number , from twenty years old and upward , who have mur@@ mu@@ red against me ,
surely you shall not come into the land , concerning which I s@@ wore that I would make you dwell therein , except Cal@@ eb the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h , and Joshua the son of N@@ un .
after the number of the days in which you sp@@ ied out the land , even forty days , for every day a year , you will bear your ini@@ qu@@ ities , even forty years , and you will know my alienation . '
I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have spoken , surely this will I do to all this evil congregation , who are gathered together against me : in this wilderness they shall be consumed , and there they shall die . "
the men , whom Moses sent to spy out the land , who returned , and made all the congregation to mur@@ mur against him , by bringing up an evil report against the land ,
they rose up early in the morning , and went up to the top of the mountain , saying , " Be@@ hold , we are here , and will go up to the place which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has promised : for we have sin@@ ned . "
Moses said , " Why now do you dis@@ obey the commandment of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , since it shall not prosper ?
then the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ite came down , and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite who lived in that mountain , and struck them and beat them down , even to Hor@@ ma@@ h .
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you have come into the land of your hab@@ itations , which I give to you ,
then he who offers his offering shall offer to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h a meal offering of a tenth part of an ep@@ ha@@ h of fine flour mixed with the fourth part of a H@@ in of oil :
when you prepare a bull for a burnt offering , or for a sacrifice , to accomplish a vo@@ w , or for peace offerings to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ;
then shall he offer with the bull a meal offering of three tenth parts of an ep@@ ha@@ h of fine flour mixed with half a H@@ in of oil :
if a stranger lives as a foreigner with you , or whoever may be among you throughout your generations , and will offer an offering made by fire , of a pleasant aroma to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; as you do , so he shall do .
for the assembly , there shall be one statute for you , and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner , a statute forever throughout your generations : as you are , so shall the foreigner be before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
one law and one ordin@@ ance shall be for you , and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner with you . ' "
the priest shall make at@@ onement for all the congregation of the children of Israel , and they shall be forgiven ; for it was an error , and they have brought their offering , an offering made by fire to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and their sin offering before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , for their error :
" ' if one person sins unwit@@ tingly , then he shall offer a female goat a year old for a sin offering .
the priest shall make at@@ onement for the soul who err@@ s , when he sins unwit@@ tingly , before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to make at@@ onement for him ; and he shall be forgiven .
you shall have one law for him who does anything unwit@@ tingly , for him who is native @@@ -@@ @ born among the children of Israel , and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them .
while the children of Israel were in the wilderness , they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day .
" speak to the children of Israel , and tell them that they should make themselves fring@@ es in the borders of their garments throughout their generations , and that they put on the fring@@ e of each border a cord of blue :
and they rose up before Moses , with certain of the children of Israel , two hundred fifty princes of the congregation , called to the assembly , men of renow@@ n ;
and put fire in them , and put inc@@ ense on them before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h tomorrow : and it shall be that the man whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h chooses , he shall be holy . you have gone too far , you sons of Lev@@ i ! "
is it a small thing to you , that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel , to bring you near to himself , to do the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and to stand before the congregation to minister to them ;
and that he has brought you near , and all your brothers the sons of Lev@@ i with you ? and do you seek the priesthood also ?
therefore you and all your company are gathered together against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : and Aaron , what is he that you mur@@ mur against him ? "
Moses sent to call Da@@ than and A@@ bir@@ am , the sons of Eli@@ ab ; and they said , " We won '@@ t come up :
is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey , to kill us in the wilderness , but you must also make yourself a prince over us ?
moreover you haven '@@ t brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey , nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards : will you put out the eyes of these men ? we won '@@ t come up . "
Kor@@ ah assembled all the congregation against them to the door of the T@@ ent of Meeting : and the glory of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h appeared to all the congregation .
" separate yourselves from among this congregation , that I may consume them in a moment ! "
they fell on their faces , and said , " God , the God of the spirits of all flesh , shall one man sin , and will you be angry with all the congregation ? "
he spoke to the congregation , saying , " De@@ part , please , from the tents of these wicked men , and touch nothing of theirs , lest you be consumed in all their sins ! "
so they went away from the tent of Kor@@ ah , Da@@ than , and A@@ bir@@ am , on every side : and Da@@ than and A@@ bir@@ am came out , and stood at the door of their tents , and their wives , and their sons , and their little ones .
but if Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h make a new thing , and the ground open its mouth , and swallow them up , with all that ap@@ per@@ tain to them , and they go down alive into She@@ ol ; then you shall understand that these men have desp@@ ised Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
and the earth opened its mouth , and swallowed them up , and their households , and all the men who ap@@ per@@ tained to Kor@@ ah , and all their goods .
so they , and all that ap@@ per@@ tained to them , went down alive into She@@ ol : and the earth closed on them , and they perished from among the assembly .
Ele@@ az@@ ar the priest took the bronze cens@@ ers , which those who were burnt had offered ; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar ,
it happened , when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron , that they looked toward the T@@ ent of Meeting : and behold , the cloud covered it , and the glory of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h appeared .
Moses said to Aaron , " Take your cen@@ ser , and put fire from off the altar in it , and lay inc@@ ense on it , and carry it quickly to the congregation , and make at@@ onement for them ; for wrath has gone out from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ! the plague has begun . "
Aaron did as Moses said , and ran into the midst of the assembly ; and behold , the plague has begun among the people : and he put on the inc@@ ense , and made at@@ onement for the people .
" speak to the children of Israel , and take of them rods , one for each fathers ' house , of all their princes according to their fathers ' houses , twelve rods : write every man 's name on his rod .
you shall write Aaron 's name on the rod of Lev@@ i ; for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers ' houses .
Moses spoke to the children of Israel ; and all their princes gave him rods , for each prince one , according to their fathers ' houses , even twelve rods : and the rod of Aaron was among their rods .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " P@@ ut back the rod of Aaron before the testimony , to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion ; that you may make an end of their mur@@ mur@@ ings against me , that they not die . "
everyone who comes near , who comes near to the tab@@ ern@@ acle of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , dies ! will we all perish ? "
your brothers also , the tribe of Lev@@ i , the tribe of your father , bring near with you , that they may be joined to you , and minister to you : but you and your sons with you shall be before the tent of the testimony .
they shall keep your commands , and the duty of all the T@@ ent : only they shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar , that they not die , neither they , nor you .
they shall be joined to you , and keep the responsibility of the T@@ ent of Meeting , for all the service of the T@@ ent : and a stranger shall not come near to you .
I , behold , I have taken your brothers the Lev@@ ites from among the children of Israel : to you they are a gift , given to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to do the service of the T@@ ent of Meeting .
you shall eat of it like the most holy things . every male shall eat of it . it shall be holy to you .
everything that opens the womb , of all flesh which they offer to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , both of man and animal shall be yours : nevertheless you shall surely re@@ deem the fir@@ st@@ born of man , and you shall re@@ deem the fir@@ st@@ born of un@@ clean animals .
you shall re@@ deem those who are to be re@@ deemed of them from a month old , according to your estimation , for five she@@ k@@ els of money , after the she@@ kel of the sanctuary ( the same is twenty ger@@ ahs ) .
their flesh shall be yours , as the wave offering breast and as the right thi@@ gh , it shall be yours .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Aaron , " You shall have no inheritance in their land , neither shall you have any portion among them . I am your portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel .
" to the children of Lev@@ i , behold , I have given all the ti@@ the in Israel for an inheritance , in return for their service which they serve , even the service of the T@@ ent of Meeting .
but the Lev@@ ites shall do the service of the T@@ ent of Meeting , and they shall bear their ini@@ qu@@ ity : it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations ; and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance .
" moreover you shall speak to the Lev@@ ites , and tell them , ' When you take of the children of Israel the ti@@ the which I have given you from them for your inheritance , then you shall offer up a wave offering of it for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , a ti@@ the of the ti@@ the .
thus you also shall offer a wave offering to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of all your ti@@ thes , which you receive of the children of Israel ; and of it you shall give Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's wave offering to Aaron the priest .
you shall eat it in every place , you and your households : for it is your reward in return for your service in the T@@ ent of Meeting .
" this is the statute of the law which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has commanded : speak to the children of Israel , that they bring you a red hei@@ fer without spot , in which is no bl@@ emish , and which was never y@@ oked .
and Ele@@ az@@ ar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger , and sprink@@ le her blood toward the front of the T@@ ent of Meeting seven times .
one shall burn the hei@@ fer in his sight ; her skin , and her flesh , and her blood , with her d@@ ung , shall he burn :
and the priest shall take c@@ edar wood , and h@@ ys@@ so@@ p , and scar@@ let , and cast it into the midst of the burning of the hei@@ fer .
then the priest shall wash his clothes , and he shall ba@@ the his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be un@@ clean until the evening .
he who g@@ athers the ashes of the hei@@ fer shall wash his clothes , and be un@@ clean until the evening : and it shall be to the children of Israel , and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them , for a statute forever .
the same shall puri@@ fy himself with water on the third day , and on the seventh day he shall be clean : but if he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t puri@@ fy himself the third day , then the seventh day he shall not be clean .
" whoever in the open field touches one who is sl@@ ain with a sword , or a dead body , or a bone of a man , or a grave , shall be un@@ clean seven days .
and the clean person shall sprink@@ le on the un@@ clean on the third day , and on the seventh day : and on the seventh day he shall puri@@ fy him ; and he shall wash his clothes , and ba@@ the himself in water , and shall be clean at evening .
it shall be a perpetual statute to them : and he who sprink@@ les the water for imp@@ urity shall wash his clothes , and he who touches the water for imp@@ urity shall be un@@ clean until evening .
the children of Israel , even the whole congregation , came into the wilderness of Z@@ in in the first month : and the people stayed in Kad@@ esh ; and Mi@@ ri@@ am died there , and was buried there .
Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the T@@ ent of Meeting , and fell on their faces : and the glory of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h appeared to them .
Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock , and he said to them , " He@@ ar now , you rebels ; shall we bring you water out of this rock for you ? "
and when we cried to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , he heard our voice , and sent an angel , and brought us forth out of Egypt : and behold , we are in Kad@@ esh , a city in the utter@@ most of your border .
E@@ dom said to him , " You shall not pass through me , lest I come out with the sword against you . "
he said , " You shall not pass through . " E@@ dom came out against him with many people , and with a strong hand .
they traveled from Kad@@ esh : and the children of Israel , even the whole congregation , came to Mount H@@ or .
" Aaron shall be gathered to his people ; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel , because you reb@@ elled against my word at the waters of M@@ eri@@ ba@@ h .
when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead , they we@@ pt for Aaron thirty days , even all the house of Israel .
the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , the king of Ara@@ d , who lived in the South , heard tell that Israel came by the way of Ath@@ ari@@ m ; and he fought against Israel , and took some of them captive .
Israel vowed a vo@@ w to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and said , " If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand , then I will utterly destroy their cities . "
the people spoke against God , and against Moses , " Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness ? for there is no bread , and there is no water ; and our soul lo@@ ath@@ es this light bread . "
Moses made a ser@@ pent of brass , and set it on the standard : and it happened , that if a ser@@ pent had bit@@ ten any man , when he looked to the ser@@ pent of brass , he lived .
from there they traveled to Be@@ er : that is the well of which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " G@@ ather the people together , and I will give them water . "
and from Bam@@ o@@ th to the valley that is in the field of Mo@@ ab , to the top of Pis@@ g@@ ah , which looks down on the desert .
" let me pass through your land : we will not turn aside into field , or into viney@@ ard ; we will not drink of the water of the wells : we will go by the king 's highway , until we have passed your border . "
Si@@ hon would not allow Israel to pass through his border : but Si@@ hon gathered all his people together , and went out against Israel into the wilderness , and came to Ja@@ haz ; and he fought against Israel .
Israel struck him with the edge of the sword , and possessed his land from the Ar@@ non to the Jab@@ bo@@ k , even to the children of Am@@ mon ; for the border of the children of Am@@ mon was strong .
for H@@ esh@@ bon was the city of Si@@ hon the king of the A@@ mor@@ ites , who had fought against the former king of Mo@@ ab , and taken all his land out of his hand , even to the Ar@@ non .
we have shot at them . H@@ esh@@ bon has perished even to Di@@ bon . we have laid waste even to N@@ op@@ ha@@ h , Which reaches to Me@@ deb@@ a . "
they turned and went up by the way of Bash@@ an : and O@@ g the king of Bash@@ an went out against them , he and all his people , to battle at E@@ dre@@ i .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " Don '@@ t fear him : for I have delivered him into your hand , and all his people , and his land ; and you shall do to him as you did to Si@@ hon king of the A@@ mor@@ ites , who lived at H@@ esh@@ bon . "
Mo@@ ab said to the elders of Mi@@ dian , " Now this multitude will l@@ ick up all that is around us , as the ox lic@@ ks up the grass of the field . " Bal@@ ak the son of Zi@@ pp@@ or was king of Mo@@ ab at that time .
the elders of Mo@@ ab and the elders of Mi@@ dian departed with the rewards of div@@ ination in their hand ; and they came to Bal@@ a@@ am , and spoke to him the words of Bal@@ ak .
he said to them , " Lodge here this night , and I will bring you word again , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall speak to me . " the princes of Mo@@ ab stayed with Bal@@ a@@ am .
'@@ Be@@ hold , the people that has come out of Egypt , it covers the surface of the earth : now , come curse me them ; perhaps I shall be able to fight against them , and shall drive them out . ' "
God said to Bal@@ a@@ am , " You shall not go with them . you shall not curse the people ; for they are blessed . "
Bal@@ a@@ am rose up in the morning , and said to the princes of Bal@@ ak , " Go to your land ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h refuses to permit me to go with you . "
they came to Bal@@ a@@ am , and said to him , " Th@@ us says Bal@@ ak the son of Zi@@ pp@@ or , ' Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me :
for I will promote you to very great honor , and whatever you say to me I will do . please come therefore , and curse this people for me . ' "
God came to Bal@@ a@@ am at night , and said to him , " If the men have come to call you , rise up , go with them ; but only the word which I speak to you , that you shall do . "
God 's anger was kind@@ led because he went ; and the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h placed himself in the way for an adversary against him . now he was riding on his don@@ key , and his two servants were with him .
the don@@ key saw the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h standing in the way , with his sword drawn in his hand ; and the don@@ key turned aside out of the way , and went into the field : and Bal@@ a@@ am struck the don@@ key , to turn her into the way .
then the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h stood in a narrow path between the vineyards , a wall being on this side , and a wall on that side .
the don@@ key saw the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and she thrust herself to the wall , and crushed Bal@@ a@@ am 's foot against the wall : and he struck her again .
the don@@ key saw the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and she lay down under Bal@@ a@@ am : and Bal@@ a@@ am 's anger was kind@@ led , and he struck the don@@ key with his staff .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h opened the mouth of the don@@ key , and she said to Bal@@ a@@ am , " What have I done to you , that you have struck me these three times ? "
the don@@ key said to Bal@@ a@@ am , " Am I not your don@@ key , on which you have ridden all your life long to this day ? was I ever in the habit of doing so to you ? " he said , " No . "
then Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h opened the eyes of Bal@@ a@@ am , and he saw the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h standing in the way , with his sword drawn in his hand ; and he bowed his head , and fell on his face .
the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Bal@@ a@@ am , " Go with the men ; but only the word that I shall speak to you , that you shall speak . " so Bal@@ a@@ am went with the princes of Bal@@ ak .
when Bal@@ ak heard that Bal@@ a@@ am had come , he went out to meet him to the City of Mo@@ ab , which is on the border of the Ar@@ non , which is in the utmost part of the border .
Bal@@ ak said to Bal@@ a@@ am , " did@@ n '@@ t I ear@@ ne@@ stly send to you to call you ? why did@@ n '@@ t you come to me ? am I not able indeed to promote you to honor ? "
Bal@@ a@@ am said to Bal@@ ak , " Be@@ hold , I have come to you : have I now any power at all to speak anything ? the word that God puts in my mouth , that shall I speak . "
God met Bal@@ a@@ am : and he said to him , " I have prepared the seven al@@ t@@ ars , and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h put a word in Bal@@ a@@ am 's mouth , and said , " Return to Bal@@ ak , and thus you shall speak . "
who can count the dust of Jacob , or number the fourth part of Israel ? let me die the death of the righteous ! let my last end be like his ! "
Bal@@ ak said to him , " Please come with me to another place , where you may see them ; you shall see but the utmost part of them , and shall not see them all : and curse me them from there . "
he came to him , and behold , he was standing by his burnt offering , and the princes of Mo@@ ab with him . Bal@@ ak said to him , " What has Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoken ? "
he took up his parable , and said , " R@@ ise up , Bal@@ ak , and hear ! listen to me , you son of Zi@@ pp@@ or .
surely there is no enchan@@ tment with Jacob ; N@@ either is there any div@@ ination with Israel . now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel , What has God done !
Bal@@ ak said to Bal@@ a@@ am , " Come now , I will take you to another place ; perhaps it will please God that you may curse me them from there . "
when Bal@@ a@@ am saw that it pleased Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to bless Israel , he did@@ n '@@ t go , as at the other times , to meet with enchan@@ tments , but he set his face toward the wilderness .
Bal@@ a@@ am lifted up his eyes , and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes ; and the Spirit of God came on him .
water shall flow from his buc@@ kets . his seed shall be in many waters . his king shall be higher than Ag@@ ag . his kingdom shall be exalted .
Bal@@ ak 's anger was kind@@ led against Bal@@ a@@ am , and he struck his hands together ; and Bal@@ ak said to Bal@@ a@@ am , " I called you to curse my enemies , and , behold , you have altogether blessed them these three times .
therefore now flee you to your place ! I thought to promote you to great honor ; but , behold , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has kept you back from honor . "
he took up his parable , and said , " Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Be@@ or says , the man whose eye was closed says ;
he looked at A@@ mal@@ ek , and took up his parable , and said , " A@@ mal@@ ek was the first of the nations , But his latter end shall come to destruction . "
for they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods ; and the people ate , and bowed down to their gods .
Moses said to the judges of Israel , " Everyone kill his men who have joined themselves to Ba@@ al Pe@@ or . "
and it shall be to him , and to his seed after him , the covenant of an everlasting priesthood ; because he was jeal@@ ous for his God , and made at@@ onement for the children of Israel . ' "
it happened after the plague , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke to Moses and to Ele@@ az@@ ar the son of Aaron the priest , saying ,
the sons of Eli@@ ab : Nem@@ u@@ el , and Da@@ than , and A@@ bir@@ am . these are that Da@@ than and A@@ bir@@ am , who were called of the congregation , who stro@@ ve against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Kor@@ ah , when they stro@@ ve against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ,
these are those who were numbered of the children of Israel , six hundred one thousand seven hundred thirty .
to the more you shall give the more inheritance , and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance : to everyone according to those who were numbered of him shall his inheritance be given .
notwithstanding , the land shall be divided by lot : according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit .
the name of Am@@ ram 's wife was Jo@@ che@@ bed , the daughter of Lev@@ i , who was born to Lev@@ i in Egypt : and she bore to Am@@ ram Aaron and Moses , and Mi@@ ri@@ am their sister .
those who were numbered of them were twenty @@@ -@@ @ three thousand , every male from a month old and upward : for they were not numbered among the children of Israel , because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel .
these are those who were numbered by Moses and Ele@@ az@@ ar the priest , who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Mo@@ ab by the Jordan at Jer@@ ich@@ o .
but among these there was not a man of them who were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest , who numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai .
for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had said of them , They shall surely die in the wilderness . there was not left a man of them , except Cal@@ eb the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h , and Joshua the son of N@@ un .
" our father died in the wilderness , and he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in the company of Kor@@ ah : but he died in his own sin ; and he had no sons .
why should the name of our father be taken away from among his family , because he had no son ? give to us a possession among the brothers of our father . "
you shall speak to the children of Israel , saying , ' If a man dies , and has no son , then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter .
if his father has no brothers , then you shall give his inheritance to his kin@@ sman who is next to him of his family , and he shall possess it : and it shall be to the children of Israel a statute and ordin@@ ance , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h commanded Moses . ' "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " Go up into this mountain of Ab@@ ari@@ m , and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel .
" let Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of the spirits of all flesh , appoint a man over the congregation ,
who may go out before them , and who may come in before them , and who may lead them out , and who may bring them in ; that the congregation of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h not be as sheep which have no shepherd . "
you shall put of your honor on him , that all the congregation of the children of Israel may obey .
" command the children of Israel , and tell them , ' My offering , my food for my offerings made by fire , of a pleasant aroma to me , you shall observe to offer to me in their due season . '
with the tenth part of an ep@@ ha@@ h of fine flour for a meal offering , mixed with the fourth part of a H@@ in of beaten oil .
it is a continual burnt offering , which was ordained in Mount Sinai for a pleasant aroma , an offering made by fire to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
the other lamb you shall offer at evening : as the meal offering of the morning , and as the drink offering of it , you shall offer it , an offering made by fire , of a pleasant aroma to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
" ' on the Sabbath day two male lam@@ bs a year old without bl@@ emish , and two tenth parts of an ep@@ ha@@ h of fine flour for a meal offering , mixed with oil , and the drink offering of it :
this is the burnt offering of every Sabbath , besides the continual burnt offering , and the drink offering of it .
and three tenth parts of an ep@@ ha@@ h of fine flour for a meal offering , mixed with oil , for each bull ; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal offering , mixed with oil , for the one ram ;
and a tenth part of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal offering to every lamb ; for a burnt offering of a pleasant aroma , an offering made by fire to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
one male goat for a sin offering to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; it shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering , and the drink offering of it .
on the fif@@ teenth day of this month shall be a feast : seven days shall un@@ leav@@ ened bread be eaten .
but you shall offer an offering made by fire , a burnt offering to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : two young bul@@ ls , and one ram , and seven male lam@@ bs a year old ; they shall be to you without bl@@ emish ;
" ' also in the day of the first fruits , when you offer a new meal offering to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in your feast of weeks , you shall have a holy convocation ; you shall do no serv@@ ile work ;
but you shall offer a burnt offering for a pleasant aroma to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : two young bul@@ ls , one ram , seven male lam@@ bs a year old ;
besides the continual burnt offering , and the meal offering of it , you shall offer them ( they shall be to you without bl@@ emish ) , and their drink offerings .
" ' in the seventh month , on the first day of the month , you shall have a holy convocation ; you shall do no serv@@ ile work : it is a day of blowing of trum@@ pets to you .
you shall offer a burnt offering for a pleasant aroma to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : one young bull , one ram , seven male lam@@ bs a year old without bl@@ emish ;
" ' on the tenth day of this seventh month you shall have a holy convocation ; and you shall aff@@ l@@ ict your souls : you shall do no kind of work ;
but you shall offer a burnt offering to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h for a pleasant aroma : one young bull , one ram , seven male lam@@ bs a year old ; they shall be to you without bl@@ emish ;
and one male goat for a sin offering , besides the continual burnt offering , the meal offering of it , and the drink offering of it .
" ' on the second day you shall offer twelve young bul@@ ls , two r@@ ams , fourteen male lam@@ bs a year old without bl@@ emish ;
and their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bul@@ ls , for the r@@ ams , and for the lam@@ bs , according to their number , after the ordin@@ ance ;
and one male goat for a sin offering ; besides the continual burnt offering , and the meal offering of it , and their drink offerings .
and their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bul@@ ls , for the r@@ ams , and for the lam@@ bs , according to their number , after the ordin@@ ance ;
their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bul@@ ls , for the r@@ ams , and for the lam@@ bs , according to their number , after the ordin@@ ance ;
and their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bul@@ ls , for the r@@ ams , and for the lam@@ bs , according to their number , after the ordin@@ ance ;
and their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bul@@ ls , for the r@@ ams , and for the lam@@ bs , according to their number , after the ordin@@ ance ;
and their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bul@@ ls , for the r@@ ams , and for the lam@@ bs , according to their number , after the ordin@@ ance ;
" ' on the eighth day you shall have a solemn assembly : you shall do no serv@@ ile work ;
" ' you shall offer these to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in your set fe@@ asts , besides your v@@ ows , and your fre@@ e@@ will offerings , for your burnt offerings , and for your meal offerings , and for your drink offerings , and for your peace offerings . ' "
Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel , saying , " This is the thing which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has commanded .
and her husband hears it , and hold his peace at her in the day that he hears it ; then her v@@ ows shall stand , and her bonds with which she has bound her soul shall stand .
" but the vo@@ w of a widow , or of her who is divorced , everything with which she has bound her soul , shall stand against her .
Moses spoke to the people , saying , " Ar@@ m men from among you for the war , that they may go against Mi@@ dian , to execute Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's vengeance on Mi@@ dian .
so there were delivered , out of the thousands of Israel , a thousand of every tribe , twelve thousand armed for war .
Moses sent them , one thousand of every tribe , to the war , them and Ph@@ ine@@ has the son of Ele@@ az@@ ar the priest , to the war , with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trum@@ pets for the alarm in his hand .
they killed the kings of Mi@@ dian with the rest of their sl@@ ain : Ev@@ i , and Re@@ ke@@ m , and z@@ ur , and H@@ ur , and Re@@ ba , the five kings of Mi@@ dian : Bal@@ a@@ am also the son of Be@@ or they killed with the sword .
the children of Israel took captive the women of Mi@@ dian and their little ones ; and all their livestock , and all their f@@ locks , and all their goods , they took for a prey .
all their cities in the places in which they lived , and all their enc@@ amp@@ ments , they burnt with fire .
they brought the cap@@ tives , and the prey , and the spoil , to Moses , and to Ele@@ az@@ ar the priest , and to the congregation of the children of Israel , to the camp at the plains of Mo@@ ab , which are by the Jordan at Jer@@ ich@@ o .
behold , these caused the children of Israel , through the counsel of Bal@@ a@@ am , to commit t@@ resp@@ ass against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in the matter of Pe@@ or , and so the plague was among the congregation of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
" En@@ camp outside of the camp seven days : whoever has killed any person , and whoever has touched any sl@@ ain , puri@@ fy yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day , you and your cap@@ tives .
lev@@ y a tribute to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of the men of war who went out to battle : one soul of five hundred ; of the persons , of the cattle , of the don@@ keys , and of the f@@ locks .
the half , which was the portion of those who went out to war , was in number three hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ seven thousand five hundred sheep :
the don@@ keys were thirty thousand five hundred ; of which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's tribute was sixty @@@ -@@ @ one .
Moses gave the tribute , which was Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's wave offering , to Ele@@ az@@ ar the priest , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h commanded Moses .
we have brought Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's offering , what every man has gotten , of jew@@ els of gold , arm@@ lets , and brac@@ elets , sig@@ net rings , ear@@ rings , and nec@@ kl@@ aces , to make at@@ onement for our souls before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
Moses and Ele@@ az@@ ar the priest took the gold of the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , and brought it into the T@@ ent of Meeting , for a memorial for the children of Israel before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
they said , " If we have found favor in your sight , let this land be given to your servants for a possession ; don '@@ t bring us over the Jordan . "
Moses said to the children of G@@ ad , and to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , " Sh@@ all your brothers go to the war , and shall you sit here ?
why do you discourage the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has given them ?
for when they went up to the valley of E@@ sh@@ col , and saw the land , they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had given them .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's anger was kind@@ led against Israel , and he made them wander back and forth in the wilderness forty years , until all the generation , who had done evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , was consumed .
" behold , you have risen up in your fathers ' place , an increase of sinful men , to au@@ gment yet the fierce anger of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h toward Israel .
for if you turn away from after him , he will yet again leave them in the wilderness ; and you will destroy all this people . "
but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel , until we have brought them to their place : and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
for we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan , and forward ; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward . "
Moses said to them , " If you will do this thing , if you will arm yourselves to go before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to the war ,
and the land is subdued before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; then afterward you shall return , and be guil@@ tless towards Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and towards Israel ; and this land shall be to you for a possession before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
build cities for your little ones , and fol@@ ds for your sheep ; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth . "
the children of G@@ ad and the children of Re@@ ub@@ en spoke to Moses , saying , " Your servants will do as my lord commands .
our little ones , our wives , our f@@ locks , and all our livestock , shall be there in the cities of Gil@@ e@@ ad ;
Moses said to them , " If the children of G@@ ad and the children of Re@@ ub@@ en will pass with you over the Jordan , every man who is armed to battle , before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the land shall be subdued before you ; then you shall give them the land of Gil@@ e@@ ad for a possession :
the children of G@@ ad and the children of Re@@ ub@@ en answered , saying , " As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has said to your servants , so will we do .
we will pass over armed before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h into the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan . "
Moses wrote their go@@ ings out according to their journeys by the commandment of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : and these are their journeys according to their go@@ ings out .
they traveled from before Ha@@ hi@@ ro@@ th , and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness : and they went three days ' journey in the wilderness of Eth@@ am , and enc@@ amped in Mar@@ ah .
Aaron the priest went up into Mount H@@ or at the commandment of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and died there , in the forti@@ eth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt , in the fifth month , on the first day of the month .
then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you , destroy all their stone idols , destroy all their mol@@ ten images , and demol@@ ish all their high places .
you shall take possession of the land , and dwell therein ; for I have given given the land to you to possess it .
" but if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you , then those you let remain of them will be as pr@@ icks in your eyes and as thor@@ ns in your sides , and they will har@@ ass you in the land in which you dwell .
" command the children of Israel , and tell them , ' When you come into the land of Can@@ a@@ an ( this is the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance , even the land of Can@@ a@@ an according to its borders ) ,
then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Z@@ in along by the side of E@@ dom , and your south border shall be from the end of the Salt Sea eastward ;
and your border shall turn about sou@@ th@@ ward of the ascent of Ak@@ rab@@ bi@@ m , and pass along to Z@@ in ; and the go@@ ings out of it shall be sou@@ th@@ ward of Kad@@ esh Bar@@ ne@@ a ; and it shall go forth to Haz@@ ar Ad@@ dar , and pass along to Az@@ mon ;
" ' for the western border , you shall have the great sea and its border : this shall be your west border .
and the border shall go forth to Zi@@ ph@@ ron , and the go@@ ings out of it shall be at Haz@@ ar En@@ an : this shall be your north border .
and the border shall go down to the Jordan , and the go@@ ings out of it shall be at the Salt Sea . this shall be your land according to its borders around it . ' "
Moses commanded the children of Israel , saying , " This is the land which you shall inherit by lot , which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has commanded to give to the nine tribes , and to the half @@@ -@@ @ tribe ;
these are the names of the men : of the tribe of Jud@@ ah , Cal@@ eb the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h .
these are they whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h commanded to divide the inheritance to the children of Israel in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
" command the children of Israel that they give to the Lev@@ ites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in ; and you shall give suburbs for the cities around them to the Lev@@ ites .
the cities shall they have to dwell in ; and their suburbs shall be for their livestock , and for their substance , and for all their animals .
" the suburbs of the cities , which you shall give to the Lev@@ ites , shall be from the wall of the city and outward one thousand cub@@ its around it .
" the cities which you shall give to the Lev@@ ites , they shall be the six cities of refuge , which you shall give for the man@@ s@@ layer to flee to : and besides them you shall give forty @@@ -@@ @ two cities .
you shall give three cities beyond the Jordan , and you shall give three cities in the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; they shall be cities of refuge .
for the children of Israel , and for the stranger and for the foreigner living among them , shall these six cities be for refuge ; that everyone who kills any person unwit@@ tingly may flee there .
if he struck him with a stone in the hand , by which a man may die , and he died , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand , by which a man may die , and he died , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
the Av@@ enger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death : when he meets him , he shall put him to death .
or in enmity struck him with his hand , so that he died ; he who struck him shall surely be put to death ; he is a murderer : the Av@@ enger of blood shall put the murderer to death , when he meets him .
and the congregation shall deliver the man@@ s@@ layer out of the hand of the Av@@ enger of blood , and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge , where he was fled : and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest , who was ano@@ inted with the holy oil .
and the Av@@ enger of blood find him outside of the border of his city of refuge , and the Av@@ enger of blood kill the man@@ s@@ layer ; he shall not be guilty of blood ,
because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the man@@ s@@ layer shall return into the land of his possession .
" ' whoever kills any person , the murderer shall be sl@@ ain at the mouth of witnesses : but one witness shall not testify against any person that he die .
and they said , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lord was commanded by Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to give the inheritance of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had our brother to his daughters .
when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be , then will their inheritance be added to the inheritance of the tribe where@@ unto they shall belong : so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers . "
Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , saying , " The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks right .
this is the thing which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h does command concerning the daughters of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had , saying , Let them be married to whom they think best ; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married .
so shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe ; for the children of Israel shall all keep the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father , that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers .
for Mah@@ lah , Tir@@ z@@ ah , and H@@ og@@ lah , and Mil@@ ca@@ h , and Noah , the daughters of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had , were married to their father 's brothers ' sons .
they were married into the families of the sons of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h the son of Joseph ; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father .
these are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness , in the Arab@@ ah over against Sup@@ h , between Par@@ an , and T@@ oph@@ el , and Lab@@ an , and Haz@@ ero@@ th , and D@@ iz@@ a@@ hab .
behold , I have set the land before you : go in and possess the land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h s@@ wore to your fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , to give to them and to their seed after them . "
I spoke to you at that time , saying , " I am not able to bear you myself alone :
so I took the heads of your tribes , wise men , and known , and made them heads over you , cap@@ tains of thousands , and cap@@ tains of hundreds , and cap@@ tains of fif@@ ties , and cap@@ tains of tens , and officers , according to your tribes .
I commanded your judges at that time , saying , " He@@ ar cases between your brothers , and judge righte@@ ously between a man and his brother , and the foreigner who is living with him .
I said to you , " You have come to the hill country of the A@@ mor@@ ites , which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God gives to us .
behold , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God has set the land before you : go up , take possession , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fathers , has spoken to you ; don '@@ t be afraid , neither be dis@@ may@@ ed . "
they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down to us , and brought us word again , and said , " It is a good land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God gives to us . "
and you mur@@ mu@@ red in your tents , and said , " Because Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h hated us , he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt , to deliver us into the hand of the A@@ mor@@ ites , to destroy us .
where are we going up ? our brothers have made our heart to melt , saying , ' The people are greater and taller than we ; the cities are great and fortified up to the sky ; and moreover we have seen the sons of the An@@ ak@@ im there . ' "
except Cal@@ eb the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h : he shall see it ; and to him will I give the land that he has tro@@ dden on , and to his children , because he has wholly followed Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
Joshua the son of N@@ un , who stands before you , he shall go in there : encourage you him ; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to me , " Tell them , ' Don '@@ t go up , neither fight ; for I am not among you ; lest you be struck before your enemies . ' "
then we turned , and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke to me ; and we en@@ cir@@ cled Mount Se@@ ir many days .
command the people , saying , ' You are to pass through the border of your brothers the children of Es@@ au , who dwell in Se@@ ir ; and they will be afraid of you : take good heed to yourselves therefore ;
so we passed by from our brothers the children of Es@@ au , who dwell in Se@@ ir , from the way of the Arab@@ ah from El@@ ath and from E@@ z@@ ion Ge@@ ber . we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Mo@@ ab .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to me , " Don '@@ t bother Mo@@ ab , neither contend with them in battle ; for I will not give you of his land for a possession ; because I have given A@@ r to the children of L@@ ot for a possession . "
the Hor@@ ites also lived in Se@@ ir before , but the children of Es@@ au succeeded them ; and they destroyed them from before them , and lived in their place ; as Israel did to the land of his possession , which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h gave to them . )
so it happened , when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people ,
and the Av@@ vi@@ m , who lived in villages as far as Gaza , the Cap@@ ht@@ ori@@ m , who came forth out of Cap@@ h@@ tor , destroyed them , and lived in their place . )
" rise up , take your journey , and pass over the valley of the Ar@@ non : behold , I have given into your hand Si@@ hon the A@@ mor@@ ite , king of H@@ esh@@ bon , and his land ; begin to possess it , and contend with him in battle .
only the livestock we took for a prey to ourselves , with the spoil of the cities which we had taken .
from A@@ ro@@ er , which is on the edge of the valley of the Ar@@ non , and the city that is in the valley , even to Gil@@ e@@ ad , there was not a city too high for us ; Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God delivered up all before us :
we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the A@@ mor@@ ites who were beyond the Jordan , from the valley of the Ar@@ non to Mount Her@@ mon .
( for only O@@ g king of Bash@@ an remained of the remn@@ ant of the Rep@@ ha@@ im ; behold , his bed@@ stead was a bed@@ stead of iron ; is@@ n '@@ t it in Rab@@ ba@@ h of the children of Am@@ mon ? nine cub@@ its was its length , and four cub@@ its its breadth , after the cub@@ it of a man . )
this land we took in possession at that time : from A@@ ro@@ er , which is by the valley of the Ar@@ non , and half the hill country of Gil@@ e@@ ad , and its cities , gave I to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites and to the G@@ ad@@ ites :
J@@ air the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h took all the region of Ar@@ go@@ b , to the border of the G@@ es@@ hur@@ ites and the Ma@@ ac@@ ath@@ ites , and called them , even Bash@@ an , after his own name , Hav@@ vo@@ th J@@ air , to this day . )
the Arab@@ ah also , and the Jordan and its border , from Chin@@ ner@@ eth even to the sea of the Arab@@ ah , the Salt Sea , under the slopes of Pis@@ g@@ ah eastward .
but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was angry with me for your s@@ akes , and did@@ n '@@ t listen to me ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to me , " Let it suffice you ; speak no more to me of this matter .
now , Israel , listen to the statutes and to the ordin@@ ances , which I teach you , to do them ; that you may live , and go in and possess the land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fathers , gives you .
you shall not add to the word which I command you , neither shall you diminish from it , that you may keep the commandments of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God which I command you .
keep therefore and do them ; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples , who shall hear all these statutes , and say , " Su@@ rely this great nation is a wise and understanding people . "
you came near and stood under the mountain ; and the mountain burned with fire to the heart of the sky , with darkness , cloud , and thick darkness .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke to you out of the midst of the fire : you heard the voice of words , but you saw no form ; you only heard a voice .
he declared to you his covenant , which he commanded you to perform , even the ten commandments ; and he wrote them on two tables of stone .
but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has taken you , and brought you forth out of the iron furnace , out of Egypt , to be to him a people of inheritance , as at this day .
furthermore Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was angry with me for your s@@ akes , and s@@ wore that I should not go over the Jordan , and that I should not go in to that good land , which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you for an inheritance :
but I must die in this land , I must not go over the Jordan ; but you shall go over , and possess that good land .
did a people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire , as you have heard , and live ?
out of heaven he made you to hear his voice , that he might instruct you : and on earth he made you to see his great fire ; and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire .
B@@ ez@@ er in the wilderness , in the plain country , for the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites ; and Ram@@ o@@ th in Gil@@ e@@ ad , for the G@@ ad@@ ites ; and Golan in Bash@@ an , for the Man@@ ass@@ ites .
beyond the Jordan , in the valley over against B@@ eth Pe@@ or , in the land of Si@@ hon king of the A@@ mor@@ ites , who lived at H@@ esh@@ bon , whom Moses and the children of Israel struck , when they came forth out of Egypt .
they took his land in possession , and the land of O@@ g king of Bash@@ an , the two kings of the A@@ mor@@ ites , who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise ;
from A@@ ro@@ er , which is on the edge of the valley of the Ar@@ non , even to Mount Si@@ on ( the same is Her@@ mon ) ,
Moses called to all Israel , and said to them , He@@ ar , Israel , the statutes and the ordin@@ ances which I speak in your ears this day , that you may learn them , and observe to do them .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h did@@ n '@@ t make this covenant with our fathers , but with us , even us , who are all of us here alive this day .
( I stood between Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h and you at that time , to show you the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : for you were afraid because of the fire , and did@@ n '@@ t go up onto the mountain ; ) saying ,
" I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bond@@ age .
you shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by an out@@ stretched arm : therefore Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day .
" neither shall you co@@ vet your neighbor 's wife ; neither shall you desire your neighbor 's house , his field , or his male servant , or his female servant , his ox , or his don@@ key , or anything that is your neighbor 's . "
these words Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke to all your assembly on the mountain out of the midst of the fire , of the cloud , and of the thick darkness , with a great voice : and he added no more . he wrote them on two tables of stone , and gave them to me .
for who is there of all flesh , that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire , as we have , and lived ?
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h heard the voice of your words , when you spoke to me ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to me , " I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they have spoken to you : they have well said all that they have spoken .
but as for you , stand here by me , and I will tell you all the commandment , and the statutes , and the ordin@@ ances , which you shall teach them , that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it . "
you shall observe to do therefore as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God has commanded you : you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
you shall walk in all the way which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God has commanded you , that you may live , and that it may be well with you , and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess .
that you might fear Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , to keep all his statutes and his commandments , which I command you , you , and your son , and your son 's son , all the days of your life ; and that your days may be prolonged .
it shall be , when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God shall bring you into the land which he s@@ wore to your fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , to give you , great and goo@@ dly cities , which you did@@ n '@@ t build ,
you shall not go after other gods , of the gods of the peoples who are around you ;
you shall dilig@@ ently keep the commandments of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and his testim@@ onies , and his statutes , which he has commanded you .
you shall do that which is right and good in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; that it may be well with you , and that you may go in and possess the good land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h s@@ wore to your fathers ,
and he brought us out from there , that he might bring us in , to give us the land which he s@@ wore to our fathers .
and when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God shall deliver them up before you , and you shall strike them ; then you shall utterly destroy them : you shall make no covenant with them , nor show mercy to them ;
for he will turn away your son from following me , that they may serve other gods : so the anger of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h would be kind@@ led against you , and he would destroy you quickly .
but you shall deal with them like this : you shall break down their al@@ t@@ ars , and d@@ ash their pillars in pieces , and cut down their Ash@@ eri@@ m , and burn their engra@@ ved images with fire .
for you are a holy people to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God : Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession , above all peoples who are on the face of the earth .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h did@@ n '@@ t set his love on you , nor choose you , because you were more in number than any people ; for you were the fe@@ west of all peoples :
but because Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h loves you , and because he would keep the oath which he s@@ wore to your fathers , has Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h brought you out with a mighty hand , and re@@ deemed you out of the house of bond@@ age , from the hand of Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will take away from you all sickness ; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt , which you know , he will put on you , but will lay them on all those who hate you .
you shall not be scared of them ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God is in the midst of you , a great and awesome God .
he will deliver their kings into your hand , and you shall make their name to perish from under the sky : no man shall be able to stand before you , until you have destroyed them .
you shall burn the engra@@ ved images of their gods with fire . you shall not co@@ vet the silver or the gold that is on them , nor take it for yourself , lest you be sn@@ ared in it ; for it is an ab@@ om@@ ination to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
you shall keep the commandments of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , to walk in his ways , and to fear him .
but you shall remember Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , for it is he who gives you power to get wealth ; that he may establish his covenant which he s@@ wore to your fathers , as at this day .
it shall be , if you shall forget Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and walk after other gods , and serve them , and worship them , I testify against you this day that you shall surely perish .
hear , Israel : you are to pass over the Jordan this day , to go in to dis@@ possess nations greater and mi@@ gh@@ tier than yourself , cities great and fortified up to the sky ,
remember , don '@@ t forget , how you provoked Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God to wrath in the wilderness : from the day that you went forth out of the land of Egypt , until you came to this place , you have been rebelli@@ ous against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
when I was gone up onto the mountain to receive the tables of stone , even the tables of the covenant which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h made with you , then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights ; I neither ate bread nor drank water .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h delivered to me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God ; and on them were all the words which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to me , " A@@ rise , get down quickly from here ; for your people whom you have brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves ; they have quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them ; they have made them a mol@@ ten image . "
let me alone , that I may destroy them , and b@@ lot out their name from under the sky ; and I will make of you a nation mi@@ gh@@ tier and greater than they . "
so I turned and came down from the mountain , and the mountain was burning with fire : and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands .
I looked , and behold , you had sin@@ ned against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God ; you had made yourselves a mol@@ ten cal@@ f : you had turned aside quickly out of the way which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had commanded you .
for I was afraid of the anger and hot dis@@ pleasure , with which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was angry against you to destroy you . but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h listened to me that time also .
when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h sent you from Kad@@ esh Bar@@ ne@@ a , saying , " Go up and possess the land which I have given you " ; then you reb@@ elled against the commandment of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and you did@@ n '@@ t believe him , nor listen to his voice .
I prayed to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and said , " Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , don '@@ t destroy your people and your inheritance , that you have re@@ deemed through your greatness , that you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand .
he wrote on the tables , according to the first writing , the ten commandments , which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly : and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h gave them to me .
( the children of Israel traveled from Be@@ ero@@ th Ben@@ e Ja@@ ak@@ an to Mos@@ er@@ ah . there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Ele@@ az@@ ar his son minist@@ ered in the priest 's office in his place .
at that time Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h set apart the tribe of Lev@@ i , to bear the ark of the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to stand before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to minister to him , and to bless in his name , to this day .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to me , " A@@ rise , take your journey before the people ; and they shall go in and possess the land , which I s@@ wore to their fathers to give to them . "
for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , he is God of gods , and Lord of lords , the great God , the mighty , and the awesome , who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t respect persons , nor takes reward .
you shall fear Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God ; you shall serve him ; and you shall cling to him , and you shall swear by his name .
know this day : for I don '@@ t speak with your children who have not known , and who have not seen the ch@@ as@@ tis@@ ement of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , his greatness , his mighty hand , and his out@@ stretched arm ,
and his signs , and his works , which he did in the midst of Egypt to Phar@@ aoh the king of Egypt , and to all his land ;
therefore you shall keep all the commandment which I command you this day , that you may be strong , and go in and possess the land , where you go over to possess it ;
it shall happen , if you shall listen dilig@@ ently to my commandments which I command you this day , to love Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul ,
and the anger of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h be kind@@ led against you , and he shut up the sky , so that there shall be no rain , and the land shall not yield its fruit ; and you perish quickly from off the good land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h gives you .
you shall teach them your children , talking of them , when you sit in your house , and when you walk by the way , and when you lie down , and when you rise up .
that your days may be multiplied , and the days of your children , in the land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h s@@ wore to your fathers to give them , as the days of the heavens above the earth .
for if you shall dilig@@ ently keep all this commandment which I command you , to do it , to love Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , to walk in all his ways , and to cling to him ;
every place where@@ on the sole of your foot shall t@@ read shall be yours : from the wilderness , and Lebanon , from the river , the river E@@ uph@@ rates , even to the hinder sea shall be your border .
no man shall be able to stand before you : Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God shall lay the fear of you and the dre@@ ad of you on all the land that you shall t@@ read on , as he has spoken to you .
and the curse , if you shall not listen to the commandments of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other gods , which you have not known .
these are the statutes and the ordin@@ ances which you shall observe to do in the land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fathers , has given you to possess it , all the days that you live on the earth .
you shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dis@@ possess served their gods , on the high mountains , and on the hills , and under every green tree :
and you shall break down their al@@ t@@ ars , and d@@ ash in pieces their pillars , and burn their Ash@@ eri@@ m with fire ; and you shall cut down the engra@@ ved images of their gods ; and you shall destroy their name out of that place .
but to the place which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose out of all your tribes , to put his name there , even to his hab@@ itation you shall seek , and there you shall come ;
and there you shall bring your burnt offerings , and your sacrifices , and your ti@@ thes , and the wave offering of your hand , and your v@@ ows , and your fre@@ e@@ will offerings , and the fir@@ st@@ born of your herd and of your flock :
and there you shall eat before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to , you and your households , in which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God has blessed you .
you shall not do after all the things that we do here this day , every man whatever is right in his own eyes ;
but in the place which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall choose in one of your tribes , there you shall offer your burnt offerings , and there you shall do all that I command you .
only you shall not eat the blood ; you shall pour it out on the earth as water .
only be sure that you don '@@ t eat the blood : for the blood is the life ; and you shall not eat the life with the flesh .
and you shall offer your burnt offerings , the flesh and the blood , on the altar of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God ; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God ; and you shall eat the flesh .
observe and hear all these words which I command you , that it may go well with you , and with your children after you forever , when you do that which is good and right in the eyes of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
you shall walk after Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and fear him , and keep his commandments , and obey his voice , and you shall serve him , and cling to him .
but you shall surely kill him ; your hand shall be first on him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
you shall stone him to death with stones , because he has sought to draw you away from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , who brought you out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bond@@ age .
all Israel shall hear , and fear , and shall not do any more such w@@ ick@@ edness as this is in the midst of you .
certain base fellows are gone out from the midst of you , and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city , saying , " Let us go and serve other gods , " which you have not known ;
you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword , destroying it utterly , and all that is therein and its livestock , with the edge of the sword .
nothing of the devoted thing shall cling to your hand ; that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h may turn from the fierc@@ eness of his anger , and show you mercy , and have compassion on you , and multiply you , as he has sworn to your fathers ;
when you shall listen to the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , to keep all his commandments which I command you this day , to do that which is right in the eyes of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
for you are a holy people to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has chosen you to be a people for his own possession , above all peoples who are on the face of the earth .
the hart , and the gaz@@ elle , and the Ro@@ e@@ buck , and the wild goat , and the i@@ be@@ x , and the ant@@ elop@@ e , and the cham@@ ois .
nevertheless these you shall not eat of them that chew the cu@@ d , or of those who have the ho@@ of clo@@ ven : the cam@@ el , and the h@@ are , and the rabbit ; because they chew the cu@@ d but don '@@ t part the ho@@ of , they are un@@ clean to you .
but these are they of which you shall not eat : the eagle , and the vul@@ ture , and the os@@ prey ,
you shall surely ti@@ the all the increase of your seed , that which comes forth from the field year by year .
then you shall turn it into money , and bind up the money in your hand , and shall go to the place which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose :
this is the way of the release : every creditor shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor ; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother ; because Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's release has been proclaimed .
of a foreigner you may exact it : but whatever of your is with your brother your hand shall release .
for the poor will never cease out of the land : therefore I command you , saying , You shall surely open your hand to your brother , to your ne@@ edy , and to your poor , in your land .
if your brother , a Hebrew man , or a Hebrew woman , is sold to you , and serves you six years ; then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you .
you shall fur@@ nish him liber@@ ally out of your flock , and out of your thresh@@ ing floor , and out of your win@@ ep@@ ress ; as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God has blessed you , you shall give to him .
then you shall take an aw@@ l , and thrust it through his ear to the door , and he shall be your servant forever . also to your female servant you shall do likewise .
you shall eat it within your gates : the un@@ clean and the clean shall eat it alike , as the gaz@@ elle , and as the hart .
you shall sacrifice the Pas@@ sover to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , of the flock and the herd , in the place which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall choose , to cause his name to dwell there .
but at the place which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose , to cause his name to dwell in , there you shall sacrifice the Pas@@ sover at evening , at the going down of the sun , at the season that you came forth out of Egypt .
six days you shall eat un@@ leav@@ ened bread . on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God ; you shall do no work .
you shall keep the feast of weeks to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God with a tribute of a fre@@ e@@ will offering of your hand , which you shall give , according as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God bl@@ esses you :
you shall keep the feast of tents seven days , after that you have gathered in from your thresh@@ ing floor and from your win@@ ep@@ ress :
and you shall rejoice in your feast , you , and your son , and your daughter , and your male servant , and your female servant , and the Lev@@ ite , and the foreigner , and the fa@@ ther@@ less , and the widow , who are within your gates .
you shall not plant for yourselves an Ash@@ er@@ ah of any kind of tree beside the altar of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , which you shall make for yourselves .
if there is found in the midst of you , within any of your gates which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , man or woman , who does that which is evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , in Trans@@ gres@@ sing his covenant ,
and has gone and served other gods , and worshi@@ ped them , or the sun , or the moon , or any of the army of the sky , which I have not commanded ;
and it be told you , and you have heard of it , then you shall inqu@@ ire dilig@@ ently ; and behold , if it be true , and the thing certain , that such ab@@ om@@ ination is done in Israel ,
at the mouth of two witnesses , or three witnesses , shall he who is to die be put to death ; at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death .
and you shall come to the priests the Lev@@ ites , and to the judge who shall be in those days : and you shall inqu@@ ire ; and they shall show you the sentence of judgment .
you shall do according to the ten@@ or of the sentence which they shall show you from that place which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall choose ; and you shall observe to do according to all that they shall teach you :
the man who does presu@@ mp@@ tu@@ ously , in not listening to the priest who stands to minister there before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , or to the judge , even that man shall die : and you shall put away the evil from Israel .
you shall surely set him king over yourselves , whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God shall choose : one from among your brothers you shall set king over you ; you may not put a foreigner over you , who is not your brother .
only he shall not multiply horses to himself , nor cause the people to return to Egypt , to the end that he may multiply horses ; because Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has said to you , " You shall not go back that way again . "
and it shall be with him , and he shall read therein all the days of his life ; that he may learn to fear Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God , to keep all the words of this law and these statutes , to do them ;
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God will raise up to you a prophet from the midst of you , of your brothers , like me . you shall listen to him .
this is according to all that you desired of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God in H@@ ore@@ b in the day of the assembly , saying , " Let me not hear again the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I not die . "
it shall happen , that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
but the prophet , who shall speak a word presu@@ mp@@ tu@@ ously in my name , which I have not commanded him to speak , or who shall speak in the name of other gods , that same prophet shall die . "
when a prophet speaks in the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , if the thing do@@ es@@ n '@@ t follow , nor happen , that is the thing which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has not spoken : the prophet has spoken it presu@@ mp@@ tu@@ ously , you shall not be afraid of him .
you shall set apart three cities for you in the midst of your land , which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you to possess it .
you shall prepare you the way , and divide the borders of your land , which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God causes you to inherit , into three parts , that every man@@ s@@ layer may flee there .
but if any man h@@ ates his neighbor , and lies in wait for him , and rises up against him , and strikes him mort@@ ally so that he dies , and he fle@@ es into one of these cities ;
then the elders of his city shall send and bring him there , and deliver him into the hand of the Av@@ enger of blood , that he may die .
you shall not remove your neighbor 's landmark , which they of old time have set , in your inheritance which you shall inherit , in the land that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you to possess it .
then you shall do to him as he had thought to do to his brother : so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you .
those who remain shall hear , and fear , and shall h@@ ence@@ forth commit no more any such evil in the midst of you .
when you go forth to battle against your enemies , and see horses , ch@@ ari@@ ots , and a people more than you , you shall not be afraid of them ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God is with you , who brought you up out of the land of Egypt .
and shall tell them , " He@@ ar , Israel , you draw near this day to battle against your enemies : Don '@@ t let your heart faint ; don '@@ t be afraid , nor trem@@ ble , neither be scared of them ;
for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God is he who goes with you , to fight for you against your enemies , to save you . "
what man is there who has planted a viney@@ ard , and has not used its fruit ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man use its fruit .
what man is there who has pledged to be married a wife , and has not taken her ? let him go and return to his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her . "
it shall be , if it makes you answer of peace , and opens to you , then it shall be , that all the people who are found therein shall become tri@@ but@@ ary to you , and shall serve you .
thus you shall do to all the cities which are very far off from you , which are not of the cities of these nations .
but you shall utterly destroy them : the Hit@@ tite , and the A@@ mor@@ ite , the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , the Hi@@ v@@ ite , and the Je@@ bus@@ ite ; as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God has commanded you ;
then your elders and your judges shall come forth , and they shall measure to the cities which are around him who is sl@@ ain :
and the elders of that city shall bring down the hei@@ fer to a valley with running water , which is neither pl@@ owed nor s@@ own , and shall break the hei@@ fer 's neck there in the valley .
all the elders of that city , who are nearest to the sl@@ ain man , shall wash their hands over the hei@@ fer whose neck was broken in the valley ;
if a man have two wives , the one beloved , and the other hated , and they have borne him children , both the beloved and the hated ; and if the fir@@ st@@ born son be hers who was hated ;
but he shall acknowledge the fir@@ st@@ born , the son of the hated , by giving him a double portion of all that he has ; for he is the beginning of his strength ; the right of the fir@@ st@@ born is his .
if a man have a stubborn and rebelli@@ ous son , who will not obey the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and , though they cha@@ sten him , will not listen to them ;
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out to the elders of his city , and to the gate of his place ;
and they shall tell the elders of his city , " This our son is stubborn and rebelli@@ ous , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glut@@ ton , and a drun@@ k@@ ard . "
all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones : so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you ; and all Israel shall hear , and fear .
if a bird 's nest chance to be before you in the way , in any tree or on the ground , with young ones or eggs , and the hen sitting on the young , or on the eggs , you shall not take the hen with the young :
you shall not sow your viney@@ ard with two kinds of seed , lest the whole fruit be forfe@@ ited , the seed which you have s@@ own , and the increase of the viney@@ ard .
you shall make yourselves fring@@ es on the four borders of your cloak , with which you cover yourself .
and the young lady 's father shall tell the elders , " I gave my daughter to this man to wife , and he h@@ ates her ;
and behold , he has accused her of shameful things , saying , ' I did@@ n '@@ t find in your daughter the tok@@ ens of vir@@ g@@ inity ; ' and yet these are the tok@@ ens of my daughter 's vir@@ g@@ inity . " they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city .
if a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband , then they shall both of them die , the man who lay with the woman , and the woman : so you shall put away the evil from Israel .
but if the man find the lady who is pledged to be married in the field , and the man force her , and lie with her ; then the man only who lay with her shall die :
but to the lady you shall do nothing ; there is in the lady no sin worthy of death : for as when a man rises against his neighbor , and kills him , even so is this matter ;
then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady 's father fifty she@@ k@@ els of silver , and she shall be his wife , because he has hum@@ bled her ; he may not put her away all his days .
he who is wounded in the stones , or has his priv@@ y member cut off , shall not enter into the assembly of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
a b@@ ast@@ ard shall not enter into the assembly of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; even to the tenth generation shall none of his enter into the assembly of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
an Am@@ mon@@ ite or a Mo@@ ab@@ ite shall not enter into the assembly of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; even to the tenth generation shall none belonging to them enter into the assembly of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h forever :
you shall not abh@@ or an E@@ dom@@ ite ; for he is your brother : you shall not abh@@ or an Egyptian , because you lived as a foreigner in his land .
he shall dwell with you , in the midst of you , in the place which he shall choose within one of your gates , where it pleas@@ es him best : you shall not op@@ press him .
there shall be no pro@@ stitute of the daughters of Israel , neither shall there be a so@@ dom@@ ite of the sons of Israel .
you shall not bring the hire of a pro@@ stitute , or the wages of a dog , into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God for any vo@@ w : for even both these are an ab@@ om@@ ination to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
to a foreigner you may lend on interest ; but to your brother you shall not lend on interest , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God may bless you in all that you put your hand to , in the land where you go in to possess it .
when you shall vo@@ w a vo@@ w to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , you shall not be slack to pay it : for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God will surely require it of you ; and it would be sin in you .
that which is gone out of your lips you shall observe and do ; according as you have vowed to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , a fre@@ e@@ will offering , which you have promised with your mouth .
when you come into your neighbor 's viney@@ ard , then you may eat of grapes your fill at your own pleasure ; but you shall not put any in your vessel .
you shall surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goes down , that he may sleep in his garment , and bless you : and it shall be righteousness to you before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
you shall not op@@ press a hired servant who is poor and ne@@ edy , whether he be of your brothers , or of your foreigners who are in your land within your gates :
the fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
you shall not deprive the foreigner , or the fa@@ ther@@ less of justice , nor take a widow 's clothing in pledge ;
but you shall remember that you were a bond@@ servant in Egypt , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God re@@ deemed you there : therefore I command you to do this thing .
when you reap your harvest in your field , and have forgot a she@@ af in the field , you shall not go again to get it : it shall be for the foreigner , for the fa@@ ther@@ less , and for the widow ; that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God may bless you in all the work of your hands .
when you harvest your viney@@ ard , you shall not g@@ lean it after yourselves : it shall be for the foreigner , for the fa@@ ther@@ less , and for the widow .
if there is a controversy between men , and they come to judgment , and the judges judge them ; then they shall justify the righteous , and condemn the wicked ;
it shall be , that the fir@@ st@@ born whom she bears shall succeed in the name of his brother who is dead , that his name not be blo@@ tted out of Israel .
then the elders of his city shall call him , and speak to him : and if he stand , and say , " I don '@@ t want to take her " ;
when men strive together one with another , and the wife of the one draws near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him who strikes him , and puts forth her hand , and takes him by the secrets ;
how he met you by the way , and struck the hind@@ most of you , all who were fee@@ ble behind you , when you were faint and weary ; and he did@@ n '@@ t fear God .
therefore it shall be , when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God has given you rest from all your enemies all around , in the land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it , that you shall b@@ lot out the memory of A@@ mal@@ ek from under the sky ; you shall not forget .
it shall be , when you have come in to the land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you for an inheritance , and possess it , and dwell therein ,
you shall come to the priest who shall be in those days , and tell him , " I prof@@ ess this day to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , that I am come to the land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h s@@ wore to our fathers to give us . "
you shall answer and say before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , " A Syrian ready to perish was my father ; and he went down into Egypt , and lived there , few in number ; and he became there a nation , great , mighty , and populous .
and we cried to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of our fathers , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h heard our voice , and saw our afflic@@ tion , and our to@@ il , and our oppression ;
now , behold , I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground , which you , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have given me . " you shall set it down before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and worship before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
you shall rejoice in all the good which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God has given to you , and to your house , you , and the Lev@@ ite , and the foreigner who is in the midst of you .
you have declared Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h this day to be your God , and that you would walk in his ways , and keep his statutes , and his commandments , and his ordin@@ ances , and listen to his voice :
and to make you high above all nations that he has made , in praise , and in name , and in honor ; and that you may be a holy people to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , as he has spoken .
it shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Jordan to the land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you , that you shall set yourself up great stones , and pl@@ aster them with pl@@ aster :
there you shall build an altar to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , an altar of stones : you shall lift up no iron on them .
you shall build the altar of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God of un@@ cut stones ; and you shall offer burnt offerings there@@ on to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God :
Moses and the priests the Lev@@ ites spoke to all Israel , saying , " Keep silence , and listen , Israel : this day you have become the people of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
you shall therefore obey the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and do his commandments and his statutes , which I command you this day . "
" these shall stand on Mount Ger@@ iz@@ im to bless the people , when you have passed over the Jordan : Sim@@ eon , and Lev@@ i , and Jud@@ ah , and Is@@ sac@@ har , and Joseph , and Benjamin .
'@@ Cur@@ sed is the man who makes an engra@@ ved or mol@@ ten image , an ab@@ om@@ ination to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the work of the hands of the cra@@ fts@@ man , and sets it up in secret . ' all the people shall answer and say , ' A@@ men . '
'@@ Cur@@ sed is he who the foreigner , fa@@ ther@@ less , and widow of justice . ' all the people shall say , ' A@@ men . '
'@@ Cur@@ sed is he who lies with his father 's wife , because he has uncovered his father 's skirt . ' all the people shall say , ' A@@ men . '
'@@ Cur@@ sed is he who lies with his sister , the daughter of his father , or the daughter of his mother . ' all the people shall say , ' A@@ men . '
'@@ Cur@@ sed is he who strikes his neighbor in secret . ' all the people shall say , ' A@@ men . '
'@@ Cur@@ sed is he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t confirm the words of this law to do them . ' all the people shall say , ' A@@ men . ' "
it shall happen , if you shall listen dilig@@ ently to the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , to observe to do all his commandments which I command you this day , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God will set you on high above all the nations of the earth :
you shall be blessed in the fruit of your body , the fruit of your ground , the fruit of your animals , the increase of your livestock , and the young of your flock .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be struck before you . they will come out against you one way , and will flee before you seven ways .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will command the blessing on you in your bar@@ ns , and in all that you put your hand to ; and he will bless you in the land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will establish you for a holy people to himself , as he has sworn to you ; if you shall keep the commandments of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and walk in his ways .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will make you pl@@ ent@@ eous for good , in the fruit of your body , and in the fruit of your livestock , and in the fruit of your ground , in the land which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h s@@ wore to your fathers to give you .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will make you the head , and not the tail ; and you shall be above only , and you shall not be beneath ; if you shall listen to the commandments of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , which I command you this day , to observe and to do ,
and shall not turn aside from any of the words which I command you this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other gods to serve them .
but it shall come to pass , if you will not listen to the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command you this day , that all these cur@@ ses shall come on you , and over@@ take you .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will strike you with consumption , and with fever , and with inflammation , and with fiery heat , and with the sword , and with b@@ light , and with mil@@ de@@ w ; and they shall pursue you until you perish .
you shall bet@@ ro@@ th a wife , and another man shall lie with her : you shall build a house , and you shall not dwell therein : you shall plant a viney@@ ard , and shall not use its fruit .
your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people ; and your eyes shall look , and fail with longing for them all the day : and there shall be nothing in the power of your hand .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will strike you in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore boil , of which you can not be healed , from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head .
you shall become an aston@@ ishment , a prover@@ b , and a by@@ word , among all the peoples where Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall lead you away .
you shall carry much seed out into the field , and shall gather little in ; for the loc@@ ust shall consume it .
you shall have olive trees throughout all your borders , but you shall not ano@@ int yourself with the oil ; for your oli@@ ves shall drop off .
because you did@@ n '@@ t serve Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God with joy@@ fulness , and with gl@@ ad@@ ness of heart , by reason of the abundance of all things ;
therefore you shall serve your enemies whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall send against you , in hunger , and in thirst , and in n@@ ak@@ edness , and in want of all things : and he shall put a y@@ oke of iron on your neck , until he has destroyed you .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will bring a nation against you from far , from the end of the earth , as the eagle flies ; a nation whose language you shall not understand ;
you shall eat the fruit of your own body , the flesh of your sons and of your daughters , whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God has given you , in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies shall distress you .
the man who is tender among you , and very delicate , his eye shall be evil toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bos@@ om , and toward the remn@@ ant of his children whom he has remaining ;
so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat , because he has nothing left him , in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you in all your gates .
if you will not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , that you may fear this glorious and fearful name , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h YOUR GO@@ D ;
he will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt , which you were afraid of ; and they shall cling to you .
also every sickness , and every plague , which is not written in the book of this law , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will bring them on you , until you are destroyed .
you shall be left few in number , whereas you were as the stars of the sky for multitude ; because you did@@ n '@@ t listen to the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
it shall happen that as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h rejo@@ iced over you to do you good , and to multiply you , so Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will rejoice over you to cause you to perish , and to destroy you ; and you shall be pl@@ ucked from off the land where you go in to possess it .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will sc@@ atter you among all peoples , from the one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth ; and there you shall serve other gods , which you have not known , you nor your fathers , even wood and stone .
among these nations you shall find no ease , and there shall be no rest for the sole of your foot : but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will give you there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and p@@ ining of soul ;
these are the words of the covenant which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Mo@@ ab , besides the covenant which he made with them in H@@ ore@@ b .
Moses called to all Israel , and said to them , You have seen all that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Phar@@ aoh , and to all his servants , and to all his land ;
I have led you forty years in the wilderness : your clothes have not grown old on you , and your shoes have not grown old on your feet .
you stand this day all of you before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God ; your heads , your tribes , your elders , and your officers , even all the men of Israel ,
your little ones , your wives , and your foreigner who is in the midst of your camps , from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water ;
( for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt , and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you passed ;
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will set him apart to evil out of all the tribes of Israel , according to all the cur@@ ses of the covenant that is written in this book of the law .
the generation to come , your children who shall rise up after you , and the foreigner who shall come from a far land , shall say , when they see the pl@@ agues of that land , and the sick@@ nesses with which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has made it sick ;
even all the nations shall say , " Why has Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h done thus to this land ? what does the heat of this great anger mean ? "
then men shall say , " Because they for@@ s@@ ook the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fathers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt ,
and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h rooted them out of their land in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation , and cast them into another land , as at this day . "
the secret things belong to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God ; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever , that we may do all the words of this law .
it shall happen , when all these things have come on you , the blessing and the curse , which I have set before you , and you shall call them to mind among all the nations , where Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God has driven you ,
and shall return to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and shall obey his voice according to all that I command you this day , you and your children , with all your heart , and with all your soul ;
that then Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God will turn your cap@@ tivity , and have compassion on you , and will return and gather you from all the peoples , where Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God has scattered you .
if your out@@ casts are in the utter@@ most parts of the heavens , from there will Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gather you , and from there he will bring you back :
and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed , and you shall possess it ; and he will do you good , and multiply you above your fathers .
if you shall obey the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law ; if you turn to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God with all your heart , and with all your soul .
I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day , that I have set before you life and death , the blessing and the curse : therefore choose life , that you may live , you and your seed ;
he said to them , " I am one hundred twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has said to me , ' You shall not go over this Jordan . '
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , he will go over before you ; he will destroy these nations from before you , and you shall dis@@ possess them . Joshua shall go over before you , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken .
be strong and courageous , don '@@ t be afraid , nor be scared of them : for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , he it is who does go with you ; he will not fail you , nor for@@ sake you . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , he it is who does go before you ; he will be with you , he will not fail you , neither for@@ sake you : Don '@@ t be afraid , neither be dis@@ may@@ ed . "
Moses wrote this law , and delivered it to the priests the sons of Lev@@ i , who bore the ark of the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and to all the elders of Israel .
when all Israel has come to appear before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God in the place which he shall choose , you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
assemble the people , the men and the women and the little ones , and your foreigner who is within your gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and observe to do all the words of this law ;
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Moses , " Be@@ hold , your days approach that you must die : call Joshua , and present yourselves in the T@@ ent of Meeting , that I may commission him . " Moses and Joshua went , and presented themselves in the T@@ ent of Meeting .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h appeared in the T@@ ent in a pillar of cloud : and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the T@@ ent .
" now therefore write this song for yourselves , and teach it to the children of Israel : put it in their mouths , that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel .
that Moses commanded the Lev@@ ites , who bore the ark of the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , saying ,
assemble to me all the elders of your tribes , and your officers , that I may speak these words in their ears , and call heaven and earth to witness against them .
my doctrine shall drop as the rain . my speech shall conden@@ se as the de@@ w , as the small rain on the tender grass , as the showers on the her@@ b .
they have dealt corrup@@ tly with him . they are not his children , because of their defect . they are a perverse and cro@@ oked generation .
as an eagle that stir@@ s up her nest , that fl@@ ut@@ ters over her young , he spread abroad his wings , he took them , he bore them on his fe@@ athers .
but Jes@@ hur@@ un grew fat , and kicked . you have grown fat . you have grown thick . you have become sle@@ ek . then he for@@ s@@ ook God who made him , and lightly este@@ em@@ ed the Rock of his salvation .
he said , " I will hide my face from them . I will see what their end shall be ; for they are a very perverse generation , children in whom is no faith@@ fulness .
for a fire is kind@@ led in my anger , Bur@@ ns to the lowest She@@ ol , dev@@ ours the earth with its increase , and sets the foundations of the mountains on fire .
were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy , lest their adversaries should judge wrong@@ ly , lest they should say , ' Our hand is exalted , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has not done all this . ' "
for their vine is of the vine of So@@ dom , of the fields of Gom@@ or@@ rah . their grapes are grapes of g@@ all , Their clusters are bitter .
which ate the fat of their sacrifices , And drank the wine of their drink offering ? let them rise up and help you ! let them be your protection .
" see now that I , even I , am he , There is no god with me . I kill , and I make alive . I wound , and I heal . there is no one who can deliver out of my hand .
if I wh@@ et my glit@@ tering sword , My hand take hold on judgment ; I will render vengeance to my adversaries , and will re@@ comp@@ ense those who hate me .
rejoice , you nations , with his people , for he will av@@ enge the blood of his servants . he will render vengeance to his adversaries , And will make ex@@ pi@@ ation for his land , for his people .
he said to them , " Set your heart to all the words which I testify to you this day , which you shall command your children to observe to do , all the words of this law .
" go up into this mountain of Ab@@ ari@@ m , to Mount Ne@@ bo , which is in the land of Mo@@ ab , that is over against Jer@@ ich@@ o ; and see the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which I give to the children of Israel for a possession ;
because you t@@ resp@@ assed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of M@@ eri@@ ba@@ h of Kad@@ esh , in the wilderness of Z@@ in ; because you did@@ n '@@ t sancti@@ fy me in the midst of the children of Israel .
for you shall see the land before you ; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the children of Israel . "
he was king in Jes@@ hur@@ un , When the heads of the people were gathered , All the tribes of Israel together .
this is for Jud@@ ah . he said , " He@@ ar , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the voice of Jud@@ ah . bring him in to his people . with his hands he cont@@ ended for himself . you shall be a help against his adversaries . "
they shall teach Jacob your ordin@@ ances , and Israel your law . they shall put inc@@ ense before you , and whole burnt offering on your altar .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , bless his substance . accept the work of his hands . strike through the hips of those who rise up against him , of those who hate him , that they not rise again . "
of Benjamin he said , " The beloved of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall dwell in safety by him . he covers him all the day long . he d@@ wells between his shoulders . "
of N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i he said , " N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i , satisfied with favor , full of the blessing of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , possess the west and the south . "
of Ash@@ er he said , " Ash@@ er is blessed with children . let him be acceptable to his brothers . let him dip his foot in oil .
" there is none like God , Jes@@ hur@@ un , who rides on the heavens for your help , In his excell@@ ency on the skies .
the eternal God is your dwelling place . underneath are the everlasting arms . he thrust out the enemy from before you , and said , ' D@@ estro@@ y ! '
you are happy , Israel . who is like you , a people saved by Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the shield of your help , the sword of your excell@@ ency ! your enemies shall submit themselves to you . you shall t@@ read on their high places . "
Moses went up from the plains of Mo@@ ab to Mount Ne@@ bo , to the top of Pis@@ g@@ ah , that is over against Jer@@ ich@@ o . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h showed him all the land of Gil@@ e@@ ad , to Dan ,
and the South , and the Pl@@ ain of the valley of Jer@@ ich@@ o the city of palm trees , to Zo@@ ar .
so Moses the servant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h died there in the land of Mo@@ ab , according to the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
the children of Israel we@@ pt for Moses in the plains of Mo@@ ab thirty days : so the days of we@@ eping in the mourning for Moses were ended .
in all the signs and the wonders , which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h sent him to do in the land of Egypt , to Phar@@ aoh , and to all his servants , and to all his land ,
and in all the mighty hand , and in all the great terror , which Moses worked in the sight of all Israel .
" Moses my servant is dead ; now therefore arise , go over this Jordan , you , and all this people , to the land which I give to them , even to the children of Israel .
no man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life . as I was with Moses , so I will be with you . I will not fail you nor for@@ sake you .
" remember the word which Moses the servant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h commanded you , saying , ' Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God gives you rest , and will give you this land .
your wives , your little ones , and your livestock , shall live in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan ; but you shall pass over before your brothers armed , all the mighty men of val@@ or , and shall help them
whoever rebels against your commandment , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t listen to your words in all that you command him , he shall be put to death . only be strong and courageous . "
Joshua the son of N@@ un secretly sent two men out of sh@@ it@@ tim as spies , saying , " Go , view the land , including Jer@@ ich@@ o . " they went and came into the house of a pro@@ stitute whose name was Ra@@ hab , and slept there .
the woman took the two men and hid them . then she said , " Yes , the men came to me , but I did@@ n '@@ t know where they came from .
and she said to the men , " I know that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has given you the land , and that the fear of you has fallen on us , and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you .
for we have heard how Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h dried up the water of the Red Sea before you , when you came out of Egypt ; and what you did to the two kings of the A@@ mor@@ ites , who were beyond the Jordan , to Si@@ hon and to O@@ g , whom you utterly destroyed .
as soon as we had heard it , our hearts melted , neither did there remain any more spirit in any man , because of you : for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , he is God in heaven above , and on earth beneath .
now therefore , please swear to me by Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , since I have dealt kindly with you , that you also will deal kindly with my father 's house , and give me a true token ;
then she let them down by a cord through the window ; for her house was on the side of the wall , and she lived on the wall .
she said to them , " Go to the mountain , lest the pursu@@ ers find you ; and hide yourselves there three days , until the pursu@@ ers have returned . afterward , you may go your way . "
they went , and came to the mountain , and stayed there three days , until the pursu@@ ers had returned . the pursu@@ ers sought them throughout all the way , but did@@ n '@@ t find them .
they said to Joshua , " Tru@@ ly Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has delivered into our hands all the land . moreover , all the inhabitants of the land melt away before us . "
Joshua said to the children of Israel , " Come here , and hear the words of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God . "
Joshua said , " Her@@ e@@ by you shall know that the living God is among you , and that he will without fail drive the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , and the Hit@@ tite , and the Hi@@ v@@ ite , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , and the Gir@@ g@@ ash@@ ite , and the A@@ mor@@ ite , and the Je@@ bus@@ ite out from before you .
it happened , when the people moved from their tents to pass over the Jordan , the priests who bore the ark of the covenant being before the people ,
then Joshua called the twelve men , whom he had prepared of the children of Israel , out of every tribe a man .
Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan , in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood ; and they are there to this day .
for the priests who bore the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan , until everything was finished that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h commanded Joshua to speak to the people , according to all that Moses commanded Joshua ; and the people hur@@ ried and passed over .
about forty thousand men , ready and armed for war passed over before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to battle , to the plains of Jer@@ ich@@ o .
on that day , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h magni@@ fied Joshua in the sight of all Israel ; and they feared him , as they feared Moses , all the days of his life .
the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and enc@@ amped in Gil@@ gal , on the east border of Jer@@ ich@@ o .
he spoke to the children of Israel , saying , " When your children ask their fathers in time to come , saying , ' What do these stones mean ? '
then you shall let your children know , saying , ' Israel came over this Jordan on dry land .
for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you , until you had passed over , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God did to the Red Sea , which he dried up from before us , until we had passed over ;
that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that it is mighty ; that you may fear Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God forever . ' "
at that time , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Joshua , " Make fl@@ int kni@@ ves , and circum@@ c@@ ise again the children of Israel the second time . "
this is the reason Joshua circum@@ c@@ ised : all the people who came out of Egypt , who were males , even all the men of war , died in the wilderness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
for all the people who came out were circum@@ c@@ ised ; but all the people who were born in the wilderness by the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circum@@ c@@ ised .
their children , whom he raised up in their place , were circum@@ c@@ ised by Joshua ; for they were un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , because they had not circum@@ c@@ ised them on the way .
it happened , when they were done circum@@ c@@ ising all the nation , that they stayed in their places in the camp until they were healed .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Joshua , " Today I have rolled away the repro@@ ach of Egypt from off you . " therefore the name of that place was called Gil@@ gal , to this day .
the children of Israel enc@@ amped in Gil@@ gal . they kept the Pas@@ sover on the four@@ teenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jer@@ ich@@ o .
they ate un@@ leav@@ ened cakes and par@@ ched grain of the produce of the land on the next day after the Pas@@ sover , in the same day .
the man@@ na ceased on the next day , after they had eaten of the produce of the land . the children of Israel did@@ n '@@ t have man@@ na any more ; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Can@@ a@@ an that year .
he said , " No ; but I have come now as commander of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's army . " Joshua fell on his face to the earth , and wor@@ shipped , and said to him , " What does my lord say to his servant ? "
the prince of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's army said to Joshua , " Take your shoes off of your feet ; for the place on which you stand is holy . " Joshua did so .
Joshua the son of N@@ un called the priests , and said to them , " Take up the ark of the covenant , and let seven priests bear seven trum@@ pets of r@@ ams ' horns before the ark of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
it was so , that when Joshua had spoken to the people , the seven priests bearing the seven trum@@ pets of r@@ ams ' horns before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h advanced , and blew the trum@@ pets ; and the ark of the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h followed them .
it happened on the seventh day , that they rose early at the d@@ aw@@ ning of the day , and marched around the city in the same way seven times . only on this day they marched around the city seven times .
it happened at the seventh time , when the priests blew the trum@@ pets , Joshua said to the people , " Sh@@ out , for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has given you the city !
they burnt the city with fire , and all that was in it . only they put the silver , the gold , and the vessels of brass and of iron into the treasury of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's house .
but the children of Israel committed a t@@ resp@@ ass in the devoted things ; for Ach@@ an , the son of C@@ arm@@ i , the son of Zab@@ di , the son of Zer@@ ah , of the tribe of Jud@@ ah , took some of the devoted things . therefore Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's anger burned against the children of Israel .
the men of A@@ i struck about thirty @@@ -@@ @ six men of them , and they ch@@ ased them from before the gate even to She@@ b@@ ari@@ m , and struck them at the descent . the hearts of the people melted , and became like water .
Joshua t@@ ore his clothes , and fell to the earth on his face before the ark of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h until the evening , he and the elders of Israel ; and they put dust on their heads .
therefore the children of Israel can '@@ t stand before their enemies . they turn their backs before their enemies , because they have become devoted for destruction . I will not be with you any more , unless you destroy the devoted things from among you .
he brought near the family of Jud@@ ah ; and he selected the family of the Zer@@ ah@@ ites . he brought near the family of the Zer@@ ah@@ ites man by man , and Zab@@ di was selected .
he brought near his household man by man , and Ach@@ an , the son of C@@ arm@@ i , the son of Zab@@ di , the son of Zer@@ ah , of the tribe of Jud@@ ah , was selected .
Joshua said to Ach@@ an , " My son , please give glory to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , and make confession to him . tell me now what you have done ! Don '@@ t hide it from me ! "
Ach@@ an answered Joshua , and said , " I have truly sin@@ ned against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , and this is what I have done .
they raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h turned from the fierc@@ eness of his anger . therefore the name of that place was called " The valley of Ach@@ or " to this day .
you shall do to A@@ i and her king as you did to Jer@@ ich@@ o and her king , except its spoil and its livestock , you shall take for a pl@@ under for yourselves . set an amb@@ ush for the city behind it . "
so Joshua arose , and all the people of war , to go up to A@@ i . Joshua chose thirty thousand men , the mighty men of val@@ or , and sent them out by night .
he commanded them , saying , " Be@@ hold , you shall lie in amb@@ ush against the city , behind the city . Don '@@ t go very far from the city , but all of you be ready .
I , and all the people who are with me , will approach to the city . it shall happen , when they come out against us , as at the first , that we will flee before them .
they will come out after us , until we have drawn them away from the city ; for they will say , ' They flee before us , like the first time . ' so we will flee before them ,
and you shall rise up from the amb@@ ush , and take possession of the city ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God will deliver it into your hand .
so they set the people , even all the army who was on the north of the city , and their amb@@ ush on the west of the city ; and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley .
the amb@@ ush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand , and entered into the city , and took it . they hur@@ ried and set the city on fire .
when Joshua and all Israel saw that the amb@@ ush had taken the city , and that the smoke of the city asc@@ ended , then they turned again , and killed the men of A@@ i .
all that fell that day , both of men and women , were twelve thousand , even all the men of A@@ i .
for Joshua did@@ n '@@ t draw back his hand , with which he stretched out the javelin , until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of A@@ i .
only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took for prey to themselves , according to the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h which he commanded Joshua .
as Moses the servant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h commanded the children of Israel , as it is written in the book of the law of Moses , an altar of un@@ cut stones , on which no man had lifted up any iron . they offered burnt offerings on it to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and sacrificed peace offerings .
he wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses , which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel .
they also resorted to a r@@ use , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old s@@ acks on their don@@ keys , and win@@ es@@ kins , old and torn and bound up ,
they went to Joshua to the camp at Gil@@ gal , and said to him , and to the men of Israel , " We have come from a far country . now therefore make a covenant with us . "
the men of Israel said to the Hi@@ v@@ ites , " What if you live among us . how could we make a covenant with you ? "
they said to him , " Your servants have come from a very far country because of the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God ; for we have heard of his fame , all that he did in Egypt ,
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we went out to go to you ; but now , behold , it is dry , and has become mol@@ dy .
these win@@ es@@ kins , which we filled , were new ; and behold , they are torn . these our garments and our shoes have become old because of the very long journey . "
it happened at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them , that they heard that they were their neighbors , and that they lived among them .
the children of Israel did@@ n '@@ t strike them , because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel . all the congregation mur@@ mu@@ red against the princes .
Joshua called for them , and he spoke to them , saying , " Why have you deceived us , saying , ' We are very far from you , ' when you live among us ?
now therefore you are cur@@ sed , and some of you will never fail to be bond@@ servants , both wood cut@@ ters and draw@@ ers of water for the house of my God . "
he did so to them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel , so that they did@@ n '@@ t kill them .
that they were very afraid , because Gi@@ be@@ on was a great city , as one of the royal cities , and because it was greater than A@@ i , and all its men were mighty .
" come up to me , and help me , and let us strike Gi@@ be@@ on ; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel . "
that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Mak@@ k@@ ed@@ ah in peace . none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel .
Joshua said to them , " Don '@@ t be afraid , nor be dis@@ may@@ ed . be strong and courageous , for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will do this to all your enemies against whom you fight . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h delivered L@@ ach@@ ish into the hand of Israel . he took it on the second day , and struck it with the edge of the sword , with all the souls who were in it , according to all that he had done to Lib@@ n@@ ah .
they took it on that day , and struck it with the edge of the sword . he utterly destroyed all the souls who were in it that day , according to all that he had done to L@@ ach@@ ish .
it happened , when Jab@@ in king of Haz@@ or heard of it , that he sent to J@@ ob@@ ab king of Mad@@ on , to the king of Shim@@ ron , to the king of Ach@@ shap@@ h ,
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Joshua , " Don '@@ t be afraid because of them ; for tomorrow at this time , I will deliver them up all sl@@ ain before Israel . you shall ham@@ string their horses and burn their ch@@ ari@@ ots with fire . "
Joshua turned back at that time , and took Haz@@ or , and struck its king with the sword : for Haz@@ or used to be the head of all those king@@ doms .
they struck all the souls who were in it with the edge of the sword , utterly destroying them . there was no one left who breath@@ ed . he burnt Haz@@ or with fire .
Joshua captured all the cities of those kings , with their kings , and he struck them with the edge of the sword , and utterly destroyed them ; as Moses the servant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h commanded .
so Joshua captured all that land , the hill country , all the South , all the land of Gos@@ hen , the low@@ land , the Arab@@ ah , the hill country of Israel , and the low@@ land of the same ;
from Mount Hal@@ ak , that goes up to Se@@ ir , even to Ba@@ al G@@ ad in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Her@@ mon . he took all their kings , struck them , and put them to death .
there was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel , except the Hi@@ v@@ ites , the inhabitants of Gi@@ be@@ on . they took all in battle .
Joshua came at that time , and cut off the An@@ ak@@ im from the hill country , from He@@ br@@ on , from Deb@@ ir , from An@@ ab , and from all the hill country of Jud@@ ah , and from all the hill country of Israel : Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities .
there were none of the An@@ ak@@ im left in the land of the children of Israel . only in Gaza , in G@@ ath , and in Ash@@ do@@ d , did some remain .
so Joshua took the whole land , according to all that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke to Moses ; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes . the land had rest from war .
now these are the kings of the land , whom the children of Israel struck , and possessed their land beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise , from the valley of the Ar@@ non to Mount Her@@ mon , and all the Arab@@ ah eastward :
and the border of O@@ g king of Bash@@ an , of the remn@@ ant of the Rep@@ ha@@ im , who lived at Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th and at E@@ dre@@ i ,
and ruled in Mount Her@@ mon , and in Sal@@ ec@@ ah , and in all Bash@@ an , to the border of the G@@ es@@ hur@@ ites and the Ma@@ ac@@ ath@@ ites , and half Gil@@ e@@ ad , the border of Si@@ hon king of H@@ esh@@ bon .
Moses the servant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h and the children of Israel struck them . Moses the servant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h gave it for a possession to the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites , and the G@@ ad@@ ites , and the half @@@ -@@ @ tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
in the hill country , and in the low@@ land , and in the Arab@@ ah , and in the slopes , and in the wilderness , and in the South ; the Hit@@ tite , the A@@ mor@@ ite , and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , the Hi@@ v@@ ite , and the Je@@ bus@@ ite :
the king of D@@ or in the height of D@@ or , one ; the king of Go@@ i@@ im in Gil@@ gal , one ;
all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Mis@@ re@@ pho@@ th M@@ aim , even all the Sid@@ onians ; them will I drive out from before the children of Israel : only allocate it to Israel for an inheritance , as I have commanded you .
and all the cities of Si@@ hon king of the A@@ mor@@ ites , who re@@ igned in H@@ esh@@ bon , to the border of the children of Am@@ mon ;
nevertheless the children of Israel did@@ n '@@ t drive out the G@@ es@@ hur@@ ites , nor the Ma@@ ac@@ ath@@ ites : but G@@ es@@ hu@@ r and Ma@@ ac@@ ath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day .
their border was J@@ az@@ er , and all the cities of Gil@@ e@@ ad , and half the land of the children of Am@@ mon , to A@@ ro@@ er that is before Rab@@ ba@@ h ;
and in the valley , B@@ eth Har@@ am , B@@ eth N@@ im@@ rah , S@@ uc@@ co@@ th , and Z@@ aph@@ on , the rest of the kingdom of Si@@ hon king of H@@ esh@@ bon , the Jordan 's bank , to the utter@@ most part of the sea of Chin@@ ner@@ eth beyond the Jordan eastward .
their border was from Ma@@ han@@ aim , all Bash@@ an , all the kingdom of O@@ g king of Bash@@ an , and all the towns of J@@ air , which are in Bash@@ an , sixty cities .
these are the inher@@ it@@ ances which Moses distributed in the plains of Mo@@ ab , beyond the Jordan at Jer@@ ich@@ o , eastward .
but to the tribe of Lev@@ i Moses gave no inheritance . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , is their inheritance , as he spoke to them .
by the lot of their inheritance , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h commanded by Moses , for the nine tribes , and for the half @@@ -@@ @ tribe .
for Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half @@@ -@@ @ tribe beyond the Jordan ; but to the Lev@@ ites he gave no inheritance among them .
the lot for the tribe of the children of Jud@@ ah according to their families was to the border of E@@ dom , even to the wilderness of Z@@ in sou@@ th@@ ward , at the utter@@ most part of the south .
and it went out sou@@ th@@ ward of the ascent of Ak@@ rab@@ bi@@ m , and passed along to Z@@ in , and went up by the south of Kad@@ esh Bar@@ ne@@ a , and passed along by Hez@@ ron , went up to Ad@@ dar , and turned about to Kar@@ ka ;
and it passed along to Az@@ mon , went out at the bro@@ ok of Egypt ; and the border ended at the sea . this shall be your south border .
the east border was the Salt Sea , even to the end of the Jordan . the border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the end of the Jordan .
the border extended from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of N@@ eph@@ to@@ ah , and went out to the cities of Mount E@@ ph@@ ron ; and the border extended to Ba@@ al@@ ah ( the same is Kiri@@ ath j@@ ear@@ im ) ;
and the border turned about from Ba@@ al@@ ah w@@ est@@ ward to Mount Se@@ ir , and passed along to the side of Mount j@@ ear@@ im on the north ( the same is Ch@@ es@@ al@@ on ) , and went down to B@@ eth Sh@@ em@@ esh , and passed along by Tim@@ n@@ ah ;
and the border went out to the side of Ek@@ ron nor@@ th@@ ward ; and the border extended to Shi@@ k@@ ker@@ on , and passed along to Mount Ba@@ al@@ ah , and went out at Jab@@ ne@@ el ; and the go@@ ings out of the border were at the sea .
it happened , when she came , that she had him ask her father fore a field . she got off of her don@@ key , and Cal@@ eb said , " What do you want ? "
she said , " Gi@@ ve me a blessing . because you have set me in the land of the South , give me also springs of water . " he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs .
the far@@ th@@ est cities of the tribe of the children of Jud@@ ah toward the border of E@@ dom in the South were Kab@@ ze@@ el , E@@ der , Jag@@ ur ,
as for the Je@@ bus@@ ites , the inhabitants of Jerusalem , the children of Jud@@ ah cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t drive them out ; but the Je@@ bus@@ ites live with the children of Jud@@ ah at Jerusalem to this day .
the lot came out for the children of Joseph from the Jordan at Jer@@ ich@@ o , at the waters of Jer@@ ich@@ o on the east , even the wilderness , going up from Jer@@ ich@@ o through the hill country to Be@@ the@@ l .
and it went down w@@ est@@ ward to the border of the Jap@@ h@@ le@@ ti@@ tes , to the border of B@@ eth Hor@@ on the lower , even to Ge@@ zer ; and ended at the sea .
this was the border of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im according to their families . the border of their inheritance eastward was A@@ tar@@ o@@ th Ad@@ dar , to B@@ eth Hor@@ on the upper .
the border went out w@@ est@@ ward at Mic@@ h@@ meth@@ ath on the north . the border turned about eastward to Ta@@ an@@ ath Sh@@ il@@ oh , and passed along it on the east of J@@ ano@@ ah .
it went down from J@@ ano@@ ah to A@@ tar@@ o@@ th , to Na@@ ar@@ ah , reached to Jer@@ ich@@ o , and went out at the Jordan .
from T@@ ap@@ pu@@ ah the border went along w@@ est@@ ward to the bro@@ ok of Kan@@ ah ; and ended at the sea . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im according to their families ;
they did@@ n '@@ t drive out the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites who lived in Ge@@ zer ; but the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites dwell in the midst of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to this day , and have become servants to do forced labor .
this was the lot for the tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , for he was the fir@@ st@@ born of Joseph . as for Mach@@ ir the fir@@ st@@ born of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , the father of Gil@@ e@@ ad , because he was a man of war , therefore he had Gil@@ e@@ ad and Bash@@ an .
but Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had , the son of H@@ ep@@ her , the son of Gil@@ e@@ ad , the son of Mach@@ ir , the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , had no sons , but daughters : and these are the names of his daughters : Mah@@ lah , Noah , H@@ og@@ lah , Mil@@ ca@@ h , and Tir@@ z@@ ah .
they came near before Ele@@ az@@ ar the priest , and before Joshua the son of N@@ un , and before the princes , saying , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers . " therefore according to the commandment of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father .
the border of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was from Ash@@ er to Mic@@ h@@ meth@@ ath , which is before Sh@@ ec@@ hem . the border went along to the right hand , to the inhabitants of E@@ n T@@ ap@@ pu@@ ah .
the land of T@@ ap@@ pu@@ ah belonged to Man@@ as@@ se@@ h ; but T@@ ap@@ pu@@ ah on the border of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h belonged to the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
the border went down to the bro@@ ok of Kan@@ ah , sou@@ th@@ ward of the bro@@ ok . these cities belonged to E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im among the cities of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h . the border of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was on the north side of the bro@@ ok , and ended at the sea .
yet the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t drive out the inhabitants of those cities ; but the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites would dwell in that land .
it happened , when the children of Israel had grown strong , that they put the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites to forced labor , and did@@ n '@@ t utterly drive them out .
the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua , saying , " Why have you given me just one lot and one part for an inheritance , since I am a great people , because Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has blessed me so far ? "
Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph , even to E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and to Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , saying , " You are a great people , and have great power . you shall not have one lot only ;
Joshua said to the children of Israel , " How long will you neglect to go in to possess the land , which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fathers , has given you ?
they shall divide it into seven portions . Jud@@ ah shall live in his borders on the south , and the house of Joseph shall live in their borders on the north .
you shall survey the land into seven parts , and bring the description here to me ; and I will cast lots for you here before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God .
for the Lev@@ ites have no portion among you ; for the priesthood of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is their inheritance . G@@ ad , Re@@ ub@@ en , and the half @@@ -@@ @ tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward , which Moses the servant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h gave them . "
the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families . the border of their lot went out between the children of Jud@@ ah and the children of Joseph .
their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan . the border went up to the side of Jer@@ ich@@ o on the north , and went up through the hill country w@@ est@@ ward . it ended at the wilderness of B@@ eth A@@ ven .
the border passed along from there to Lu@@ z , to the side of Lu@@ z ( the same is Be@@ the@@ l ) , sou@@ th@@ ward . the border went down to A@@ tar@@ o@@ th Ad@@ dar , by the mountain that lies on the south of B@@ eth Hor@@ on the lower .
the border extended , and turned around on the west quarter sou@@ th@@ ward , from the mountain that lies before B@@ eth Hor@@ on sou@@ th@@ ward ; and ended at Kiri@@ ath Ba@@ al ( the same is Kiri@@ ath j@@ ear@@ im ) , a city of the children of Jud@@ ah . this was the west quarter .
it extended nor@@ th@@ ward , went out at E@@ n Sh@@ em@@ esh , and went out to Gel@@ il@@ o@@ th , which is over against the ascent of Ad@@ um@@ mi@@ m . it went down to the stone of Bo@@ han the son of Re@@ ub@@ en .
Zel@@ ah , Ele@@ ph , the Je@@ bus@@ ite ( the same is Jerusalem ) , Gi@@ be@@ ath , and Kiri@@ ath ; fourteen cities with their villages . this is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families .
and all the villages that were around these cities to Ba@@ al@@ ath Be@@ er , Ram@@ ah of the South . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Sim@@ eon according to their families .
out of the part of the children of Jud@@ ah was the inheritance of the children of Sim@@ eon ; for the portion of the children of Jud@@ ah was too much for them . therefore the children of Sim@@ eon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance .
the third lot came up for the children of Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n according to their families . the border of their inheritance was to S@@ arid .
their border went up w@@ est@@ ward , even to Mar@@ al@@ ah , and reached to D@@ ab@@ b@@ esh@@ eth . it reached to the bro@@ ok that is before Jo@@ kne@@ am .
the border turned around it on the north to Hann@@ athon ; and it ended at the valley of I@@ ph@@ tah El ;
the border turned to Ram@@ ah , to the fortified city of Ty@@ re ; and the border turned to Hos@@ ah . it ended at the sea by the region of Ach@@ zi@@ b ;
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ash@@ er according to their families , these cities with their villages .
the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families , these cities with their villages .
according to the commandment of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , they gave him the city which he asked , even Tim@@ n@@ ath@@ ser@@ ah in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; and he built the city , and lived there .
they set apart K@@ ed@@ esh in Gal@@ ilee in the hill country of N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i , Sh@@ ec@@ hem in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and Kiri@@ ath Ar@@ ba ( the same is He@@ br@@ on ) in the hill country of Jud@@ ah .
the children of Israel gave to the Lev@@ ites out of their inheritance , according to the commandment of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , these cities with their suburbs .
the rest of the children of Ko@@ hath had ten cities by lot out of the families of the tribe of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , out of the tribe of Dan , and out of the half @@@ -@@ @ tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
the children of Ger@@ sh@@ on had thirteen cities by lot out of the families of the tribe of Is@@ sac@@ har , out of the tribe of Ash@@ er , out of the tribe of N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i , and out of the half @@@ -@@ @ tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in Bash@@ an .
the children of Mer@@ ari according to their families had twelve cities out of the tribe of Re@@ ub@@ en , out of the tribe of G@@ ad , and out of the tribe of Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n .
but they gave the fields of the city and its villages to Cal@@ eb the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h for his possession .
to the children of Aaron the priest they gave He@@ br@@ on with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the man@@ s@@ layer , Lib@@ n@@ ah with its suburbs ,
all the cities of the children of Aaron , the priests , were thirteen cities with their suburbs .
they gave them Sh@@ ec@@ hem with its suburbs in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , the city of refuge for the man@@ s@@ layer , and Ge@@ zer with its suburbs ,
they gave to the children of Ger@@ sh@@ on , of the families of the Lev@@ ites , out of the half @@@ -@@ @ tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h Golan in Bash@@ an with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the man@@ s@@ layer , and Be E@@ sh@@ ter@@ ah with its suburbs ; two cities .
out of the tribe of N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i , K@@ ed@@ esh in Gal@@ ilee with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the man@@ s@@ layer , Ham@@ mo@@ th@@ d@@ or with its suburbs , and K@@ art@@ an with its suburbs ; three cities .
to the families of the children of Mer@@ ari , the rest of the Lev@@ ites , out of the tribe of Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n , Jo@@ kne@@ am with its suburbs , Kar@@ tah with its suburbs ,
out of the tribe of G@@ ad , Ram@@ o@@ th in Gil@@ e@@ ad with its suburbs , the city of refuge for the man@@ s@@ layer , and Ma@@ han@@ aim with its suburbs ,
and said to them , " You have kept all that Moses the servant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h commanded you , and have listened to my voice in all that I commanded you .
now Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God has given rest to your brothers , as he spoke to them . therefore now return and go to your tents , to the land of your possession , which Moses the servant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h gave you beyond the Jordan .
now to the one half @@@ -@@ @ tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h Moses had given inheritance in Bash@@ an ; but to the other half gave Joshua among their brothers beyond the Jordan w@@ est@@ ward . moreover when Joshua sent them away to their tents , he blessed them ,
when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Sh@@ il@@ oh , to go up against them to war .
is the ini@@ qu@@ ity of Pe@@ or too little for us , from which we have not cleans@@ ed ourselves to this day , although there came a plague on the congregation of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ,
did@@ n '@@ t Ach@@ an the son of Zer@@ ah commit a t@@ resp@@ ass in the devoted thing , and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel ? that man did@@ n '@@ t perish alone in his ini@@ qu@@ ity . ' "
" the Mi@@ ghty One , God , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the Mi@@ ghty One , God , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , he knows ; and Israel shall know : if it was in rebellion , or if in t@@ resp@@ ass against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ( don '@@ t save us this day ) ,
for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has made the Jordan a border between us and you , you children of Re@@ ub@@ en and children of G@@ ad . you have no portion in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . " ' so your children might make our children cease from fearing Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
" far be it from us that we should rebel against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and turn away this day from following Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to build an altar for burnt offering , for meal offering , or for sacrifice , besides the altar of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God that is before his tab@@ ern@@ acle ! "
the thing pleased the children of Israel ; and the children of Israel blessed God , and spoke no more of going up against them to war , to destroy the land in which the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad lived .
that Joshua called for all Israel , for their elders and for their heads , and for their judges and for their officers , and said to them , " I am old and well advanced in years .
behold , I have allo@@ tted to you these nations that remain , to be an inheritance for your tribes , from the Jordan , with all the nations that I have cut off , even to the great sea toward the going down of the sun .
that you not come among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow down yourselves to them ;
one man of you shall chase a thousand ; for it is Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God who fights for you , as he spoke to you .
" but if you do at all go back , and hold fast to the remn@@ ant of these nations , even these who remain among you , and make marriages with them , and go in to them , and they to you ;
Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and called for the elders of Israel , for their heads , for their judges , and for their officers ; and they presented themselves before God .
Joshua said to all the people , " Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , ' Your fathers lived of old time beyond the River , even Ter@@ ah , the father of Abraham , and the father of N@@ ah@@ or : and they served other gods .
I gave to Isaac Jacob and Es@@ au : and I gave to Es@@ au Mount Se@@ ir , to possess it . Jacob and his children went down into Egypt .
" ' I sent Moses and Aaron , and I plagued Egypt , according to that which I did in its midst : and afterward I brought you out .
I sent the hor@@ net before you , which drove them out from before you , even the two kings of the A@@ mor@@ ites ; not with your sword , nor with your bow .
" now therefore fear Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and serve him in sincerity and in truth . put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River , in Egypt ; and serve Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h drove out from before us all the peoples , even the A@@ mor@@ ites who lived in the land . therefore we also will serve Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; for he is our God . "
Joshua said to the people , " You can '@@ t serve Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; for he is a holy God . he is a jeal@@ ous God . he will not forgive your disobedience nor your sins .
Joshua said to the people , " You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h yourselves , to serve him . " they said , " We are witnesses . "
Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God ; and he took a great stone , and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
Joshua said to all the people , " Be@@ hold , this stone shall be a witness against us ; for it has heard all the words of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h which he spoke to us . it shall be therefore a witness against you , lest you deny your God . "
Jud@@ ah said to Sim@@ eon his brother , " Come up with me into my lot , that we may fight against the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites ; and I likewise will go with you into your lot . " so Sim@@ eon went with him .
they found Ad@@ oni @@@ -@@ @ B@@ ez@@ ek in B@@ ez@@ ek ; and they fought against him , and they struck the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ites .
afterward the children of Jud@@ ah went down to fight against the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites who lived in the hill country , and in the South , and in the low@@ land .
from there he went against the inhabitants of Deb@@ ir . ( now the name of Deb@@ ir before was Kiri@@ ath Sep@@ her . )
it happened , when she came , that she got him to ask her father for a field : and she ali@@ ghted from off her don@@ key ; and Cal@@ eb said to her , " What would you like ? "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was with Jud@@ ah ; and drove out the inhabitants of the hill country ; for he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had ch@@ ari@@ ots of iron .
the house of Joseph sent to spy out Be@@ the@@ l . ( now the name of the city before was Lu@@ z . )
the wat@@ chers saw a man come forth out of the city , and they said to him , " Please show us the entrance into the city , and we will deal kindly with you . "
the man went into the land of the Hit@@ ti@@ tes , and built a city , and called its name Lu@@ z , which is its name to this day .
it happened , when Israel had grown strong , that they put the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites to forced labor , and did not utterly drive them out .
Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n did@@ n '@@ t drive out the inhabitants of Kit@@ ron , nor the inhabitants of Na@@ hal@@ ol ; but the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites lived among them , and became subject to forced labor .
but the Ash@@ er@@ ites lived among the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , the inhabitants of the land ; for they did not drive them out .
but the A@@ mor@@ ites would dwell in Mount Her@@ es , in Ai@@ j@@ al@@ on , and in Sha@@ al@@ bi@@ m : yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed , so that they became subject to forced labor .
and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land ; you shall break down their al@@ t@@ ars . ' but you have not listened to my voice : why have you done this ?
therefore I also said , I will not drive them out from before you ; but they shall be in your sides , and their gods shall be a sn@@ are to you . "
the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and served the Ba@@ als ;
and they for@@ s@@ ook Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fathers , who brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other gods , of the gods of the peoples who were around them , and bowed themselves down to them : and they provoked Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to anger .
the anger of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was kind@@ led against Israel , and he delivered them into the hands of spo@@ il@@ ers who despo@@ iled them ; and he sold them into the hands of their enemies all around , so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies .
yet they did@@ n '@@ t listen to their judges ; for they played the pro@@ stitute after other gods , and bowed themselves down to them : they turned aside quickly out of the way in which their fathers walked , obe@@ ying the commandments of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . they did@@ n '@@ t do so .
when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h raised them up judges , then Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was with the judge , and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge : for it griev@@ ed Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h because of their gro@@ aning by reason of those who oppressed them and troubled them .
that by them I may prove Israel , whether they will keep the way of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to walk therein , as their fathers kept it , or not . "
only that the generations of the children of Israel might know , to teach them war , at the least such as before knew nothing of it :
the five lords of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and all the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the Sid@@ onians , and the Hi@@ v@@ ites who lived on Mount Lebanon , from Mount Ba@@ al Her@@ mon to the entrance of Ham@@ ath .
the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and forgot Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God , and served the Ba@@ als and the Ash@@ ero@@ th .
therefore the anger of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was kind@@ led against Israel , and he sold them into the hand of C@@ ush@@ an Ris@@ ha@@ th@@ aim king of Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia : and the children of Israel served C@@ ush@@ an Ris@@ ha@@ th@@ aim eight years .
when the children of Israel cried to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h raised up a s@@ avi@@ or to the children of Israel , who saved them , even O@@ th@@ ni@@ el the son of Ken@@ az , Cal@@ eb 's younger brother .
the Spirit of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came on him , and he judged Israel ; and he went out to war , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h delivered C@@ ush@@ an Ris@@ ha@@ th@@ aim king of Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia into his hand : and his hand prevailed against C@@ ush@@ an Ris@@ ha@@ th@@ aim .
the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h strengthened E@@ gl@@ on the king of Mo@@ ab against Israel , because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
he gathered to him the children of Am@@ mon and A@@ mal@@ ek ; and he went and struck Israel , and they possessed the city of palm trees .
but when the children of Israel cried to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h raised them up a s@@ avi@@ or , Ehud the son of Ger@@ a , the Ben@@ jam@@ ite , a man left @@@ -@@ @ handed . the children of Israel sent tribute by him to E@@ gl@@ on the king of Mo@@ ab .
but he himself turned back from the quar@@ ries that were by Gil@@ gal , and said , " I have a secret err@@ and to you , king . " the king said , " Keep silence ! " all who stood by him went out from him .
and the handle also went in after the blade ; and the fat closed on the blade , for he did@@ n '@@ t draw the sword out of his body ; and it came out behind .
he said to them , " Fol@@ low me ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has delivered your enemies the Mo@@ ab@@ ites into your hand . " they followed him , and took the For@@ ds of the Jordan against the Mo@@ ab@@ ites , and did@@ n '@@ t allow any man to pass over .
they struck of Mo@@ ab at that time about ten thousand men , every lu@@ sty man , and every man of val@@ or ; and there escaped not a man .
the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , when Ehud was dead .
now De@@ bor@@ ah , a proph@@ et@@ ess , the wife of Lap@@ pi@@ do@@ th , she judged Israel at that time .
she lived under the palm tree of De@@ bor@@ ah between Ram@@ ah and Be@@ the@@ l in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment .
I will draw to you , to the river K@@ ish@@ on , S@@ is@@ era , the captain of Jab@@ in 's army , with his ch@@ ari@@ ots and his multitude ; and I will deliver him into your hand . ' "
Bar@@ ak said to her , " If you will go with me , then I will go ; but if you will not go with me , I will not go . "
S@@ is@@ era gathered together all his ch@@ ari@@ ots , even nine hundred ch@@ ari@@ ots of iron , and all the people who were with him , from Har@@ osh@@ eth of the Genti@@ les , to the river K@@ ish@@ on .
De@@ bor@@ ah said to Bar@@ ak , " Go ; for this is the day in which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has delivered S@@ is@@ era into your hand . h@@ as@@ n '@@ t Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h gone out before you ? " so Bar@@ ak went down from Mount Tab@@ or , and ten thousand men after him .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h confused S@@ is@@ era , and all his ch@@ ari@@ ots , and all his army , with the edge of the sword before Bar@@ ak ; and S@@ is@@ era ali@@ ghted from his ch@@ ari@@ ot , and fled away on his feet .
however S@@ is@@ era fled away on his feet to the tent of Ja@@ el the wife of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite ; for there was peace between Jab@@ in the king of Haz@@ or and the house of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite .
Ja@@ el went out to meet S@@ is@@ era , and said to him , " Turn in , my lord , turn in to me ; don '@@ t be afraid . " he came in to her into the tent , and she covered him with a rug .
he said to her , " Please give me a little water to drink ; for I am thir@@ sty . " she opened a bottle of milk , and gave him drink , and covered him .
he said to her , " Stand in the door of the tent , and it shall be , when any man comes and inqui@@ res of you , and says , ' Is there any man here ? ' that you shall say , ' No . ' "
" Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , when you went forth out of Se@@ ir , when you marched out of the field of E@@ dom , the earth trem@@ bled , the sky also dropped . yes , the clouds dropped water .
those whose root is in A@@ mal@@ ek came out of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , after you , Benjamin , among your peoples . governors come down out of Mach@@ ir . those who handle the marsh@@ al 's staff came out of Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n .
Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n was a people that jeopardi@@ zed their lives to the deaths ; N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i also , on the high places of the field .
" the kings came and fought , then the kings of Can@@ a@@ an fought at Ta@@ an@@ ach by the waters of Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do . they took no pl@@ under of silver .
" Ja@@ el shall be blessed above women , the wife of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite ; blessed shall she be above women in the tent .
at her feet he bowed , he fell , he lay . at her feet he bowed , he fell . where he bowed , there he fell down dead .
" so let all your enemies perish , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , but let those who love him be as the sun when it rises forth in its strength . " then the land had rest forty years .
the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h delivered them into the hand of Mi@@ dian seven years .
and they enc@@ amped against them , and destroyed the increase of the earth , until you come to Gaza , and left no sust@@ en@@ ance in Israel , neither sheep , nor ox , nor don@@ key .
and I said to you , " I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God ; you shall not fear the gods of the A@@ mor@@ ites , in whose land you dwell . " but you have not listened to my voice . ' "
the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came , and sat under the oak which was in O@@ ph@@ rah , that per@@ tained to Jo@@ ash the A@@ bi@@ ez@@ rite : and his son G@@ ide@@ on was beating out wheat in the win@@ ep@@ ress , to hide it from the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h looked at him , and said , " Go in this your might , and save Israel from the hand of Mi@@ dian . haven '@@ t I sent you ? "
he said to him , " O Lord , how shall I save Israel ? behold , my family is the poorest in Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and I am the least in my father 's house . "
he said to him , " If now I have found favor in your sight , then show me a sign that it is you who talk with me .
please don '@@ t go away , until I come to you , and bring out my present , and lay it before you . " he said , " I will wait until you come back . "
the angel of God said to him , " Take the meat and the un@@ leav@@ ened cakes , and lay them on this rock , and pour out the bro@@ th . " he did so .
then G@@ ide@@ on built an altar there to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and called it " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is Peace . " to this day it is still in O@@ ph@@ rah of the A@@ bi@@ ez@@ rites .
it happened the same night , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to him , " Take your father 's bull , even the second bull seven years old , and throw down the altar of Ba@@ al that your father has , and cut down the Ash@@ er@@ ah that is by it ;
and build an altar to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God on the top of this strongh@@ old , in an orderly way , and take the second bull , and offer a burnt offering with the wood of the Ash@@ er@@ ah which you shall cut down . "
then all the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites and the children of the east assembled themselves together ; and they passed over , and enc@@ amped in the valley of J@@ ez@@ re@@ el .
he sent messengers throughout all Man@@ as@@ se@@ h ; and they also were gathered together after him : and he sent messengers to Ash@@ er , and to Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n , and to N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i ; and they came up to meet them .
behold , I will put a fle@@ ece of wool on the thresh@@ ing floor ; if there is de@@ w on the fle@@ ece only , and it is dry on all the ground , then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand , as you have spoken . "
then Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al , who is G@@ ide@@ on , and all the people who were with him , rose up early , and enc@@ amped beside the spring of Har@@ od : and the camp of Mi@@ dian was on the north side of them , by the hill of More@@ h , in the valley .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to G@@ ide@@ on , " The people who are with you are too many for me to give the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites into their hand , lest Israel v@@ aunt themselves against me , saying , ' My own hand has saved me . '
now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people , saying , ' Who@@ ever is fearful and trembling , let him return and depart from Mount Gil@@ e@@ ad . ' " twenty @@@ -@@ @ two thousand of the people returned , and ten thousand remained .
so he brought down the people to the water ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to G@@ ide@@ on , " Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue , like a dog laps , you shall set him by himself ; likewise everyone who b@@ ows down on his knees to drink . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to G@@ ide@@ on , " By the three hundred men who lap@@ ped will I save you , and deliver the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites into your hand . let all the other people go , each to his own place . "
so the people took food in their hand , and their trum@@ pets ; and he sent all the men of Israel every man to his tent , but retained the three hundred men : and the camp of Mi@@ dian was beneath him in the valley .
it happened the same night , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to him , " A@@ rise , go down into the camp ; for I have delivered it into your hand .
and you shall hear what they say ; and afterward your hands will be strengthened to go down into the camp . " then went he down with Pur@@ ah his servant to the ou@@ ter@@ most part of the armed men who were in the camp .
the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like lo@@ cu@@ sts for multitude ; and their cam@@ els were without number , as the sand which is on the se@@ ash@@ ore for multitude .
his fellow answered , " This is nothing other than the sword of G@@ ide@@ on the son of Jo@@ ash , a man of Israel . God has delivered Mi@@ dian into his hand , with all the army . "
he divided the three hundred men into three companies , and he put into the hands of all of them trum@@ pets , and empty p@@ itch@@ ers , with tor@@ ches within the p@@ itch@@ ers .
he said to them , " Watch me , and do likewise . behold , when I come to the ou@@ ter@@ most part of the camp , it shall be that , as I do , so you shall do .
the three companies blew the trum@@ pets , and broke the p@@ itch@@ ers , and held the tor@@ ches in their left hands , and the trum@@ pets in their right hands with which to blow ; and they shouted , " The sword of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h and of G@@ ide@@ on ! "
they blew the three hundred trum@@ pets , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h set every man 's sword against his fellow , and against all the army ; and the army fled as far as B@@ eth Sh@@ it@@ tah toward Zer@@ er@@ ah , as far as the border of A@@ bel Me@@ hol@@ ah , by Tab@@ bath .
the men of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im said to him , " Why have you treated us this way , that you did@@ n '@@ t call us , when you went to fight with Mi@@ dian ? " they rebu@@ ked him sharply .
he said to them , " What have I now done in comparison with you ? is@@ n '@@ t the g@@ leaning of the grapes of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im better than the v@@ intage of A@@ bi@@ ez@@ er ?
God has delivered into your hand the princes of Mi@@ dian , O@@ re@@ b and Ze@@ eb ! what was I able to do in comparison with you ? " then their anger was abated toward him , when he had said that .
he said to the men of S@@ uc@@ co@@ th , " Please give lo@@ aves of bread to the people who follow me ; for they are faint , and I am pursuing after Ze@@ ba@@ h and Z@@ al@@ mun@@ na , the kings of Mi@@ dian . "
the princes of S@@ uc@@ co@@ th said , " Are the hands of Ze@@ ba@@ h and Z@@ al@@ mun@@ na now in your hand , that we should give bread to your army ? "
now Ze@@ ba@@ h and Z@@ al@@ mun@@ na were in Kar@@ k@@ or , and their armies with them , about fifteen thousand men , all who were left of all the army of the children of the east ; for there fell one hundred twenty thousand men who drew sword .
G@@ ide@@ on went up by the way of those who lived in tents on the east of Nob@@ ah and J@@ og@@ beha@@ h , and struck the army ; for the army was secure .
he came to the men of S@@ uc@@ co@@ th , and said , " See Ze@@ ba@@ h and Z@@ al@@ mun@@ na , concerning whom you ta@@ un@@ ted me , saying , ' Are the hands of Ze@@ ba@@ h and Z@@ al@@ mun@@ na now in your hand , that we should give bread to your men who are weary ? ' "
then he said to Ze@@ ba@@ h and Z@@ al@@ mun@@ na , " What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tab@@ or ? " they answered , " They were like you . each one resem@@ bled the children of a king . "
he said to Je@@ ther his fir@@ st@@ born , " Get up , and kill them ! " but the youth did@@ n '@@ t draw his sword ; for he was afraid , because he was yet a youth .
then Ze@@ ba@@ h and Z@@ al@@ mun@@ na said , " R@@ ise and fall on us ; for as the man is , so is his strength . " G@@ ide@@ on arose , and killed Ze@@ ba@@ h and Z@@ al@@ mun@@ na , and took the c@@ res@@ cents that were on their cam@@ els ' nec@@ ks .
G@@ ide@@ on said to them , " I would make a request of you , that you would give me every man the ear@@ rings of his spoil . " ( for they had golden ear@@ rings , because they were I@@ sh@@ ma@@ elites . )
G@@ ide@@ on made an ep@@ ho@@ d of it , and put it in his city , even in O@@ ph@@ rah : and all Israel played the pro@@ stitute after it there ; and it became a sn@@ are to G@@ ide@@ on , and to his house .
so Mi@@ dian was subdued before the children of Israel , and they lifted up their heads no more . the land had rest forty years in the days of G@@ ide@@ on .
G@@ ide@@ on the son of Jo@@ ash died in a good old age , and was buried in the tomb of Jo@@ ash his father , in O@@ ph@@ rah of the A@@ bi@@ ez@@ rites .
the children of Israel did@@ n '@@ t remember Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God , who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side ;
neither did they show kindness to the house of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al , G@@ ide@@ on , according to all the goodness which he had shown to Israel .
Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h the son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al went to Sh@@ ec@@ hem to his mother 's brothers , and spoke with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
his mother 's brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem all these words : and their hearts inclined to follow Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h ; for they said , " He is our brother . "
he went to his father 's house at O@@ ph@@ rah , and killed his brothers the sons of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al , being seventy persons , on one stone : but Jo@@ th@@ am the youngest son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al was left ; for he hid himself .
all the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem assembled themselves together , and all the house of Mill@@ o , and went and made Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h king , by the oak of the pillar that was in Sh@@ ec@@ hem .
when they told it to Jo@@ th@@ am , he went and stood on the top of Mount Ger@@ iz@@ im , and lifted up his voice , and cried , and said to them , " List@@ en to me , you men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , that God may listen to you .
" the vine said to them , ' Should I leave my new wine , which che@@ ers God and man , and go to wave back and forth over the trees ? '
" the br@@ am@@ ble said to the trees , ' If in truth you ano@@ int me king over you , then come and take refuge in my shade ; and if not , let fire come out of the br@@ am@@ ble , and dev@@ our the c@@ ed@@ ars of Lebanon . '
" now therefore , if you have dealt truly and righte@@ ously , in that you have made Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h king , and if you have dealt well with Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al and his house , and have done to him according to the deserv@@ ing of his hands
( for my father fought for you , and ris@@ ked his life , and delivered you out of the hand of Mi@@ dian :
and you have risen up against my father 's house this day , and have sl@@ ain his sons , seventy persons , on one stone , and have made Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h , the son of his female servant , king over the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , because he is your brother ) ;
but if not , let fire come out from Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h , and dev@@ our the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and the house of Mill@@ o ; and let fire come out from the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and from the house of Mill@@ o , and dev@@ our Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h . "
the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem set an amb@@ ush for him on the tops of the mountains , and they robbed all who came along that way by them : and it was told Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h .
now therefore , go up by night , you and the people who are with you , and lie in wait in the field :
Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h rose up , and all the people who were with him , by night , and they laid wait against Sh@@ ec@@ hem in four companies .
Ga@@ al the son of E@@ bed went out , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h rose up , and the people who were with him , from the amb@@ ush .
then Ze@@ bul said to him , " Now where is your mouth , that you said , ' Who is Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h , that we should serve him ? ' is@@ n '@@ t this the people that you have desp@@ ised ? please go out now and fight with them . "
it happened on the next day , that the people went out into the field ; and they told Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h .
he took the people , and divided them into three companies , and laid wait in the field ; and he looked , and behold , the people came forth out of the city ; He rose up against them , and struck them .
Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h , and the companies that were with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city : and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field , and struck them .
Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h fought against the city all that day ; and he took the city , and killed the people who were therein : and he beat down the city , and s@@ owed it with salt .
when all the men of the tower of Sh@@ ec@@ hem heard of it , they entered into the strongh@@ old of the house of El@@ ber@@ ith .
all the people likewise each cut down his b@@ ough , and followed Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h , and put them at the base of the strongh@@ old , and set the strongh@@ old on fire on them ; so that all the people of the tower of Sh@@ ec@@ hem died also , about a thousand men and women .
Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h came to the tower , and fought against it , and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire .
then he called hastily to the young man his armor be@@ arer , and said to him , " D@@ raw your sword , and kill me , that men not say of me , ' A woman killed him . ' his young man thrust him through , and he died . "
and all the w@@ ick@@ edness of the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem did God requ@@ ite on their heads : and on them came the curse of Jo@@ th@@ am the son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al .
after Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h there arose to save Israel T@@ ola the son of Pu@@ ah , the son of Do@@ do , a man of Is@@ sac@@ har ; and he lived in Sham@@ ir in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
they troubled and oppressed the children of Israel that year . for eighteen years , they oppressed all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the A@@ mor@@ ites , which is in Gil@@ e@@ ad .
the children of Am@@ mon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Jud@@ ah , and against Benjamin , and against the house of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; so that Israel was very distressed .
the children of Israel cried to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , saying , " We have sin@@ ned against you , even because we have for@@ s@@ aken our God , and have served the Ba@@ als . "
the Sid@@ onians also , and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and the Ma@@ on@@ ites , oppressed you ; and you cried to me , and I saved you out of their hand .
the children of Israel said to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " We have sin@@ ned : do you to us whatever seems good to you ; only deliver us , please , this day . "
they put away the foreign gods from among them , and served Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and his soul was griev@@ ed for the misery of Israel .
then the children of Am@@ mon were gathered together , and enc@@ amped in Gil@@ e@@ ad . the children of Israel assembled themselves together , and enc@@ amped in M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h .
Gil@@ e@@ ad 's wife bore him sons ; and when his wife 's sons grew up , they drove out J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah , and said to him , " You shall not inherit in our father 's house ; for you are the son of another woman . "
then J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah fled from his brothers , and lived in the land of To@@ b : and there were gathered vain fellows to J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah , and they went out with him .
and they said to J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah , " Come and be our chief , that we may fight with the children of Am@@ mon . "
J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah said to the elders of Gil@@ e@@ ad , " did@@ n '@@ t you hate me , and drive me out of my father 's house ? why have you come to me now when you are in distress ? "
J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah said to the elders of Gil@@ e@@ ad , " If you bring me home again to fight with the children of Am@@ mon , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h deliver them before me , shall I be your head ? "
the elders of Gil@@ e@@ ad said to J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall be witness between us ; surely according to your word so will we do . "
J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah sent messengers to the king of the children of Am@@ mon , saying , " What have you to do with me , that you have come to me to fight against my land ? "
but when they came up from Egypt , and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea , and came to Kad@@ esh ;
Israel sent messengers to Si@@ hon king of the A@@ mor@@ ites , the king of H@@ esh@@ bon ; and Israel said to him , ' Please let us pass through your land to my place . '
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , delivered Si@@ hon and all his people into the hand of Israel , and they struck them : so Israel possessed all the land of the A@@ mor@@ ites , the inhabitants of that country .
so now Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , has dis@@ possessed the A@@ mor@@ ites from before his people Israel , and should you possess them ?
now are you anything better than Bal@@ ak the son of Zi@@ pp@@ or , king of Mo@@ ab ? did he ever strive against Israel , or did he ever fight against them ?
I therefore have not sin@@ ned against you , but you do me wrong to war against me . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the Judge , be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Am@@ mon . "
however the king of the children of Am@@ mon did@@ n '@@ t listen to the words of J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah which he sent him .
then the Spirit of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came on J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah , and he passed over Gil@@ e@@ ad and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and passed over M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of Gil@@ e@@ ad , and from M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of Gil@@ e@@ ad he passed over to the children of Am@@ mon .
J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah vowed a vo@@ w to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and said , " If you will indeed deliver the children of Am@@ mon into my hand ,
he struck them from A@@ ro@@ er until you come to Min@@ n@@ ith , even twenty cities , and to A@@ bel@@ cher@@ am@@ im , with a very great slaughter . so the children of Am@@ mon were subdued before the children of Israel .
she said to her father , " Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may depart and go down on the mountains , and be@@ w@@ ail my vir@@ g@@ inity , I and my companions . "
it happened at the end of two months , that she returned to her father , who did with her according to his vo@@ w which he had vowed : and she was a virgin . it was a custom in Israel ,
that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah the Gil@@ e@@ ad@@ ite four days in a year .
J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah said to them , " I and my people were at great strife with the children of Am@@ mon ; and when I called you , you did@@ n '@@ t save me out of their hand .
when I saw that you did@@ n '@@ t save me , I put my life in my hand , and passed over against the children of Am@@ mon , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h delivered them into my hand . why then have you come up to me this day , to fight against me ? "
the Gil@@ e@@ ad@@ ites took the For@@ ds of the Jordan against the E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im@@ ites . it was so , that when the fu@@ gi@@ tives of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im said , " Let me go over , " the men of Gil@@ e@@ ad said to him , " Are you an E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im@@ ite ? " if he said , " No " ;
Ab@@ don the son of Hil@@ lel the Pir@@ ath@@ on@@ ite died , and was buried in Pir@@ athon in the land of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , in the hill country of the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites .
the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h delivered them into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines forty years .
there was a certain man of Zor@@ ah , of the family of the Dan@@ ites , whose name was Man@@ o@@ ah ; and his wife was bar@@ ren , and did@@ n '@@ t bear .
but he said to me , ' Be@@ hold , you shall conceive , and bear a son ; and now drink no wine nor strong drink , and eat not any un@@ clean thing ; for the child shall be a Naz@@ ir@@ ite to God from the womb to the day of his death . ' "
then Man@@ o@@ ah entre@@ ated Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and said , " Oh , Lord , please let the man of God whom you did send come again to us , and teach us what we shall do to the child who shall be born . "
God listened to the voice of Man@@ o@@ ah ; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field : but Man@@ o@@ ah , her husband , was@@ n '@@ t with her .
Man@@ o@@ ah arose , and went after his wife , and came to the man , and said to him , " Are you the man who spoke to the woman ? " he said , " I am . "
she may not eat of anything that comes of the vine , neither let her drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any un@@ clean thing ; all that I commanded her let her observe . "
the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Man@@ o@@ ah , " Th@@ ough you det@@ ain me , I won '@@ t eat of your bread ; and if you will prepare a burnt offering , you must offer it to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . " for Man@@ o@@ ah did@@ n '@@ t know that he was the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
Man@@ o@@ ah said to the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " What is your name , that when your words happen , we may honor you ? "
so Man@@ o@@ ah took the young goat with the meal offering , and offered it on the rock to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . then the angel did a wonderful thing as Man@@ o@@ ah and his wife looked on .
but the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h did@@ n '@@ t appear to Man@@ o@@ ah or to his wife any more . then Man@@ o@@ ah knew that he was the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
but his wife said to him , " If Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h were pleased to kill us , he w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have received a burnt offering and a meal offering at our hand , neither would he have shown us all these things , nor would at this time have told such things as these . "
he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , " I have seen a woman in Tim@@ n@@ ah of the daughters of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : now therefore get her for me as wife . "
after a while he returned to take her ; and he turned aside to see the car@@ c@@ ass of the lion : and behold , there was a s@@ warm of bees in the body of the lion , and honey .
he took it into his hands , and went on , eating as he went ; and he came to his father and mother , and gave to them , and they ate : but he did@@ n '@@ t tell them that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion .
his father went down to the woman : and Sam@@ son made there a feast ; for so used the young men to do .
Sam@@ son said to them , " Let me tell you a rid@@ dle now . if you can declare it to me within the seven days of the feast , and find it out , then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing ;
he said to them , " Out of the e@@ ater came forth food . out of the strong came forth sweet@@ ness . " they cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t in three days declare the rid@@ dle .
her father said , " I most certainly thought that you had utterly hated her ; therefore I gave her to your companion . is@@ n '@@ t her younger sister more beautiful than she ? please take her , instead . "
Sam@@ son said to them , " This time I will be bl@@ am@@ eless in regard of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , when I harm them . "
Sam@@ son said to them , " If you behave like this , surely I will be av@@ eng@@ ed of you , and after that I will cease . "
the men of Jud@@ ah said , " Why have you come up against us ? " they said , " We have come up to bind Sam@@ son , to do to him as he has done to us . "
they spoke to him , saying , " No ; but we will bind you fast , and deliver you into their hand ; but surely we will not kill you . " they bound him with two new ropes , and brought him up from the rock .
when he came to Le@@ hi , the Phil@@ ist@@ ines shouted as they met him : and the Spirit of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came mi@@ gh@@ tily on him , and the ropes that were on his arms became as fla@@ x that was burnt with fire , and his bands dropped from off his hands .
he found a fresh j@@ aw@@ bone of a don@@ key , and put forth his hand , and took it , and struck a thousand men there@@ with .
he was very thir@@ sty , and called on Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and said , " You have given this great deliver@@ ance by the hand of your servant ; and now shall I die for thirst , and fall into the hand of the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised ? "
it came to pass afterward , that he loved a woman in the valley of S@@ ore@@ k , whose name was Del@@ il@@ ah .
Sam@@ son said to her , " If they bind me with seven green cor@@ ds that were never dried , then shall I become weak , and be as another man . "
then the lords of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines brought up to her seven green cor@@ ds which had not been dried , and she bound him with them .
Del@@ il@@ ah said to Sam@@ son , " Be@@ hold , you have mo@@ cked me , and told me lies : now please tell me with which you might be bound . "
he said to her , " If they only bind me with new ropes with which no work has been done , then shall I become weak , and be as another man . "
she fast@@ ened it with the pin , and said to him , " The Phil@@ ist@@ ines are on you , Sam@@ son ! " he awakened out of his sleep , and pl@@ ucked away the pin of the beam , and the web .
she made him sleep on her knees ; and she called for a man , and sha@@ ved off the seven locks of his head ; and she began to aff@@ l@@ ict him , and his strength went from him .
she said , " The Phil@@ ist@@ ines are upon you , Sam@@ son ! " he aw@@ oke out of his sleep , and said , " I will go out as at other times , and shake myself free . " but he did@@ n '@@ t know that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had departed from him .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines laid hold on him , and put out his eyes ; and they brought him down to Gaza , and bound him with fet@@ ters of brass ; and he ground at the mill in the prison .
the lords of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered them together to offer a great sacrifice to D@@ agon their god , and to rejoice ; for they said , " Our god has delivered Sam@@ son our enemy into our hand . "
when the people saw him , they praised their god ; for they said , " Our god has delivered our enemy and the destro@@ yer of our country , who has sl@@ ain many of us , into our hand . "
it happened , when their hearts were mer@@ ry , that they said , " Call for Sam@@ son , that he may entertain us . " they called for Sam@@ son out of the prison ; and he performed before them . they set him between the pillars ;
now the house was full of men and women ; and all the lords of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were there ; and there were on the roof about three thousand men and women , who saw while Sam@@ son performed .
Sam@@ son called to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and said , " Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , remember me , please , and strengthen me , please , only this once , God , that I may be at once av@@ eng@@ ed of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines for my two eyes . "
then his brothers and all the house of his father came down , and took him , and brought him up , and buried him between Zor@@ ah and E@@ sh@@ ta@@ ol in the burial site of Man@@ o@@ ah his father . he judged Israel twenty years .
when he restored the money to his mother , his mother took two hundred pieces of silver , and gave them to the founder , who made of it an engra@@ ved image and a mol@@ ten image : and it was in the house of Mic@@ ah .
Mic@@ ah said to him , " D@@ well with me , and be to me a father and a priest , and I will give you ten pieces of silver per year , a suit of clothing , and your food . " so the Lev@@ ite went in .
then Mic@@ ah said , " Now know I that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will do good to me , since I have a Lev@@ ite to my priest . "
he said to them , " Th@@ us and thus has Mic@@ ah dealt with me , and he has hired me , and I am become his priest . "
when you go , you shall come to a secure people , and the land is large ; for God has given it into your hand , a place where there is no want of anything that is in the earth . "
then the five men who went to spy out the country of La@@ ish answered , and said to their brothers , " Do you know that there is in these houses an ep@@ ho@@ d , and ter@@ ap@@ him , and an engra@@ ved image , and a mol@@ ten image ? now therefore consider what you have to do . "
so they turned and departed , and put the little ones and the livestock and the goods before them .
he said , " You have taken away my gods which I made , and the priest , and have gone away , and what more do I have ? how then do you say to me , ' What ails you ? ' "
the children of Dan said to him , " Don '@@ t let your voice be heard among us , lest angry fellows fall on you , and you lose your life , with the lives of your household . "
they took that which Mic@@ ah had made , and the priest whom he had , and came to La@@ ish , to a people quiet and secure , and struck them with the edge of the sword ; and they burnt the city with fire .
they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born to Israel : however the name of the city was La@@ ish at the first .
the children of Dan set up for themselves the engra@@ ved image : and Jonathan , the son of Ger@@ sh@@ om , the son of Moses , he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Dan@@ ites until the day of the cap@@ tivity of the land .
his conc@@ ub@@ ine played the pro@@ stitute against him , and went away from him to her father 's house to Bethlehem Jud@@ ah , and was there the space of four months .
so they sat down , ate , and drank , both of them together : and the young lady 's father said to the man , " Please be pleased to stay all night , and let your heart be mer@@ ry . "
they turned aside there , to go in to lodge in Gi@@ be@@ ah : and he went in , and sat him down in the street of the city ; for there was no man who took them into his house to lodge .
behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at evening : now the man was of the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and he lived in Gi@@ be@@ ah ; but the men of the place were Ben@@ jam@@ ites .
yet there is both straw and pro@@ ven@@ der for our don@@ keys ; and there is bread and wine also for me , and for your hand@@ maid , and for the young man who is with your servants : there is no want of anything . "
behold , here is my virgin daughter and his conc@@ ub@@ ine . I will bring them out now . humble them , and do with them what seems good to you ; but to this man don '@@ t do any such folly . "
then came the woman in the d@@ aw@@ ning of the day , and fell down at the door of the man 's house where her lord was , until it was light .
her lord rose up in the morning , and opened the doors of the house , and went out to go his way ; and behold , the woman his conc@@ ub@@ ine was fallen down at the door of the house , with her hands on the threshold .
he said to her , " Get up , and let us be going ! " but no one answered . then he took her up on the don@@ key ; and the man rose up , and went to his place .
it was so , that all who saw it said , " There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day ! consider it , take counsel , and speak . "
then all the children of Israel went out , and the congregation was assembled as one man , from Dan even to Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba , with the land of Gil@@ e@@ ad , to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h at M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h .
( now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h . ) The children of Israel said , " Tell us , how did this w@@ ick@@ edness happen ? "
but now this is the thing which we will do to Gi@@ be@@ ah : we will go up against it by lot ;
so all the men of Israel were gathered against the city , knit together as one man .
the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin , saying , " What w@@ ick@@ edness is this that is happen among you ?
the children of Benjamin were numbered on that day out of the cities twenty @@@ -@@ @ six thousand men who drew the sword , besides the inhabitants of Gi@@ be@@ ah , who were numbered seven hundred chosen men .
the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin ; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gi@@ be@@ ah .
the children of Israel went up and we@@ pt before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h until evening ; and they asked of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , saying , " Sh@@ all I again draw near to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother ? " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , " Go up against him . "
Benjamin went forth against them out of Gi@@ be@@ ah the second day , and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men ; all these drew the sword .
the children of Israel asked of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ( for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days ,
and Ph@@ ine@@ has , the son of Ele@@ az@@ ar , the son of Aaron , stood before it in those days ) , saying , " Sh@@ all I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother , or shall I cease ? " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , " Go up ; for tomorrow I will deliver him into your hand . "
the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and set themselves in array against Gi@@ be@@ ah , as at other times .
all the men of Israel rose up out of their place , and set themselves in array at Ba@@ al Tam@@ ar : and the amb@@ ush@@ ers of Israel broke forth out of their place , even out of Ma@@ are@@ h Ge@@ ba .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h struck Benjamin before Israel ; and the children of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand one hundred men : all these drew the sword .
so the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck ; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin , because they trusted the amb@@ ush@@ ers whom they had set against Gi@@ be@@ ah .
they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rim@@ mon : and they g@@ leaned of them in the highways five thousand men , and followed hard after them to Gi@@ dom , and struck of them two thousand men .
the men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin , and struck them with the edge of the sword , both the entire city , and the livestock , and all that they found : moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire .
now the men of Israel had sworn in M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h , saying , " There shall not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin as wife . "
they said , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , why has this happened in Israel , that there should be today one tribe lacking in Israel ? "
it happened on the next day that the people rose early , and built there an altar , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings .
how shall we provide wives for those who remain , since we have sworn by Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h that we will not give them of our daughters to wives ? "
the congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the most val@@ i@@ ant , and commanded them , saying , " Go and strike the inhabitants of Jab@@ esh Gil@@ e@@ ad with the edge of the sword , with the women and the little ones .
this is the thing that you shall do : you shall utterly destroy every male , and every woman who has lain with a man . "
they found among the inhabitants of Jab@@ esh Gil@@ e@@ ad four hundred young vir@@ gins , who had not known man by lying with him ; and they brought them to the camp to Sh@@ il@@ oh , which is in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
the whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rim@@ mon , and proclaimed peace to them .
the people griev@@ ed for Benjamin , because that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had made a breach in the tribes of Israel .
they said , " There must be an inheritance for those who are escaped of Benjamin , that a tribe not be blo@@ tted out from Israel .
however we may not give them wives of our daughters , for the children of Israel had sworn , saying , ' Cur@@ sed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin . ' "
they said , " Be@@ hold , there is a feast of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h from year to year in Sh@@ il@@ oh , which is on the north of Be@@ the@@ l , on the east side of the highway that goes up from Be@@ the@@ l to Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and on the south of Le@@ bon@@ ah . "
they commanded the children of Benjamin , saying , " Go and lie in wait in the vineyards ,
the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wives , according to their number , of those who danced , whom they carried off . they went and returned to their inheritance , built the cities , and lived in them .
the children of Israel departed there at that time , every man to his tribe and to his family , and they went out from there every man to his inheritance .
it happened in the days when the judges judged , that there was a famine in the land . a certain man of Bethlehem Jud@@ ah went to live in the country of Mo@@ ab , he , and his wife , and his two sons .
the name of the man was E@@ lim@@ elec@@ h , and the name of his wife Na@@ omi , and the name of his two sons Mah@@ lon and Ch@@ ilion , E@@ ph@@ ra@@ th@@ ites of Bethlehem Jud@@ ah . they came into the country of Mo@@ ab , and continued there .
they took them wives of the women of Mo@@ ab ; the name of the one was Or@@ pa@@ h , and the name of the other Ru@@ th : and they lived there about ten years .
she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two daughters @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law with her ; and they went on the way to return to the land of Jud@@ ah .
Na@@ omi said to her two daughters @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , " Go , return each of you to her mother 's house : Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h deal kindly with you , as you have dealt with the dead , and with me .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h grant you that you may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . " then she kis@@ sed them , and they lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt .
they lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt again : and Or@@ pa@@ h kis@@ sed her mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , but Ru@@ th joined with her .
she said , " Be@@ hold , your sister @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law has gone back to her people , and to her god . follow your sister @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law . "
so they two went until they came to Bethlehem . it happened , when they had come to Bethlehem , that all the city was moved about them , and they asked , " Is this Na@@ omi ? "
so Na@@ omi returned , and Ru@@ th the Mo@@ ab@@ it@@ ess , her daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , with her , who returned out of the country of Mo@@ ab : and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
Na@@ omi had a kin@@ sman of her husband 's , a mighty man of wealth , of the family of E@@ lim@@ elec@@ h , and his name was Bo@@ az .
Ru@@ th the Mo@@ ab@@ it@@ ess said to Na@@ omi , " Let me now go to the field , and g@@ lean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor . " she said to her , " Go , my daughter . "
she went , and came and g@@ leaned in the field after the re@@ apers : and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Bo@@ az , who was of the family of E@@ lim@@ elec@@ h .
behold , Bo@@ az came from Bethlehem , and said to the re@@ apers , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h be with you . " they answered him , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h bless you . "
then Bo@@ az said to his servant who was set over the re@@ apers , " Wh@@ ose young lady is this ? "
she said , ' Please let me g@@ lean and gather after the re@@ apers among the she@@ aves . ' so she came , and has continued even from the morning until now , except that she stayed a little in the house . "
then Bo@@ az said to Ru@@ th , " List@@ en , my daughter . Don '@@ t go to g@@ lean in another field , and don '@@ t go from here , but stay here close to my mai@@ dens .
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said to him , " Why have I found favor in your sight , that you should take knowledge of me , since I am a foreigner ? "
then she said , " Let me find favor in your sight , my lord , because you have comfor@@ ted me , and because you have spoken kindly to your hand@@ maid , though I am not as one of your hand@@ mai@@ dens . "
also pull out some for her from the bun@@ dles , and leave it , and let her g@@ lean , and don '@@ t rebu@@ ke her . "
she took it up , and went into the city ; and her mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law saw what she had g@@ leaned : and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she was suff@@ iced .
Na@@ omi said to Ru@@ th her daughter @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , " It is good , my daughter , that you go out with his mai@@ dens , and that they not meet you in any other field . "
so she stayed close to the mai@@ dens of Bo@@ az , to g@@ lean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest ; and she lived with her mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law .
Na@@ omi her mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law said to her , " My daughter , shall I not seek rest for you , that it may be well with you ?
therefore wash yourself , ano@@ int yourself , get dressed , and go down to the thresh@@ ing floor , but don '@@ t make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking .
it shall be , when he lies down , that you shall mark the place where he shall lie , and you shall go in , and un@@ cover his feet , and lay down ; then he will tell you what you shall do . "
when Bo@@ az had eaten and drunk , and his heart was mer@@ ry , he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain . she came softly , uncovered his feet , and laid her down .
it happened at midnight , that the man was star@@ tled and turned himself ; and behold , a woman lay at his feet .
he said , " Who are you ? " she answered , " I am Ru@@ th your hand@@ maid . therefore spread your skirt over your hand@@ maid ; for you are a near kin@@ sman . "
now , my daughter , don '@@ t be afraid ; I will do to you all that you say ; for all the city of my people does know that you are a worthy woman .
he said , " B@@ ring the mantle that is on you , and hold it . " she held it ; and he measured six measures of barley , and laid it on her ; and he went into the city .
when she came to her mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , she said , " How did it go , my daughter ? " she told her all that the man had done to her .
she said , " He gave me these six measures of barley ; for he said , ' Don '@@ t go empty to your mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law . ' "
then she said , " S@@ it still , my daughter , until you know how the matter will fall ; for the man will not rest , until he has finished the thing this day . "
now Bo@@ az went up to the gate , and sat down there . behold , the near kin@@ sman of whom Bo@@ az spoke came by ; to whom he said , " Come over here , friend , and sit down ! " he turned aside , and sat down .
he took ten men of the elders of the city , and said , " S@@ it down here . " they sat down .
then Bo@@ az said , " On the day you buy the field from the hand of Na@@ omi , you must buy it also from Ru@@ th the Mo@@ ab@@ it@@ ess , the wife of the dead , to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance . "
the near kin@@ sman said , " I can '@@ t re@@ deem it for myself , lest I mar my own inheritance . take my right of redemption for yourself ; for I can '@@ t re@@ deem it . "
now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning re@@ deem@@ ing and concerning exchanging , to confirm all things : a man took off his shoe , and gave it to his neighbor ; and this was the way of att@@ est@@ ation in Israel .
so the near kin@@ sman said to Bo@@ az , " Buy it for yourself . " he took off his shoe .
the women said to Na@@ omi , " Bless@@ ed be Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , who has not left you this day without a near kin@@ sman ; and let his name be famous in Israel .
the women , her neighbors , gave him a name , saying , " There is a son born to Na@@ omi " ; and they named him O@@ bed . he is the father of Jes@@ se , the father of David .
now there was a certain man of Ram@@ ath@@ aim Z@@ op@@ him , of the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and his name was El@@ kan@@ ah , the son of J@@ ero@@ ham , the son of Eli@@ hu , the son of to@@ hu , the son of Z@@ up@@ h , an E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im@@ ite :
and he had two wives ; the name of the one was Hann@@ ah , and the name of other Pen@@ in@@ n@@ ah : and Pen@@ in@@ n@@ ah had children , but Hann@@ ah had no children .
this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies in Sh@@ il@@ oh . the two sons of El@@ i , Hop@@ hn@@ i and Ph@@ ine@@ has , priests to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , were there .
but to Hann@@ ah he gave a double portion ; for he loved Hann@@ ah , but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had shut up her womb .
as he did so year by year , when she went up to the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , so she provoked her ; therefore she we@@ pt , and did@@ n '@@ t eat .
so Hann@@ ah rose up after they had eaten in Sh@@ il@@ oh , and after they had drunk . now El@@ i the priest was sitting on his seat by the door@@ post of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's temple .
Don '@@ t count your hand@@ maid for a wicked woman ; for I have been speaking out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation . "
it happened , when the time had come , that Hann@@ ah conceived , and bore a son ; and she named him Samuel , saying , " Because I have asked him of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
the man El@@ kan@@ ah , and all his house , went up to offer to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h the yearly sacrifice , and his vo@@ w .
but Hann@@ ah did@@ n '@@ t go up ; for she said to her husband , " Not until the child is we@@ an@@ ed ; then I will bring him , that he may appear before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and stay there forever . "
when she had we@@ an@@ ed him , she took him up with her , with three bul@@ ls , and one ep@@ ha@@ h of meal , and a bottle of wine , and brought him to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's house in Sh@@ il@@ oh . the child was young .
therefore also I have granted him to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . as long as he lives he is granted to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . " he worshi@@ ped Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h there .
" talk no more so exceeding proudly . Don '@@ t let arrogance come out of your mouth , For Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is a God of knowledge . by him actions are weighed .
the custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice , the priest 's servant came , while the flesh was boiling , with a for@@ k of three teeth in his hand ;
yes , before they burnt the fat , the priest 's servant came , and said to the man who sacrificed , " Gi@@ ve meat to ro@@ ast for the priest ; for he will not accept boiled meat from you , but raw . "
moreover his mother made him a little robe , and brought it to him from year to year , when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice .
now El@@ i was very old ; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel , and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the T@@ ent of Meeting .
a man of God came to El@@ i , and said to him , " Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' Did I reveal myself to the house of your father , when they were in Egypt in bond@@ age to Phar@@ aoh 's house ?
behold , the days come , that I will cut off your arm , and the arm of your father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in your house .
the man of yours , whom I shall not cut off from my altar , shall consume your eyes , and gri@@ eve your heart ; and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age .
" ' this shall be the sign to you , that shall come on your two sons , on Hop@@ hn@@ i and Ph@@ ine@@ has : in one day they shall both die .
I will raise me up a faithful priest , that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind . I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before my ano@@ inted forever .
therefore El@@ i said to Samuel , " Go , lie down : and it shall be , if he calls you , that you shall say , ' Spe@@ ak , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; for your servant hears . ' " so Samuel went and lay down in his place .
for I have told him that I will judge his house forever , for the ini@@ qu@@ ity which he knew , because his sons brought a curse on themselves , and he did@@ n '@@ t restrain them .
therefore I have sworn to the house of El@@ i , that the ini@@ qu@@ ity of El@@ i 's house shall not be removed with sacrifice nor offering forever . "
then El@@ i called Samuel , and said , " Samuel , my son ! " he said , " Here I am . "
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines put themselves in array against Israel : and when they joined battle , Israel was struck before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men .
when the people had come into the camp , the elders of Israel said , " Why has Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h struck us today before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ? let us get the ark of the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h out of Sh@@ il@@ oh to us , that it may come among us , and save us out of the hand of our enemies . "
when the ark of the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came into the camp , all Israel shouted with a great shout , so that the earth rang again .
w@@ oe to us ! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods ? these are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all kinds of pl@@ agues in the wilderness .
be strong , and behave like men , O you Phil@@ ist@@ ines , that you not be servants to the He@@ bre@@ ws , as they have been to you . strengthen yourselves like men , and fight ! "
when he came , behold , El@@ i was sitting on his seat by the road watching ; for his heart trem@@ bled for the ark of God . when the man came into the city , and told it , all the city cried out .
the man said to El@@ i , " I am he who came out of the army , and I fled today out of the army . " he said , " How did the matter go , my son ? "
he who brought the news answered , " Israel has fled before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and there has been also a great slaughter among the people . your two sons also , Hop@@ hn@@ i and Ph@@ ine@@ has , are dead , and the ark of God has been captured . "
she named the child I@@ ch@@ ab@@ od , saying , " The glory has departed from Israel " ; because the ark of God was taken , and because of her father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law and her husband .
when they of Ash@@ do@@ d arose early on the next day , behold , D@@ agon was fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . they took D@@ agon , and set him in his place again .
therefore neither the priests of D@@ agon , nor any who come into D@@ agon 's house , t@@ read on the threshold of D@@ agon in Ash@@ do@@ d , to this day .
it was so , that after they had carried it about , the hand of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was against the city with a very great confusion : and he struck the men of the city , both small and great ; and tumors broke out on them .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines called for the priests and the div@@ in@@ ers , saying , " What shall we do with the ark of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ? show us with which we shall send it to its place . "
then they said , " What shall be the t@@ resp@@ ass offering which we shall return to him ? " they said , " Five golden tumors , and five golden mice , for the number of the lords of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; for one plague was on you all , and on your lords .
therefore you shall make images of your tumors , and images of your mice that mar the land ; and you shall give glory to the God of Israel : perhaps he will ligh@@ ten his hand from off you , and from off your gods , and from off your land .
" now therefore take and prepare yourselves a new cart , and two milk cows , on which there has come no y@@ oke ; and tie the cows to the cart , and bring their cal@@ ves home from them ;
and take the ark of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and lay it on the cart ; and put the jew@@ els of gold , which you return him for a t@@ resp@@ ass offering , in a coff@@ er by its side ; and send it away , that it may go .
the Lev@@ ites took down the ark of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the coff@@ er that was with it , in which the jew@@ els of gold were , and put them on the great stone : and the men of B@@ eth Sh@@ em@@ esh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
he struck of the men of B@@ eth Sh@@ em@@ esh , because they had looked into the ark of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , he struck of the people fifty thousand seventy men ; and the people mour@@ ned , because Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had struck the people with a great slaughter .
the men of B@@ eth Sh@@ em@@ esh said , " Who is able to stand before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , this holy God ? to whom shall he go up from us ? "
it happened , from the day that the ark stayed in Kiri@@ ath j@@ ear@@ im , that the time was long ; for it was twenty years : and all the house of Israel lam@@ ented after Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
they gathered together to M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h , and drew water , and poured it out before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and fast@@ ed on that day , and said there , " We have sin@@ ned against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . " Samuel judged the children of Israel in M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h .
when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together at M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h , the lords of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went up against Israel . when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
the children of Israel said to Samuel , " Don '@@ t cease to cry to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering , the Phil@@ ist@@ ines drew near to battle against Israel ; but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h thunder@@ ed with a great thunder on that day on the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and confused them ; and they were struck down before Israel .
the men of Israel went out of M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h , and pursued the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and struck them , until they came under B@@ eth K@@ ar .
so the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were subdued , and they came no more within the border of Israel . the hand of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines all the days of Samuel .
now the name of his fir@@ st@@ born was Jo@@ el ; and the name of his second , A@@ bi@@ jah : they were judges in Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Samuel , " List@@ en to the voice of the people in all that they tell you ; for they have not rejected you , but they have rejected me , that I should not be king over them .
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day , in that they have for@@ s@@ aken me , and served other gods , so do they also to you .
he said , " This will be the way of the king who shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them to him , for his ch@@ ari@@ ots , and to be his hor@@ sem@@ en ; and they shall run before his ch@@ ari@@ ots ;
he will take your male servants , and your female servants , and your best young men , and your don@@ keys , and put them to his work .
you shall cry out in that day because of your king whom you shall have chosen you ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will not answer you in that day . "
but the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel ; and they said , " No ; but we will have a king over us ,
that we also may be like all the nations , and that our king may judge us , and go out before us , and fight our battles . "
Samuel heard all the words of the people , and he rehear@@ sed them in the ears of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
he had a son , whose name was Saul , an impressive young man ; and there was not among the children of Israel a better person than he . from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people .
the don@@ keys of K@@ ish , Saul 's father , were lost . K@@ ish said to Saul his son , " Take now one of the servants with you , and arise , go seek the don@@ keys . "
when they had come to the land of Z@@ up@@ h , Saul said to his servant who was with him , " Come , and let us return , lest my father stop caring about the don@@ keys , and be anxious for us . "
then Saul said to his servant , " But , behold , if we go , what shall we bring the man ? for the bread is spent in our vessels , and there is not a present to bring to the man of God . what do we have ? "
then Saul said to his servant , " Well said . come , let us go . " so they went to the city where the man of God was .
as they went up the ascent to the city , they found young mai@@ dens going out to draw water , and said to them , " Is the se@@ er here ? "
they answered them , and said , " He is . behold , he is before you . hurry now , for he has come today into the city ; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place .
when Samuel saw Saul , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to him , " Be@@ hold , the man of whom I spoke to you ! this same shall have authority over my people . "
then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate , and said , " Please tell me where the se@@ er 's house is . "
Samuel answered Saul , and said , " I am the se@@ er . go up before me to the high place , for you shall eat with me today . in the morning I will let you go , and will tell you all that is in your heart .
as for your don@@ keys who were lost three days ago , don '@@ t set your mind on them ; for they are found . for whom is all that is desirable in Israel ? is it not for you , and for all your father 's house ? "
Samuel took Saul and his servant , and brought them into the guest room , and made them sit in the best place among those who were invited , who were about thirty persons .
they arose early : and it happened about the spring of the day , that Samuel called to Saul on the hous@@ et@@ op , saying , " Get up , that I may send you away . " Saul arose , and they went out both of them , he and Samuel , abroad .
then Samuel took the vial of oil , and poured it on his head , and kis@@ sed him , and said , " is@@ n '@@ t it that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has ano@@ inted you to be prince over his inheritance ?
and the Spirit of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will come mi@@ gh@@ tily on you , and you shall proph@@ esy with them , and shall be turned into another man .
let it be , when these signs have come to you , that you do as occasion shall serve you ; for God is with you .
" you shall go down before me to Gil@@ gal ; and behold , I will come down to you , to offer burnt offerings , and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings : you shall wait seven days , until I come to you , and show you what you shall do . "
when they came there to the hill , behold , a band of prophets met him ; and the Spirit of God came mi@@ gh@@ tily on him , and he prophe@@ si@@ ed among them .
it happened , when all who knew him before saw that , behold , he prophe@@ si@@ ed with the prophets , then the people said one to another , " What is this that has come to the son of K@@ ish ? is Saul also among the prophets ? "
Saul 's uncle said to him and to his servant , " Where did you go ? " he said , " To seek the don@@ keys . when we saw that they were not found , we came to Samuel . "
Saul said to his uncle , " He told us plainly that the don@@ keys were found . " but concerning the matter of the kingdom , of which Samuel spoke , he did@@ n '@@ t tell him .
he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families ; and the family of the Mat@@ rites was taken ; and Saul the son of K@@ ish was taken : but when they sought him , he could not be found .
they ran and fetched him there ; and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward .
Samuel said to all the people , " You see him whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has chosen , that there is none like him among all the people ? " all the people shouted , and said , " Let the king live ! "
then Samuel told the people the regulations of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
then N@@ ah@@ ash the Am@@ mon@@ ite came up , and enc@@ amped against Jab@@ esh Gil@@ e@@ ad : and all the men of Jab@@ esh said to N@@ ah@@ ash , " Make a covenant with us , and we will serve you . "
N@@ ah@@ ash the Am@@ mon@@ ite said to them , " On this condition I will make it with you , that all your right eyes be put out ; and I will lay it for a repro@@ ach on all Israel . "
the elders of Jab@@ esh said to him , " Gi@@ ve us seven day , that we may send messengers to all the borders of Israel ; and then , if there is no one to save us , we will come out to you . "
behold , Saul came following the ox@@ en out of the field ; and Saul said , " What ails the people that they we@@ ep ? " they told him the words of the men of Jab@@ esh .
he numbered them in B@@ ez@@ ek ; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand , and the men of Jud@@ ah thirty thousand .
therefore the men of Jab@@ esh said , " Tom@@ orrow we will come out to you , and you shall do with us all that seems good to you . "
the people said to Samuel , " Who is he who said , ' Sh@@ all Saul reign over us ? ' bring those men , that we may put them to death ! "
Saul said , " There shall not a man be put to death this day ; for today Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has worked deliver@@ ance in Israel . "
all the people went to Gil@@ gal ; and there they made Saul king before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in Gil@@ gal ; and there they offered sacrifices of peace offerings before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejo@@ iced greatly .
now , behold , the king walks before you ; and I am old and gray @@@ -@@ @ headed ; and behold , my sons are with you : and I have walked before you from my youth to this day .
he said to them , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is witness against you , and his ano@@ inted is witness this day , that you have not found anything in my hand . " they said , " He is witness . "
Samuel said to the people , " It is Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h who appointed Moses and Aaron , and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt .
now therefore stand still , that I may ple@@ ad with you before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h concerning all the righteous acts of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he did to you and to your fathers .
" but they forgot Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God ; and he sold them into the hand of S@@ is@@ era , captain of the army of Haz@@ or , and into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and into the hand of the king of Mo@@ ab ; and they fought against them .
they cried to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and said , ' We have sin@@ ned , because we have for@@ s@@ aken Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and have served the Ba@@ als and the Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th : but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies , and we will serve you . '
" when you saw that N@@ ah@@ ash the king of the children of Am@@ mon came against you , you said to me , ' No , but a king shall reign over us ; ' when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God was your king .
now therefore see the king whom you have chosen , and whom you have asked for : and behold , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has set a king over you .
but if you will not listen to the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , but rebel against the commandment of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , then will the hand of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h be against you , as it was against your fathers .
is@@ n '@@ t it wheat harvest today ? I will call to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that he may send thunder and rain ; and you shall know and see that your w@@ ick@@ edness is great , which you have done in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , in asking for a king . "
all the people said to Samuel , " Pr@@ ay for your servants to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , that we not die ; for we have added to all our sins this evil , to ask us a king . "
Samuel said to the people , " Don '@@ t be afraid . you have indeed done all this evil ; yet don '@@ t turn aside from following Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , but serve Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h with all your heart .
for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will not for@@ sake his people for his great name 's sake , because it has pleased Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to make you a people to himself .
moreover as for me , far be it from me that I should sin against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in c@@ easing to pray for you : but I will instruct you in the good and the right way .
Jonathan struck the gar@@ rison of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines that was in Ge@@ ba : and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard of it . Saul blew the trum@@ pet throughout all the land , saying , " Let the He@@ bre@@ ws hear ! "
all Israel heard that Saul had struck the gar@@ rison of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and also that Israel was had in ab@@ om@@ ination with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . the people were gathered together after Saul to Gil@@ gal .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel , thirty thousand ch@@ ari@@ ots , and six thousand hor@@ sem@@ en , and people as the sand which is on the se@@ ash@@ ore in multitude : and they came up , and enc@@ amped in Mic@@ h@@ mash , eastward of B@@ eth A@@ ven .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a str@@ ait ( for the people were distressed ) , then the people hid themselves in caves , and in th@@ ic@@ kets , and in rocks , and in cover@@ ts , and in pits .
now some of the He@@ bre@@ ws had gone over the Jordan to the land of G@@ ad and Gil@@ e@@ ad ; but as for Saul , he was yet in Gil@@ gal , and all the people followed him trembling .
Samuel said , " What have you done ? " Saul said , " Because I saw that the people were scattered from me , and that you did@@ n '@@ t come within the days appointed , and that the Phil@@ ist@@ ines assembled themselves together at Mic@@ h@@ mash ;
therefore I said , ' Now the Phil@@ ist@@ ines will come down on me to Gil@@ gal , and I haven '@@ t entre@@ ated the favor of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . ' I forced myself therefore , and offered the burnt offering . "
Samuel said to Saul , " You have done fool@@ ishly . you have not kept the commandment of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , which he commanded you ; for now Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h would have established your kingdom on Israel forever .
the spo@@ il@@ ers came out of the camp of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines in three companies : one company turned to the way that leads to O@@ ph@@ rah , to the land of Sh@@ ual ;
now there was no sm@@ ith found throughout all the land of Israel ; for the Phil@@ ist@@ ines said , " L@@ est the He@@ bre@@ ws make them s@@ words or spe@@ ars " ;
so it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither sword nor spe@@ ar found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan : but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found .
Saul stayed in the utter@@ most part of Gi@@ be@@ ah under the p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate tree which is in Mi@@ gr@@ on : and the people who were with him were about six hundred men ;
and A@@ hij@@ ah , the son of Ah@@ it@@ u@@ b , I@@ ch@@ ab@@ od 's brother , the son of Ph@@ ine@@ has , the son of El@@ i , the priest of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in Sh@@ il@@ oh , wearing an ep@@ ho@@ d . the people did@@ n '@@ t know that Jonathan was gone .
his armor be@@ arer said to him , " Do all that is in your heart . turn and , behold , I am with you according to your heart . "
but if they say this , ' Come up to us ! ' then we will go up ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has delivered them into our hand . this shall be the sign to us . "
both of them revealed themselves to the gar@@ rison of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines said , " Be@@ hold , the He@@ bre@@ ws are coming out of the holes where they had hidden themselves ! "
there was a trembling in the camp , in the field , and among all the people ; the gar@@ rison , and the spo@@ il@@ ers , they also trem@@ bled ; and the earth qu@@ aked : so there was an exceeding great trembling .
then Saul said to the people who were with him , " Count now , and see who is missing from us . " when they had counted , behold , Jonathan and his armor be@@ arer were not there .
it happened , while Saul talked to the priest , that the tum@@ ult that was in the camp of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went on and increased : and Saul said to the priest , " With@@ draw your hand ! "
now the He@@ bre@@ ws who were with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines as before , and who went up with them into the camp , from all around , even they also turned to be with the Israel@@ ites who were with Saul and Jonathan .
the men of Israel were distressed that day ; for Saul had adju@@ red the people , saying , " Cur@@ sed is the man who eats any food until it is evening , and I am av@@ eng@@ ed of my enemies . " so none of the people t@@ asted food .
but Jonathan did@@ n '@@ t hear when his father commanded the people with the oath : therefore he put forth the end of the rod who was in his hand , and di@@ pped it in the honey@@ comb , and put his hand to his mouth ; and his eyes were enlightened .
then one of the people answered , and said , " Your father directly commanded the people with an oath , saying , ' Cur@@ sed is the man who eats food this day . ' " the people were faint .
then Jonathan said , " My father has troubled the land . please look how my eyes have been enlightened , because I t@@ asted a little of this honey .
and the people flew on the spoil , and took sheep , and cattle , and cal@@ ves , and killed them on the ground ; and the people ate them with the blood .
Saul asked counsel of God , " Sh@@ all I go down after the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ? will you deliver them into the hand of Israel ? " but he did@@ n '@@ t answer him that day .
Saul said , " D@@ raw near here , all you chiefs of the people ; and know and see in which this sin has been this day .
then he said to all Israel , " You be on one side , and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side . " the people said to Saul , " Do what seems good to you . "
he did val@@ i@@ antly , and struck the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who despo@@ iled them .
now the sons of Saul were Jonathan , and I@@ sh@@ vi , and Mal@@ ch@@ ish@@ ua ; and the names of his two daughters were these : the name of the fir@@ st@@ born Mer@@ ab , and the name of the younger Mic@@ h@@ al :
and the name of Saul 's wife was Ah@@ ino@@ am the daughter of A@@ him@@ a@@ az . the name of the captain of his army was Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , Saul 's uncle .
Samuel said to Saul , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h sent me to ano@@ int you to be king over his people , over Israel . now therefore listen to the voice of the words of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , ' I have marked that which A@@ mal@@ ek did to Israel , how he set himself against him in the way , when he came up out of Egypt .
Samuel came to Saul ; and Saul said to him , " You are blessed by Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ! I have performed the commandment of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
Samuel said , " Then what does this ble@@ ating of the sheep in my ears , and the lowing of the cattle which I hear mean ? "
Saul said , " They have brought them from the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites ; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the cattle , to sacrifice to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God . we have utterly destroyed the rest . "
then Samuel said to Saul , " Stay , and I will tell you what Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has said to me last night . " he said to him , " S@@ ay on . "
Samuel said , " Th@@ ough you were little in your own sight , wer@@ en '@@ t you made the head of the tribes of Israel ? Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ano@@ inted you king over Israel ;
Saul said to Samuel , " But I have obeyed the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and have gone the way which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h sent me , and have brought Ag@@ ag the king of A@@ mal@@ ek , and have utterly destroyed the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites .
Saul said to Samuel , " I have sin@@ ned ; for I have trans@@ g@@ ressed the commandment of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and your words , because I feared the people , and obeyed their voice .
then he said , " I have sin@@ ned : yet please honor me now before the elders of my people , and before Israel , and come back with me , that I may worship Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God . "
then Samuel said , " B@@ ring here to me Ag@@ ag the king of the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites ! " Ag@@ ag came to him cheer@@ fully . Ag@@ ag said , " Su@@ rely the bitterness of death is past . "
Samuel said , " How can I go ? if Saul hears it , he will kill me . " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , " Take a hei@@ fer with you , and say , I have come to sacrifice to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
he said , " peace@@ ably ; I have come to sacrifice to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . sancti@@ fy yourselves , and come with me to the sacrifice . " he sancti@@ fied Jes@@ se and his sons , and called them to the sacrifice .
it happened , when they had come , that he looked at Eli@@ ab , and said , " Su@@ rely Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's ano@@ inted is before him . "
but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Samuel , " Don '@@ t look on his face , or on the height of his stature ; because I have rejected him : for I see not as man sees ; for man looks at the outward appearance , but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h looks at the heart . "
then Jes@@ se made Sham@@ ma@@ h to pass by . he said , " N@@ either has Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h chosen this one . "
he sent , and brought him in . now he was rud@@ dy , and with@@ al of a beautiful face , and goo@@ dly to look on . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , " A@@ rise , ano@@ int him ; for this is he . "
then Samuel took the horn of oil , and ano@@ inted him in the midst of his brothers : and the Spirit of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came mi@@ gh@@ tily on David from that day forward . so Samuel rose up , and went to Ram@@ ah .
let our lord now command your servants who are before you , to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the har@@ p . it shall happen , when the evil spirit from God is on you , that he shall play with his hand , and you shall be well . "
it happened , when the spirit from God was on Saul , that David took the har@@ p , and played with his hand : so Saul was refresh@@ ed , and was well , and the evil spirit departed from him .
now the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered together their armies to battle ; and they were gathered together at Soc@@ oh , which belongs to Jud@@ ah , and enc@@ amped between Soc@@ oh and A@@ ze@@ k@@ ah , in E@@ ph@@ es@@ dam@@ mi@@ m .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines stood on the mountain on the one side , and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side : and there was a valley between them .
there went out a champion out of the camp of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , named G@@ oli@@ ath , of G@@ ath , whose height was six cub@@ its and a span .
he had a helmet of brass on his head , and he was cl@@ ad with a coat of mail ; and the weight of the coat was five thousand she@@ k@@ els of brass .
the staff of his spe@@ ar was like a we@@ aver 's beam ; and his spe@@ ar 's head weighed six hundred she@@ k@@ els of iron : and his shield be@@ arer went before him .
if he be able to fight with me , and kill me , then will we be your servants ; but if I prevail against him , and kill him , then you will be our servants , and serve us . "
the Phil@@ ist@@ ine said , " I defy the armies of Israel this day ! give me a man , that we may fight together ! "
now David was the son of that E@@ ph@@ ra@@ th@@ ite of Bethlehem Jud@@ ah , whose name was Jes@@ se ; and he had eight sons : and the man was an old man in the days of Saul , stricken among men .
the three el@@ dest sons of Jes@@ se had gone after Saul to the battle : and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eli@@ ab the fir@@ st@@ born , and next to him Ab@@ in@@ ad@@ ab , and the third Sham@@ ma@@ h .
Jes@@ se said to David his son , " Now take for your brothers an ep@@ ha@@ h of this par@@ ched grain , and these ten lo@@ aves , and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers ;
David rose up early in the morning , and left the sheep with a keeper , and took , and went , as Jes@@ se had commanded him ; and he came to the place of the w@@ agons , as the army which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle .
David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage , and ran to the army , and came and greeted his brothers .
as he talked with them , behold , there came up the champion , the Phil@@ ist@@ ine of G@@ ath , G@@ oli@@ ath by name , out of the ranks of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and spoke according to the same words : and David heard them .
all the men of Israel , when they saw the man , fled from him , and were terrified .
David spoke to the men who stood by him , saying , " What shall be done to the man who kills this Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and takes away the repro@@ ach from Israel ? for who is this un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised Phil@@ ist@@ ine , that he should defy the armies of the living God ? "
Saul said to David , " You are not able to go against this Phil@@ ist@@ ine to fight with him ; for you are but a youth , and he a man of war from his youth . "
David said to Saul , " Your servant was keeping his father 's sheep ; and when a lion or a bear came , and took a lamb out of the flock ,
I went out after him , and struck him , and rescued it out of his mouth . when he arose against me , I caught him by his beard , and struck him , and killed him .
David said , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h who delivered me out of the pa@@ w of the lion , and out of the pa@@ w of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Phil@@ ist@@ ine . " Saul said to David , " Go ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall be with you . "
when the Phil@@ ist@@ ine looked about , and saw David , he disd@@ ained him ; for he was but a youth , and rud@@ dy , and with@@ al of a fair face .
and that all this assembly may know that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h do@@ es@@ n '@@ t save with sword and spe@@ ar : for the battle is Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's , and he will give you into our hand . "
so David prevailed over the Phil@@ ist@@ ine with a s@@ ling and with a stone , and struck the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and killed him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
then David ran , and stood over the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and took his sword , and drew it out of its she@@ ath , and killed him , and cut off his head there@@ with . when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines saw that their champion was dead , they fled .
when Saul saw David go forth against the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , he said to Ab@@ ner , the captain of the army , " Ab@@ ner , whose son is this youth ? " Ab@@ ner said , " As your soul lives , O king , I can '@@ t tell . "
Saul said to him , " Wh@@ ose son are you , you young man ? " David answered , " I am the son of your servant Jes@@ se the Beth@@ le@@ hem@@ ite . "
David went out wherever Saul sent him , and behaved himself wisely : and Saul set him over the men of war , and it was good in the sight of all the people , and also in the sight of Saul 's servants .
Saul was very angry , and this saying dis@@ pleased him ; and he said , " They have ascri@@ bed to David ten thousands , and to me they have ascri@@ bed but thousands . what can he have more but the kingdom ? "
and Saul threw the spe@@ ar ; for he said , " I will pin David even to the wall ! " David escaped from his presence twice .
therefore Saul removed him from him , and made him his captain over a thousand ; and he went out and came in before the people .
but it happened at the time when Mer@@ ab , Saul 's daughter , should have been given to David , that she was given to Adri@@ el the Me@@ hol@@ ath@@ ite as wife .
Saul said , " You shall tell David , ' The king desires no d@@ ow@@ ry except one hundred fores@@ kins of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , to be av@@ eng@@ ed of the king 's enemies . ' " now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are , and I will talk with my father about you ; and if I see anything , I will tell you . "
Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father , and said to him , " Don '@@ t let the king sin against his servant , against David ; because he has not sin@@ ned against you , and because his works have been very good toward you ;
Saul sought to pin David even to the wall with the spe@@ ar ; but he slipped away out of Saul 's presence , and he stuck the spe@@ ar into the wall . David fled , and escaped that night .
Saul sent messengers to David 's house , to watch him , and to kill him in the morning . Mic@@ h@@ al , David 's wife , told him , saying , " If you don '@@ t save your life tonight , tomorrow you will be killed . "
when the messengers came in , behold , the ter@@ ap@@ him was in the bed , with the pillow of goats ' hair at its head .
Saul said to Mic@@ h@@ al , " Why have you deceived me thus , and let my enemy go , so that he is escaped ? " Mic@@ h@@ al answered Saul , " He said to me , ' Let me go ! why should I kill you ? ' "
then went he also to Ram@@ ah , and came to the great well that is in Sec@@ u : and he asked , " Where are Samuel and David ? " one said , " Be@@ hold , they are at Nai@@ o@@ th in Ram@@ ah . "
he also stripped off his clothes , and he also prophe@@ si@@ ed before Samuel , and lay down naked all that day and all that night . therefore they say , " Is Saul also among the prophets ? "
David fled from Nai@@ o@@ th in Ram@@ ah , and came and said before Jonathan , " What have I done ? what is my ini@@ qu@@ ity ? what is my sin before your father , that he seeks my life ? "
then Jonathan said to David , " Wh@@ at@@ ever your soul desires , I will even do it for you . "
David said to Jonathan , " Be@@ hold , tomorrow is the new moon , and I should not fail to dine with the king ; but let me go , that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening .
if your father miss me at all , then say , ' David ear@@ ne@@ stly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city ; for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family . '
Jonathan caused David to swear again , for the love that he had to him ; for he loved him as he loved his own soul .
when you have stayed three days , you shall go down quickly , and come to the place where you hid yourself when this started , and shall remain by the stone E@@ z@@ el .
but if I say this to the boy , ' Be@@ hold , the arrows are beyond you ; ' then go your way ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has sent you away .
the king sat on his seat , as at other times , even on the seat by the wall ; and Jonathan stood up , and Ab@@ ner sat by Saul 's side : but David 's place was empty .
nevertheless Saul did@@ n '@@ t say anything that day : for he thought , " Some@@ thing has happened to him . he is not clean . surely he is not clean . "
it happened on the next day after the new moon , the second day , that David 's place was empty . Saul said to Jonathan his son , " Why do@@ es@@ n '@@ t the son of Jes@@ se come to eat , neither yesterday , nor today ? "
then Saul 's anger was kind@@ led against Jonathan , and he said to him , " You son of a perverse rebelli@@ ous woman , don '@@ t I know that you have chosen the son of Jes@@ se to your own shame , and to the shame of your mother 's n@@ ak@@ edness ?
when the boy had come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot , Jonathan cried after the boy , and said , " is@@ n '@@ t the arrow beyond you ? "
Jonathan cried after the boy , " Go fast ! hurry ! Don '@@ t delay ! " Jonathan 's boy gathered up the arrows , and came to his master .
as soon as the boy was gone , David arose out of the south , and fell on his face to the ground , and bowed himself three times . they kis@@ sed one another , and we@@ pt one with another , and David we@@ pt the most .
now therefore what is under your hand ? give me five lo@@ aves of bread in my hand , or whatever there is present . "
the priest answered David , and said , " There is no common bread under my hand , but there is holy bread ; if only the young men have kept themselves from women . "
so the priest gave him holy bread ; for there was no bread there but the show bread , that was taken from before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away .
the servants of Ach@@ ish said to him , " is@@ n '@@ t this David the king of the land ? did@@ n '@@ t they sing one to another about him in dances , saying , ' Saul has sl@@ ain his thousands , David his ten thousands ? ' "
he changed his behavior before them , and pre@@ tended to be mad in their hands , and sc@@ rab@@ bled on the doors of the gate , and let his sp@@ ittle fall down on his beard .
then Ach@@ ish said to his servants , " Look , you see the man is mad . why then have you brought him to me ?
David therefore departed there , and escaped to the cave of Ad@@ ul@@ lam . when his brothers and all his father 's house heard it , they went down there to him .
everyone who was in distress , and everyone who was in debt , and everyone who was dis@@ cont@@ ented , gathered themselves to him ; and he became captain over them : and there were with him about four hundred men .
David went there to M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of Mo@@ ab , and he said to the king of Mo@@ ab , " Please let my father and my mother come out with you , until I know what God will do for me . "
the prophet G@@ ad said to David , " Don '@@ t stay in the strongh@@ old . depart , and go into the land of Jud@@ ah . " then David departed , and came into the forest of Her@@ eth .
Saul heard that David was discovered , and the men who were with him . now Saul was sitting in Gi@@ be@@ ah , under the tam@@ ar@@ isk tree in Ram@@ ah , with his spe@@ ar in his hand , and all his servants were standing about him .
Saul said to his servants who stood about him , " He@@ ar now , you Ben@@ jam@@ ites ! will the son of Jes@@ se give everyone of you fields and vineyards , will he make you all cap@@ tains of thousands and cap@@ tains of hundreds ,
then Do@@ eg the E@@ dom@@ ite , who stood by the servants of Saul , answered and said , " I saw the son of Jes@@ se coming to No@@ b , to A@@ him@@ elec@@ h the son of Ah@@ it@@ u@@ b .
then the king sent to call A@@ him@@ elec@@ h the priest , the son of Ah@@ it@@ u@@ b , and all his father 's house , the priests who were in No@@ b : and they came all of them to the king .
Saul said , " He@@ ar now , you son of Ah@@ it@@ u@@ b . " he answered , " Here I am , my lord . "
then A@@ him@@ elec@@ h answered the king , and said , " Who among all your servants is so faithful as David , who is the king 's son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , and is taken into your council , and is honorable in your house ?
the king said to Do@@ eg , " Turn and attack the priests ! " Do@@ eg the E@@ dom@@ ite turned , and he attacked the priests , and he killed on that day eighty @@@ -@@ @ five people who wore a linen ep@@ ho@@ d .
he struck No@@ b , the city of the priests , with the edge of the sword , both men and women , children and nursing babies , and cattle and don@@ keys and sheep , with the edge of the sword .
David said to A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar , " I knew on that day , when Do@@ eg the E@@ dom@@ ite was there , that he would surely tell Saul . I am responsible for the death of all the persons of your father 's house .
David was told , " Be@@ hold , the Phil@@ ist@@ ines are fighting against Ke@@ il@@ ah , and are rob@@ bing the thresh@@ ing floors . "
David 's men said to him , " Be@@ hold , we are afraid here in Jud@@ ah : how much more then if we go to Ke@@ il@@ ah against the armies of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ? "
then David inqui@@ red of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h yet again . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h answered him , and said , " A@@ rise , go down to Ke@@ il@@ ah ; for I will deliver the Phil@@ ist@@ ines into your hand . "
it happened , when A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the son of A@@ him@@ elec@@ h fled to David to Ke@@ il@@ ah , that he came down with an ep@@ ho@@ d in his hand .
it was told Saul that David had come to Ke@@ il@@ ah . Saul said , " God has delivered him into my hand ; for he is shut in , by entering into a town that has gates and bars . "
then David said , " O Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Ke@@ il@@ ah , to destroy the city for my sake .
will the men of Ke@@ il@@ ah deliver me up into his hand ? will Saul come down , as your servant has heard ? Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , I beg you , tell your servant . " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , " He will come down . "
then David said , " Will the men of Ke@@ il@@ ah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul ? " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , " They will deliver you up . "
then David and his men , who were about six hundred , arose and departed out of Ke@@ il@@ ah , and went wherever they could go . it was told Saul that David was escaped from Ke@@ il@@ ah ; and he gave up going there .
David stayed in the wilderness in the strongh@@ olds , and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Zi@@ ph . Saul sought him every day , but God did@@ n '@@ t deliver him into his hand .
he said to him , " Don '@@ t be afraid ; for the hand of Saul my father shall not find you ; and you shall be king over Israel , and I shall be next to you ; and that also Saul my father knows . "
then the Zi@@ ph@@ ites came up to Saul to Gi@@ be@@ ah , saying , " do@@ es@@ n '@@ t David hide himself with us in the strongh@@ olds in the wood , in the hill of H@@ ach@@ il@@ ah , which is on the south of the desert ?
they arose , and went to Zi@@ ph before Saul : but David and his men were in the wilderness of Ma@@ on , in the Arab@@ ah on the south of the desert .
but a messenger came to Saul , saying , " Hur@@ ry and come ; for the Phil@@ ist@@ ines have made a raid on the land ! "
it happened , when Saul was returned from following the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , that it was told him , saying , " Be@@ hold , David is in the wilderness of E@@ n G@@ ed@@ i . "
it came to pass , when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul , that Saul said , " Is this your voice , my son David ? " Saul lifted up his voice , and we@@ pt .
swear now therefore to me by Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that you will not cut off my seed after me , and that you will not destroy my name out of my father 's house . "
David s@@ wore to Saul . Saul went home ; but David and his men went up to the strongh@@ old .
there was a man in Ma@@ on , whose possessions were in Car@@ me@@ l ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand sheep , and a thousand goats : and he was sh@@ earing his sheep in Car@@ me@@ l .
now the name of the man was Nab@@ al ; and the name of his wife Ab@@ ig@@ ail ; and the woman was of good understanding , and of a beautiful face : but the man was chur@@ lish and evil in his do@@ ings ; and he was of the house of Cal@@ eb .
David sent ten young men , and David said to the young men , " Go up to Car@@ me@@ l , and go to Nab@@ al , and greet him in my name .
shall I then take my bread , and my water , and my meat that I have killed for my sh@@ ear@@ ers , and give it to men who I don '@@ t know where they come from ? "
now therefore know and consider what you will do ; for evil is determined against our master , and against all his house ; for he is such a worthless fellow that one can '@@ t speak to him . "
then Ab@@ ig@@ ail hur@@ ried and took two hundred lo@@ aves of bread , two bottles of wine , five sheep ready dressed , five measures of par@@ ched grain , one hundred clusters of ra@@ is@@ ins , and two hundred cakes of fi@@ gs , and laid them on don@@ keys .
she said to her young men , " Go on before me . behold , I come after you . " but she did@@ n '@@ t tell her husband , Nab@@ al .
it was so , as she rode on her don@@ key , and came down by the covert of the mountain , that behold , David and his men came down toward her ; and she met them .
now David had said , " Su@@ rely in vain have I kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness , so that nothing was missed of all that per@@ tained to him . he has returned me evil for good .
when Ab@@ ig@@ ail saw David , she hur@@ ried , and ali@@ ghted from her don@@ key , and fell before David on her face , and bowed herself to the ground .
she fell at his feet , and said , " On me , my lord , on me be the ini@@ qu@@ ity ; and please let your hand@@ maid speak in your ears . hear the words of your hand@@ maid .
please forgive the t@@ resp@@ ass of your hand@@ maid . for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will certainly make my lord a sure house , because my lord fights the battles of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and evil shall not be found in you all your days .
David said to Ab@@ ig@@ ail , " Bless@@ ed is Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , who sent you this day to meet me !
so David received of her hand that which she had brought him : and he said to her , " Go up in peace to your house . behold , I have listened to your voice , and have granted your request . "
it happened in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nab@@ al , that his wife told him these things , and his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
when the servants of David had come to Ab@@ ig@@ ail to Car@@ me@@ l , they spoke to her , saying , " David has sent us to you , to take you to him as wife . "
she arose , and bowed herself with her face to the earth , and said , " Be@@ hold , your hand@@ maid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord . "
Ab@@ ig@@ ail hur@@ ried , and arose , and rode on a don@@ key , with five ladies of hers who followed her ; and she went after the messengers of David , and became his wife .
then Saul arose , and went down to the wilderness of Zi@@ ph , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the wilderness of Zi@@ ph .
Saul enc@@ amped in the hill of H@@ ach@@ il@@ ah , which is before the desert , by the way . but David stayed in the wilderness , and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness .
David arose , and came to the place where Saul had enc@@ amped ; and David saw the place where Saul lay , and Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , the captain of his army : and Saul lay within the place of the w@@ agons , and the people were enc@@ amped around him .
then answered David and said to A@@ him@@ elec@@ h the Hit@@ tite , and to Ab@@ is@@ hai the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , brother to Jo@@ ab , saying , " Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp ? " Ab@@ is@@ hai said , " I will go down with you . "
so David and Ab@@ is@@ hai came to the people by night : and , behold , Saul lay sleeping within the place of the w@@ agons , with his spe@@ ar stuck in the ground at his head ; and Ab@@ ner and the people lay around him .
David said to Ab@@ is@@ hai , " Don '@@ t destroy him ; for who can put forth his hand against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's ano@@ inted , and be guil@@ tless ? "
then David went over to the other side , and stood on the top of the mountain af@@ ar off ; a great space being between them ;
and David cried to the people , and to Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , saying , " Don '@@ t you answer , Ab@@ ner ? " then Ab@@ ner answered , " Who are you who cries to the king ? "
David said to Ab@@ ner , " are@@ n '@@ t you a man ? who is like you in Israel ? why then have you not kept watch over your lord , the king ? for one of the people came in to destroy the king your lord .
this thing is@@ n '@@ t good that you have done . as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , you are worthy to die , because you have not kept watch over your lord , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's ano@@ inted . now see where the king 's spe@@ ar is , and the jar of water that was at his head . "
Saul knew David 's voice , and said , " Is this your voice , my son David ? " David said , " It is my voice , my lord , O king . "
behold , as your life was respected this day in my eyes , so let my life be respected in the eyes of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and let him deliver me out of all oppression . "
then Saul said to David , " You are blessed , my son David . you shall both do mi@@ gh@@ tily , and shall surely prevail . " so David went his way , and Saul returned to his place .
David arose , and passed over , he and the six hundred men who were with him , to Ach@@ ish the son of Ma@@ o@@ ch , king of G@@ ath .
Ach@@ ish said , " Against whom have you made a raid today ? " David said , " Against the South of Jud@@ ah , against the South of the Jer@@ ah@@ me@@ elites , and against the South of the Ken@@ ites . "
Ach@@ ish believed David , saying , " He has made his people Israel utterly to abh@@ or him . therefore he shall be my servant forever . "
it happened in those days , that the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered their armies together for warfare , to fight with Israel . Ach@@ ish said to David , " Know assu@@ re@@ dly that you shall go out with me in the army , you and your men . "
Saul s@@ wore to her by Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , saying , " As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , no punishment shall happen to you for this thing . "
when the woman saw Samuel , she cried with a loud voice ; and the woman spoke to Saul , saying , " Why have you deceived me ? for you are Saul ! "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has done to you as he spoke by me . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has torn the kingdom out of your hand , and given it to your neighbor , even to David .
because you did@@ n '@@ t obey the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and did@@ n '@@ t execute his fierce wrath on A@@ mal@@ ek , therefore Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has done this thing to you this day .
moreover Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will deliver Israel also with you into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will deliver the army of Israel also into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
then Saul fell immediately his full length on the earth , and was terrified , because of the words of Samuel . there was no strength in him ; for he had eaten no bread all the day , nor all the night .
now therefore , please listen also to the voice of your hand@@ maid , and let me set a mor@@ sel of bread before you ; and eat , that you may have strength , when you go on your way . "
but he refused , and said , I will not eat . but his servants , together with the woman , constrained him ; and he listened to their voice . so he arose from the earth , and sat on the bed .
the woman had a f@@ atten@@ ed cal@@ f in the house . she hur@@ ried and killed it ; and she took flour , and kne@@ aded it , and baked un@@ leav@@ ened bread of it .
is not this David , of whom they sang one to another in dances , saying , ' Saul has sl@@ ain his thousands , David his ten thousands ? ' "
Ach@@ ish answered David , " I know that you are good in my sight , as an angel of God . notwithstanding the princes of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines have said , ' He shall not go up with us to the battle . '
therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you ; and as soon as you are up early in the morning , and have light , depart . "
so David rose up early , he and his men , to depart in the morning , to return into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went up to J@@ ez@@ re@@ el .
and had taken captive the women and all who were therein , both small and great . they did@@ n '@@ t kill any , but carried them off , and went their way .
so David went , he and the six hundred men who were with him , and came to the bro@@ ok Bes@@ or , where those who were left behind stayed .
but David pursued , he and four hundred men ; for two hundred stayed behind , who were so faint that they cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t go over the bro@@ ok Bes@@ or .
they gave him a piece of a cake of fi@@ gs , and two clusters of ra@@ isin@@ s. when he had eaten , his spirit came again to him ; for he had eaten no bread , nor drunk any water , three days and three nights .
David asked him , " To whom do you belong ? where are you from ? " he said , " I am a young man of Egypt , servant to an A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ite ; and my master left me , because three days ago I fell sick .
David struck them from the tw@@ ilight even to the evening of the next day . not a man of them escaped from there , except four hundred young men , who rode on cam@@ els and fled .
then David said , " You shall not do so , my brothers , with that which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has given to us , who has preserved us , and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand .
who will listen to you in this matter ? for as his share is who goes down to the battle , so shall his share be who tar@@ ries by the baggage : they shall share alike . "
when David came to Z@@ ik@@ lag , he sent of the spoil to the elders of Jud@@ ah , even to his friends , saying , " Be@@ hold , a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
now the Phil@@ ist@@ ines fought against Israel : and the men of Israel fled from before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and fell down sl@@ ain on Mount Gil@@ bo@@ a .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines followed hard on Saul and on his sons ; and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines killed Jonathan , and Ab@@ in@@ ad@@ ab , and Mal@@ ch@@ ish@@ ua , the sons of Saul .
when the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley , and those who were beyond the Jordan , saw that the men of Israel fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , they for@@ s@@ ook the cities , and fled ; and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came and lived in them .
it happened on the next day , when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came to strip the sl@@ ain , that they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gil@@ bo@@ a .
they cut off his head , and stripped off his armor , and sent into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines all around , to carry the news to the house of their idols , and to the people .
all the val@@ i@@ ant men arose , and went all night , and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of B@@ eth Sh@@ an ; and they came to Jab@@ esh , and burnt them there .
David said to him , " How did it go ? please tell me . " he answered , " The people have fled from the battle , and many of the people also have fallen and are dead ; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also . "
the young man who told him said , " As I happened by chance on Mount Gil@@ bo@@ a , behold , Saul was leaning on his spe@@ ar ; and behold , the ch@@ ari@@ ots and the hor@@ sem@@ en followed hard after him .
he said to me , ' Please stand beside me , and kill me ; for angu@@ ish has taken hold of me , because my life is yet whole in me . '
they mour@@ ned , and we@@ pt , and fast@@ ed until evening , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
Don '@@ t tell it in G@@ ath . Don '@@ t publish it in the streets of Ash@@ kel@@ on , lest the daughters of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines rejoice , lest the daughters of the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised triumph .
Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives . in their death , they were not divided . they were swif@@ ter than eag@@ les . they were stronger than lions .
I am distressed for you , my brother Jonathan . you have been very pleasant to me . your love to me was wonderful , passing the love of women .
it happened after this , that David inqui@@ red of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , saying , " Sh@@ all I go up into any of the cities of Jud@@ ah ? " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to him , " Go up . " David said , " Where shall I go up ? " he said , " To He@@ br@@ on . "
David sent messengers to the men of Jab@@ esh Gil@@ e@@ ad , and said to them , " Bless@@ ed are you by Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that you have shown this kindness to your lord , even to Saul , and have buried him .
now therefore let your hands be strong , and be val@@ i@@ ant ; for Saul your lord is dead , and also the house of Jud@@ ah have ano@@ inted me king over them . "
Ab@@ ner said to Jo@@ ab , " Please let the young men arise and play before us ! " Jo@@ ab said , " Let them arise ! "
then they arose and went over by number : twelve for Benjamin , and for I@@ sh@@ bos@@ h@@ eth the son of Saul , and twelve of the servants of David .
they each caught his opponent by the head , and thrust his sword in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : therefore that place was called Hel@@ k@@ ath H@@ azz@@ ur@@ im , which is in Gi@@ be@@ on .
the battle was very severe that day : and Ab@@ ner was beaten , and the men of Israel , before the servants of David .
then Ab@@ ner looked behind him , and said , " Is it you , As@@ ah@@ el ? " he answered , " It is I. "
Ab@@ ner said to him , " Turn aside to your right hand or to your left , and grab one of the young men , and take his armor . " but As@@ ah@@ el would not turn aside from following him .
but Jo@@ ab and Ab@@ is@@ hai pursued after Ab@@ ner : and the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Am@@ ma@@ h , that lies before Gi@@ ah by the way of the wilderness of Gi@@ be@@ on .
the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Ab@@ ner , and became one band , and stood on the top of a hill .
Jo@@ ab said , " As God lives , if you had not spoken , surely then in the morning the people would have gone away , and not each followed his brother . "
so Jo@@ ab blew the trum@@ pet ; and all the people stood still , and pursued after Israel no more , neither fought they any more .
Ab@@ ner and his men went all that night through the Arab@@ ah ; and they passed over the Jordan , and went through all Bi@@ thr@@ on , and came to Ma@@ han@@ aim .
Jo@@ ab returned from following Ab@@ ner : and when he had gathered all the people together , there lacked of David 's servants ninet@@ een men and As@@ ah@@ el .
they took up As@@ ah@@ el , and buried him in the tomb of his father , which was in Bethlehem . Jo@@ ab and his men went all night , and the day broke on them at He@@ br@@ on .
now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David : and David grew stronger and stronger , but the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker .
and the fourth , Ad@@ oni@@ jah the son of H@@ agg@@ ith ; and the fifth , Sh@@ eph@@ ati@@ ah the son of Ab@@ ital ;
and the sixth , I@@ thre@@ am , of E@@ g@@ lah , David 's wife . these were born to David in He@@ br@@ on .
now Saul had a conc@@ ub@@ ine , whose name was R@@ iz@@ pa@@ h , the daughter of Ai@@ ah : and I@@ sh@@ bos@@ h@@ eth said to Ab@@ ner , " Why have you gone in to my father 's conc@@ ub@@ ine ? "
Ab@@ ner sent messengers to David on his behalf , saying , " Wh@@ ose is the land ? " and saying , " Make your alliance with me , and behold , my hand shall be with you , to bring all Israel around to you . "
David sent messengers to I@@ sh@@ bos@@ h@@ eth , Saul 's son , saying , " Deli@@ ver me my wife Mic@@ h@@ al , whom I pledged to be married to me for one hundred fores@@ kins of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . "
her husband went with her , we@@ eping as he went , and followed her to Bah@@ ur@@ im . then Ab@@ ner said to him , " Go ! return ! " and he returned .
Ab@@ ner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin : and Ab@@ ner went also to speak in the ears of David in He@@ br@@ on all that seemed good to Israel , and to the whole house of Benjamin .
behold , the servants of David and Jo@@ ab came from a for@@ ay , and brought in a great spoil with them : but Ab@@ ner was not with David in He@@ br@@ on ; for he had sent him away , and he was gone in peace .
when Jo@@ ab and all the army who was with him had come , they told Jo@@ ab , saying , Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er came to the king , and he has sent him away , and he is gone in peace .
then Jo@@ ab came to the king , and said , " What have you done ? behold , Ab@@ ner came to you . why is it that you have sent him away , and he is quite gone ?
you know Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , that he came to deceive you , and to know your going out and your coming in , and to know all that you do . "
afterward , when David heard it , he said , " I and my kingdom are guil@@ tless before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h forever of the blood of Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er .
they buried Ab@@ ner in He@@ br@@ on : and the king lifted up his voice , and we@@ pt at the grave of Ab@@ ner ; and all the people we@@ pt .
the king said to his servants , " Don '@@ t you know that there a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel ?
Saul 's son had two men who were cap@@ tains of bands : the name of the one was Ba@@ an@@ ah , and the name of the other Rec@@ hab , the sons of Rim@@ mon the Be@@ ero@@ th@@ ite , of the children of Benjamin ( for Be@@ ero@@ th also is reck@@ oned to Benjamin :
the sons of Rim@@ mon the Be@@ ero@@ th@@ ite , Rec@@ hab and Ba@@ an@@ ah , went , and came about the heat of the day to the house of I@@ sh@@ bos@@ h@@ eth , as he took his rest at noon .
they came there into the midst of the house , as though they would have fetched wheat ; and they struck him in the body : and Rec@@ hab and Ba@@ an@@ ah his brother escaped .
David answered Rec@@ hab and Ba@@ an@@ ah his brother , the sons of Rim@@ mon the Be@@ ero@@ th@@ ite , and said to them , " As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , who has re@@ deemed my soul out of all ad@@ versity ,
how much more , when wicked men have sl@@ ain a righteous person in his own house on his bed , shall I not now require his blood of your hand , and take you away from the earth ? "
David commanded his young men , and they killed them , and cut off their hands and their feet , and han@@ ged them up beside the pool in He@@ br@@ on . but they took the head of I@@ sh@@ bos@@ h@@ eth , and buried it in the grave of Ab@@ ner in He@@ br@@ on .
then came all the tribes of Israel to David to He@@ br@@ on , and spoke , saying , " Be@@ hold , we are your bone and your flesh .
in times past , when Saul was king over us , it was you who led out and brought in Israel . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to you , ' You shall be shepherd of my people Israel , and you shall be prince over Israel . ' "
when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard that they had ano@@ inted David king over Israel , all the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went up to seek David ; and David heard of it , and went down to the strongh@@ old .
David inqui@@ red of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , saying , " Sh@@ all I go up against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ? will you deliver them into my hand ? " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to David , " Go up ; for I will certainly deliver the Phil@@ ist@@ ines into your hand . "
David came to Ba@@ al Per@@ az@@ im , and David struck them there ; and he said , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has broken my enemies before me , like the breach of waters . " therefore he called the name of that place Ba@@ al Per@@ az@@ im .
David arose , and went with all the people who were with him , from Ba@@ ale Jud@@ ah , to bring up from there the ark of God , which is called by the Name , even the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies who sits above the cher@@ ub@@ im .
they set the ark of God on a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Ab@@ in@@ ad@@ ab that was in the hill : and Uz@@ z@@ ah and A@@ hio , the sons of Ab@@ in@@ ad@@ ab , drove the new cart .
when they came to the thresh@@ ing floor of N@@ acon , Uz@@ z@@ ah reached for the ark of God , and took hold of it ; for the cattle stum@@ bled .
David was afraid of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h that day ; and he said , " How shall the ark of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h come to me ? "
the ark of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h remained in the house of O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom the G@@ it@@ tite three months : and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h blessed O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom , and all his house .
it was so , as the ark of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came into the city of David , that Mic@@ h@@ al the daughter of Saul looked out at the window , and saw king David le@@ aping and dancing before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and she desp@@ ised him in her heart .
they brought in the ark of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and set it in its place , in the midst of the tent that David had pit@@ ched for it ; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
David said to Mic@@ h@@ al , " It was before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , who chose me above your father , and above all his house , to appoint me prince over the people of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , over Israel . therefore will I celebrate before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
I will be yet more v@@ ile than this , and will be base in my own sight . but of the hand@@ m@@ aids of whom you have spoken , they shall honor me . "
it happened , when the king lived in his house , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had given him rest from all his enemies all around ,
" go and tell my servant David , ' Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " Sh@@ all you build me a house for me to dwell in ?
for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have moved around in a tent and in a tab@@ ern@@ acle .
I have been with you wherever you went , and have cut off all your enemies from before you . I will make you a great name , like the name of the great ones who are in the earth .
when your days are fulfilled , and you shall sleep with your fathers , I will set up your seed after you , who shall proceed out of your bow@@ els , and I will establish his kingdom .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . if he commits ini@@ qu@@ ity , I will cha@@ sten him with the rod of men , and with the stri@@ pes of the children of men ;
for your word 's sake , and according to your own heart , you have worked all this greatness , to make your servant know it .
for you , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , the God of Israel , have revealed to your servant , saying , ' I will build you a house . ' therefore your servant has found in his heart to pray this prayer to you .
he struck Mo@@ ab , and measured them with the line , making them to lie down on the ground ; and he measured two lines to put to death , and one full line to keep alive . the Mo@@ ab@@ ites became servants to David , and brought tribute .
of Syria , and of Mo@@ ab , and of the children of Am@@ mon , and of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and of A@@ mal@@ ek , and of the spoil of Had@@ ad@@ ez@@ er , son of Re@@ ho@@ b , king of Z@@ ob@@ ah .
David earned a reputation when he returned from sm@@ iting the Syrians in the Valley of Salt , even eighteen thousand men .
David said , " Is there yet any who is left of the house of Saul , that I may show him kindness for Jonathan 's sake ? "
there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Zi@@ ba , and they called him to David ; and the king said to him , " Are you Zi@@ ba ? " he said , " Your servant is he . "
the king said , " Is there not yet any of the house of Saul , that I may show the kindness of God to him ? " Zi@@ ba said to the king , " Jonathan has yet a son , who is lame of his feet . "
the king said to him , " Where is he ? " Zi@@ ba said to the king , " Be@@ hold , he is in the house of Mach@@ ir the son of Am@@ mi@@ el , in L@@ o deb@@ ar . "
M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth , the son of Jonathan , the son of Saul , came to David , and fell on his face , and showed respect . David said , " M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth . " he answered , " Be@@ hold , your servant ! "
David said to him , " Don '@@ t be afraid of him ; for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father 's sake , and will restore to you all the land of Saul your father . you shall eat bread at my table continually . "
he bowed down , and said , " What is your servant , that you should look on such a dead dog as I am ? "
then the king called to Zi@@ ba , Saul 's servant , and said to him , " All that per@@ tained to Saul and to all his house have I given to your master 's son .
then Zi@@ ba said to the king , " According to all that my lord the king commands his servant , so your shall servant do . " so M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth ate at the king 's table , like one of the king 's sons .
David said , " I will show kindness to H@@ anu@@ n the son of N@@ ah@@ ash , as his father showed kindness to me . " so David sent by his servants to comfort him concerning his father . David 's servants came into the land of the children of Am@@ mon .
so H@@ anu@@ n took David 's servants , and sha@@ ved off the one half of their be@@ ards , and cut off their garments in the middle , even to their but@@ to@@ cks , and sent them away .
when the children of Am@@ mon saw that they were become o@@ dious to David , the children of Am@@ mon sent and hired the Syrians of B@@ eth Re@@ ho@@ b , and the Syrians of Z@@ ob@@ ah , twenty thousand foot@@ men , and the king of Ma@@ ac@@ ah with one thousand men , and the men of To@@ b twelve thousand men .
he said , " If the Syrians are too strong for me , then you shall help me ; but if the children of Am@@ mon are too strong for you , then I will come and help you .
be courageous , and let us be strong for our people , and for the cities of our God ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h do that which seems good to him . "
when the children of Am@@ mon saw that the Syrians had fled , they likewise fled before Ab@@ is@@ hai , and entered into the city . then Jo@@ ab returned from the children of Am@@ mon , and came to Jerusalem .
Had@@ ad@@ ez@@ er sent , and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River : and they came to Hel@@ am , with Sho@@ bach the captain of the army of Had@@ ad@@ ez@@ er at their head .
it was told David ; and he gathered all Israel together , and passed over the Jordan , and came to Hel@@ am . the Syrians set themselves in array against David , and fought with him .
the Syrians fled before Israel ; and David killed of the Syrians seven hundred ch@@ ari@@ o@@ te@@ ers , and forty thousand hor@@ sem@@ en , and struck Sho@@ bach the captain of their army , so that he died there .
when all the kings who were servants to Had@@ ad@@ ez@@ er saw that they were defeated before Israel , they made peace with Israel , and served them . so the Syrians feared to help the children of Am@@ mon any more .
David sent and inqui@@ red after the woman . one said , " is@@ n '@@ t this Bath@@ she@@ ba , the daughter of Eli@@ am , the wife of Uri@@ ah the Hit@@ tite ? "
David sent messengers , and took her ; and she came in to him , and he lay with her ( for she was purified from her un@@ clean@@ ness ) ; and she returned to her house .
the woman conceived ; and she sent and told David , and said , " I am with child . "
David said to Uri@@ ah , " Go down to your house , and wash your feet . " Uri@@ ah departed out of the king 's house , and a gift from the king was sent after him .
but Uri@@ ah slept at the door of the king 's house with all the servants of his lord , and did@@ n '@@ t go down to his house .
when they had told David , saying , " Uri@@ ah did@@ n '@@ t go down to his house , " David said to Uri@@ ah , " Hav@@ en '@@ t you come from a journey ? why did@@ n '@@ t you go down to your house ? "
when David had called him , he ate and drink before him ; and he made him drunk . at evening , he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord , but did@@ n '@@ t go down to his house .
the men of the city went out , and fought with Jo@@ ab . some of the people fell , even of the servants of David ; and Uri@@ ah the Hit@@ tite died also .
it shall be that , if the king 's wrath arise , and he asks you , ' Why did you go so near to the city to fight ? did@@ n '@@ t you know that they would shoot from the wall ?
so the messenger went , and came and showed David all that Jo@@ ab had sent him for .
the messenger said to David , " The men prevailed against us , and came out to us into the field , and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate .
the shooters shot at your servants from off the wall ; and some of the king 's servants are dead , and your servant Uri@@ ah the Hit@@ tite is dead also . "
then David said to the messenger , " Th@@ us you shall tell Jo@@ ab , ' Don '@@ t let this thing dis@@ please you , for the sword dev@@ ours one as well as another . make your battle stronger against the city , and overthrow it . ' encourage him . "
Na@@ than said to David , " You are the man . this is what Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , says : ' I ano@@ inted you king over Israel , and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul .
I gave you your master 's house , and your master 's wives into your bos@@ om , and gave you the house of Israel and of Jud@@ ah ; and if that would have been too little , I would have added to you many more such things .
" this is what Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h says : ' behold , I will raise up evil against you out of your own house ; and I will take your wives before your eyes , and give them to your neighbor , and he will lie with your wives in the sight of this sun .
but when David saw that his servants were whis@@ pering together , David perceived that the child was dead ; and David said to his servants , " Is the child dead ? " they said , " He is dead . "
then David arose from the earth , and washed , and ano@@ inted himself , and changed his clothing ; and he came into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and worshi@@ ped : then he came to his own house ; and when he required , they set bread before him , and he ate .
then his servants said to him , " What is this that you have done ? you fast@@ ed and we@@ pt for the child while he was alive ; but when the child was dead , you rose up and ate bread . "
he said , " While the child was yet alive , I fast@@ ed and we@@ pt ; for I said , ' Who knows whether Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will not be gr@@ acious to me , that the child may live ? '
now therefore gather the rest of the people together , and enc@@ amp against the city , and take it ; lest I take the city , and it be called after my name . "
he took the crown of their king from off his head ; and its weight was a talent of gold , and in it were precious stones ; and it was set on David 's head . he brought out the spoil of the city , exceeding much .
he said to him , " Why , son of the king , are you so sad from day to day ? won '@@ t you tell me ? " Am@@ non said to him , " I love Tam@@ ar , my brother Ab@@ sal@@ om 's sister . "
she took the pan , and poured them out before him ; but he refused to eat . Am@@ non said , " Have all men leave me . " every man went out from him .
she answered him , " No , my brother , do not force me ! for no such thing ought to be done in Israel . Don '@@ t you do this folly .
I , where would I carry my shame ? and as for you , you will be as one of the fo@@ ols in Israel . now therefore , please speak to the king ; for he will not with@@ hold me from you . "
then Am@@ non hated her with exceeding great hatred ; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her . Am@@ non said to her , " A@@ rise , be gone ! "
she said to him , " Not so , because this great wrong in sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me ! " but he would not listen to her .
then he called his servant who minist@@ ered to him , and said , " P@@ ut now this woman out from me , and bolt the door after her . "
she had a garment of various colors on her ; for with such robes were the king 's daughters who were vir@@ gins dressed . then his servant brought her out , and bol@@ ted the door after her .
Tam@@ ar put ashes on her head , and t@@ ore her garment of various colors that was on her ; and she laid her hand on her head , and went her way , crying aloud as she went .
the servants of Ab@@ sal@@ om did to Am@@ non as Ab@@ sal@@ om had commanded . then all the king 's sons arose , and every man got up on his mu@@ le , and fled .
it happened , while they were in the way , that the news came to David , saying , " Ab@@ sal@@ om has sl@@ ain all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left ! "
now therefore don '@@ t let my lord the king take the thing to his heart , to think that all the king 's sons are dead ; for Am@@ non only is dead . "
it happened , as soon as he had finished speaking , that behold , the king 's sons came , and lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt . the king also and all his servants we@@ pt bit@@ terly .
King David long@@ ed to go forth to Ab@@ sal@@ om : for he was comfor@@ ted concerning Am@@ non , since he was dead .
when the woman of Te@@ ko@@ a spoke to the king , she fell on her face to the ground , showed respect , and said , " Help , O king ! "
the king said to her , " What ails you ? " she answered , " Tru@@ ly I am a widow , and my husband is dead .
your hand@@ maid had two sons , and they both fought together in the field , and there was no one to part them , but the one struck the other , and killed him .
the woman of Te@@ ko@@ a said to the king , " My lord , O king , the ini@@ qu@@ ity be on me , and on my father 's house ; and the king and his throne be guil@@ tless . "
then she said , " Please let the king remember Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , that the Av@@ enger of blood destroy not any more , lest they destroy my son . " he said , " As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , not one hair of your son shall fall to the earth . "
for we must die , and are as water split on the ground , which can '@@ t be gathered up again ; neither does God take away life , but dev@@ ises means , that he who is ban@@ ished not be an out@@ cast from him .
for the king will hear , to deliver his servant out of the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God .
then your hand@@ maid said , ' Please let the word of my lord the king bring rest ; for as an angel of God , so is my lord the king to discern good and bad . may Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , your God , be with you . ' "
then the king answered the woman , " Please don '@@ t hide anything from me that I ask you . " the woman said , " Let my lord the king now speak . "
to change the face of the matter has your servant Jo@@ ab done this thing . my lord is wise , according to the wisdom of an angel of God , to know all things that are in the earth . "
the king said to Jo@@ ab , " Be@@ hold now , I have done this thing . go therefore , bring the young man Ab@@ sal@@ om back . "
Jo@@ ab fell to the ground on his face , showed respect , and blessed the king . Jo@@ ab said , " Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight , my lord , king , in that the king has performed the request of his servant . "
the king said , " Let him return to his own house , but let him not see my face . " so Ab@@ sal@@ om returned to his own house , and did@@ n '@@ t see the king 's face .
now in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Ab@@ sal@@ om for his beauty : from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no bl@@ emish in him .
to Ab@@ sal@@ om there were born three sons , and one daughter , whose name was Tam@@ ar : she was a woman of a beautiful face .
then Jo@@ ab arose , and came to Ab@@ sal@@ om to his house , and said to him , " Why have your servants set my field on fire ? "
so Jo@@ ab came to the king , and told him ; and when he had called for Ab@@ sal@@ om , he came to the king , and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king kis@@ sed Ab@@ sal@@ om .
Ab@@ sal@@ om did this sort of thing to all Israel who came to the king for judgment . so Ab@@ sal@@ om stole the hearts of the men of Israel .
it happened at the end of forty years , that Ab@@ sal@@ om said to the king , " Please let me go and pay my vo@@ w , which I have vowed to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , in He@@ br@@ on .
for your servant vowed a vo@@ w while I stayed at G@@ es@@ hu@@ r in Syria , saying , ' If Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall indeed bring me again to Jerusalem , then I will serve Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . ' "
Ab@@ sal@@ om sent for A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el the Gil@@ on@@ ite , David 's counsel@@ or , from his city , even from Gil@@ oh , while he was offering the sacrifices . the conspiracy was strong ; for the people increased continually with Ab@@ sal@@ om .
a messenger came to David , saying , " The hearts of the men of Israel are after Ab@@ sal@@ om . "
the king 's servants said to the king , " Be@@ hold , your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king chooses . "
then the king said to It@@ tai the G@@ it@@ tite , " Why do you also go with us ? return , and stay with the king ; for you are a foreigner , and also an exile . return to your own place .
whereas you came but yesterday , should I this day make you go up and down with us , since I go where I may ? return , and take back your brothers . mercy and truth be with you . "
It@@ tai answered the king , and said , " As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , and as my lord the king lives , surely in what place my lord the king shall is , whether for death or for life , even there also will your servant be . "
all the country we@@ pt with a loud voice , and all the people passed over : the king also himself passed over the bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and all the people passed over , toward the way of the wilderness .
behold , Z@@ ad@@ ok also came , and all the Lev@@ ites with him , bearing the ark of the covenant of God ; and they set down the ark of God ; and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar went up , until all the people finished passing out of the city .
the king said to Z@@ ad@@ ok , " Car@@ ry back the ark of God into the city . if I find favor in the eyes of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , he will bring me again , and show me both it , and his hab@@ itation ;
someone told David , saying , " A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el is among the conspir@@ ators with Ab@@ sal@@ om . " David said , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , please turn the counsel of A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el into fool@@ is@@ hness . "
behold , they have there with them their two sons , A@@ him@@ a@@ az , Z@@ ad@@ ok 's son , and Jonathan , A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar 's son ; and by them you shall send to me everything that you shall hear . "
when David was a little past the top , behold , Zi@@ ba the servant of M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth met him , with a couple of don@@ keys sadd@@ led , and on them two hundred lo@@ aves of bread , and one hundred clusters of ra@@ is@@ ins , and one hundred summer fruits , and a bottle of wine .
the king said , " Where is your master 's son ? " Zi@@ ba said to the king , " Be@@ hold , he is staying in Jerusalem ; for he said , ' Today the house of Israel will restore me the kingdom of my father . ' "
then the king said to Zi@@ ba , " Be@@ hold , all that per@@ tains to M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth is yours . " Zi@@ ba said , " I do obe@@ is@@ ance . let me find favor in your sight , my lord , O king . "
he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David , and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left .
Shim@@ ei said when he cur@@ sed , " Be gone , be gone , you man of blood , and base fellow !
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has returned on you all the blood of the house of Saul , in whose place you have re@@ igned ! Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Ab@@ sal@@ om your son ! behold , you are caught by your own mis@@ chief , because you are a man of blood ! "
then Ab@@ is@@ hai the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah said to the king , " Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king ? please let me go over and take off his head . "
the king said , " What have I to do with you , you sons of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah ? because he cur@@ ses , and because Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has said to him , ' Cur@@ se David ; ' who then shall say , ' Why have you done so ? ' "
Ab@@ sal@@ om , and all the people , the men of Israel , came to Jerusalem , and A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el with him .
it happened , when Hus@@ hai the Arch@@ ite , David 's friend , had come to Ab@@ sal@@ om , that Hus@@ hai said to Ab@@ sal@@ om , " Long live the king ! long live the king ! "
Hus@@ hai said to Ab@@ sal@@ om , " No ; but wh@@ om@@ ever Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and this people , and all the men of Israel have chosen , his will I be , and with him I will stay .
A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el said to Ab@@ sal@@ om , " Go in to your father 's conc@@ ub@@ ines , that he has left to keep the house . then all Israel will hear that you are ab@@ hor@@ red by your father . then the hands of all who are with you will be strong . "
and I will bring back all the people to you . the man whom you seek is as if all returned . all the people shall be in peace . "
even he who is val@@ i@@ ant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , will utterly melt ; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man , and those who are with him are val@@ i@@ ant men .
but I counsel that all Israel be gathered together to you , from Dan even to Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba , as the sand that is by the sea for multitude ; and that you go to battle in your own person .
moreover , if he be gone into a city , then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city , and we will draw it into the river , until there is@@ n '@@ t one small stone found there . "
then Hus@@ hai said to Z@@ ad@@ ok and to A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the priests , " A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el counsel@@ ed Ab@@ sal@@ om and the elders of Israel that way ; and I have counsel@@ ed this way .
now therefore send quickly , and tell David , saying , ' Don '@@ t lodge this night at the For@@ ds of the wilderness , but by all means pass over ; lest the king be swallowed up , and all the people who are with him . ' "
now Jonathan and A@@ him@@ a@@ az were staying by E@@ n Rog@@ el ; and a female servant used to go and tell them ; and they went and told king David . for they might not be seen to come into the city .
but a boy saw them , and told Ab@@ sal@@ om . then they both went away quickly , and came to the house of a man in Bah@@ ur@@ im , who had a well in his court ; and they went down there .
Ab@@ sal@@ om 's servants came to the woman to the house ; and they said , " Where are A@@ him@@ a@@ az and Jonathan ? " the woman said to them , " They have gone over the bro@@ ok of water . " when they had sought and could not find them , they returned to Jerusalem .
it happened , after they had departed , that they came up out of the well , and went and told king David ; and they said to David , " A@@ rise and pass quickly over the water ; for thus has A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el counsel@@ ed against you . "
then David arose , and all the people who were with him , and they passed over the Jordan . by the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan .
Ab@@ sal@@ om set A@@ mas@@ a over the army instead of Jo@@ ab . now A@@ mas@@ a was the son of a man , whose name was I@@ thr@@ a the Israel@@ ite , who went in to Ab@@ ig@@ ail the daughter of N@@ ah@@ ash , sister to Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , Jo@@ ab 's mother .
it happened , when David had come to Ma@@ han@@ aim , that Sho@@ bi the son of N@@ ah@@ ash of Rab@@ ba@@ h of the children of Am@@ mon , and Mach@@ ir the son of Am@@ mi@@ el of Lo@@ deb@@ ar , and Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i the Gil@@ e@@ ad@@ ite of Rog@@ eli@@ m ,
honey , butter , sheep , and cheese of the herd , for David , and for the people who were with him , to eat : for they said , " The people are hungry , and weary , and thir@@ sty , in the wilderness . "
the king commanded Jo@@ ab and Ab@@ is@@ hai and It@@ tai , saying , " Deal gently for my sake with the young man , even with Ab@@ sal@@ om . " all the people heard when the king commanded all the cap@@ tains concerning Ab@@ sal@@ om .
a certain man saw it , and told Jo@@ ab , and said , " Be@@ hold , I saw Ab@@ sal@@ om hanging in an oak . "
Jo@@ ab said to the man who told him , " Be@@ hold , you saw it , and why did@@ n '@@ t you strike him there to the ground ? I would have given you ten pieces of silver , and a s@@ ash . "
otherwise if I had dealt fal@@ sely against his life ( and there is no matter hidden from the king ) , then you yourself would have set yourself against me . "
then Jo@@ ab said to the C@@ ush@@ ite , " Go , tell the king what you have seen ! " the C@@ ush@@ ite bowed himself to Jo@@ ab , and ran .
" but come what may , " he said , " I will run . " he said to him , " Run ! " then A@@ him@@ a@@ az ran by the way of the Pl@@ ain , and outr@@ an the C@@ ush@@ ite .
now David was sitting between the two gates : and the watch@@ man went up to the roof of the gate to the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , a man running alone .
the watch@@ man saw another man running ; and the watch@@ man called to the porter , and said , " Be@@ hold , a man running alone ! " the king said , " He also brings news . "
the watch@@ man said , " I think the running of the first one is like the running of A@@ him@@ a@@ az the son of Z@@ ad@@ ok . " the king said , " He is a good man , and comes with good news . "
the king said , " Is it well with the young man Ab@@ sal@@ om ? " A@@ him@@ a@@ az answered , " When Jo@@ ab sent the king 's servant , even me your servant , I saw a great tum@@ ult , but I don '@@ t know what it was . "
the king said , " Turn aside , and stand here . " he turned aside , and stood still .
the king covered his face , and the king cried with a loud voice , " My son Ab@@ sal@@ om , Ab@@ sal@@ om , my son , my son ! "
then the king arose , and sat in the gate . they told to all the people , saying , " Be@@ hold , the king is sitting in the gate . " all the people came before the king . now Israel had fled every man to his tent .
Ab@@ sal@@ om , whom we ano@@ inted over us , is dead in battle . now therefore why don '@@ t you speak a word of bringing the king back ? "
he bowed the heart of all the men of Jud@@ ah , even as one man ; so that they sent to the king , saying , " Return , you and all your servants . "
so the king returned , and came to the Jordan . Jud@@ ah came to Gil@@ gal , to go to meet the king , to bring the king over the Jordan .
Shim@@ ei the son of Ger@@ a , the Ben@@ jam@@ ite , who was of Bah@@ ur@@ im , hur@@ ried and came down with the men of Jud@@ ah to meet king David .
there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Zi@@ ba the servant of the house of Saul , and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king .
a ferry boat went to bring over the king 's household , and to do what he thought good . Shim@@ ei the son of Ger@@ a fell down before the king , when he had come over the Jordan .
for your servant knows that I have sin@@ ned . therefore behold , I have come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king . "
it happened , when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king , that the king said to him , " Why did@@ n '@@ t you go with me , M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth ? "
he answered , " My lord , O king , my servant deceived me . for your servant said , I will sadd@@ le me a don@@ key , that I may ride there@@ on , and go with the king ; because your servant is lame .
he has slan@@ dered your servant to my lord the king ; but my lord the king is as an angel of God . do therefore what is good in your eyes .
Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i the Gil@@ e@@ ad@@ ite came down from Rog@@ eli@@ m ; and he went over the Jordan with the king , to conduct him over the Jordan .
now Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i was a very aged man , even eighty years old : and he had provided the king with sust@@ en@@ ance while he lay at Ma@@ han@@ aim ; for he was a very great man .
the king said to Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i , " Come over with me , and I will sustain you with me in Jerusalem . "
all the people went over the Jordan , and the king went over . then the king kis@@ sed Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i , and blessed him ; and he returned to his own place .
so the king went over to Gil@@ gal , and Ch@@ im@@ ham went over with him . all the people of Jud@@ ah brought the king over , and also half the people of Israel .
behold , all the men of Israel came to the king , and said to the king , " Why have our brothers the men of Jud@@ ah stolen you away , and brought the king , and his household , over the Jordan , and all David 's men with him ? "
so all the men of Israel went up from following David , and followed She@@ ba the son of B@@ ich@@ ri ; but the men of Jud@@ ah joined with their king , from the Jordan even to Jerusalem .
then the king said to A@@ mas@@ a , " Call me the men of Jud@@ ah together within three days , and be here present . "
David said to Ab@@ is@@ hai , " Now She@@ ba the son of B@@ ich@@ ri will do us more harm than Ab@@ sal@@ om did . take your lord 's servants , and pursue after him , lest he get himself fortified cities , and escape out of our sight . "
there stood by him one of Jo@@ ab 's young men , and said , " He who favors Jo@@ ab , and he who is for David , let him follow Jo@@ ab ! "
he went through all the tribes of Israel to A@@ bel , and to B@@ eth Ma@@ ac@@ ah , and all the Ber@@ ites : and they were gathered together , and went also after him .
they came and be@@ sieg@@ ed him in A@@ bel of B@@ eth Ma@@ ac@@ ah , and they cast up a m@@ ound against the city , and it stood against the ram@@ part ; and all the people who were with Jo@@ ab batter@@ ed the wall , to throw it down .
then a wise woman cried out of the city , " He@@ ar , hear ! please say to Jo@@ ab , ' Come near here , that I may speak with you . ' "
I am among those who are peace@@ able and faithful in Israel . you seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel . why will you swallow up the inheritance of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ? "
and David said to the Gi@@ be@@ on@@ ites , " What shall I do for you ? and with what shall I make at@@ onement , that you may bless the inheritance of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ? "
they said to the king , " The man who consumed us , and who devised against us , that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel ,
let seven men of his sons be delivered to us , and we will hang them up to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in Gi@@ be@@ ah of Saul , the chosen of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . " the king said , " I will give them . "
but the king spared M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth , the son of Jonathan the son of Saul , because of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's oath that was between them , between David and Jonathan the son of Saul .
but the king took the two sons of R@@ iz@@ pa@@ h the daughter of Ai@@ ah , whom she bore to Saul , Ar@@ mon@@ i and M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth ; and the five sons of Mic@@ h@@ al the daughter of Saul , whom she bore to Adri@@ el the son of Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i the Me@@ hol@@ ath@@ ite .
he delivered them into the hands of the Gi@@ be@@ on@@ ites , and they han@@ ged them in the mountain before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and all seven of them fell together . they were put to death in the days of harvest , in the first days , at the beginning of barley harvest .
David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jab@@ esh Gil@@ e@@ ad , who had stolen them from the street of B@@ eth Sh@@ an , where the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had han@@ ged them , in the day that the Phil@@ ist@@ ines killed Saul in Gil@@ bo@@ a ;
and I@@ sh@@ bi@@ ben@@ ob , who was of the sons of the giant , the weight of whose spe@@ ar was three hundred she@@ k@@ els of brass in weight , he being armed with a new sword , thought to have sl@@ ain David .
but Ab@@ is@@ hai the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah helped him , and struck the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and killed him . then the men of David s@@ wore to him , saying , " You shall go no more out with us to battle , that you don '@@ t qu@@ en@@ ch the lamp of Israel . "
there was again war with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines at GO@@ B ; and El@@ han@@ an the son of Ja@@ are@@ ore@@ gi@@ m the Beth@@ le@@ hem@@ ite killed G@@ oli@@ ath the G@@ it@@ tite 's brother , the staff of whose spe@@ ar was like a we@@ aver 's beam .
there was again war at G@@ ath , where there was a man of great stature , who had on every hand six fingers , and on every foot six toes , four and twenty in number ; and he also was born to the giant .
these four were born to the giant in G@@ ath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
David spoke to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h the words of this song in the day that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of Saul :
God , my rock , in him I will take refuge ; my shield , and the horn of my salvation , my high tower , and my refuge . my s@@ avi@@ or , you save me from violence .
he rode on a cher@@ u@@ b , and flew . yes , he was seen on the wings of the wind .
he delivered me from my strong enemy , from those who hated me , for they were too mighty for me .
as for God , his way is perfect . the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is tested . he is a shield to all those who take refuge in him .
you also have delivered me from the stri@@ vings of my people . you have kept me to be the head of the nations . a people whom I have not known will serve me .
who brings me away from my enemies . yes , you lift me up above those who rise up against me . you deliver me from the violent man .
the God of Israel said , the Rock of Israel spoke to me , ' One who rules over men righte@@ ously , who rules in the fear of God ,
these are the names of the mighty men whom David had : Jos@@ he@@ b Bas@@ she@@ bet@@ h a Tah@@ chem@@ on@@ ite , chief of the cap@@ tains ; the same was Ad@@ ino the E@@ z@@ n@@ ite , against eight hundred sl@@ ain at one time .
after him was Sham@@ ma@@ h the son of A@@ ge@@ e a Har@@ ar@@ ite . the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were gathered together into a troop , where there was a plot of ground full of l@@ enti@@ ls ; and the people fled from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
but he stood in the midst of the plot , and defended it , and killed the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h worked a great victory .
three of the thirty chief men went down , and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Ad@@ ul@@ lam ; and the troop of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines was enc@@ amped in the valley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
David long@@ ed , and said , " Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem , which is by the gate ! "
the three mighty men broke through the army of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but he would not drink of it , but poured it out to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
he said , " Be it far from me , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that I should do this ! is@@ n '@@ t it the blood of the men who went in jeopar@@ dy of their lives ? " therefore he would not drink it . the three mighty men did these things .
Ab@@ is@@ hai , the brother of Jo@@ ab , the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , was chief of the three . he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , the son of a val@@ i@@ ant man of Kab@@ ze@@ el , who had done mighty deeds , he killed the two sons of Ari@@ el of Mo@@ ab : he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow .
he killed an Egyptian , a goo@@ dly man : and the Egyptian had a spe@@ ar in his hand ; but he went down to him with a staff , and pl@@ ucked the spe@@ ar out of the Egyptian 's hand , and killed him with his own spe@@ ar .
again the anger of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was kind@@ led against Israel , and he moved David against them , saying , " Go , number Israel and Jud@@ ah . "
they passed over the Jordan , and enc@@ amped in A@@ ro@@ er , on the right side of the city that is in the middle of the valley of G@@ ad , and to J@@ az@@ er :
Jo@@ ab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to the king : and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand val@@ i@@ ant men who drew the sword ; and the men of Jud@@ ah were five hundred thousand men .
" go and speak to David , ' Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " I offer you three things . choose one of them , that I may do it to you . " ' "
David said to G@@ ad , " I am in distress . let us fall now into the hand of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; for his mer@@ cies are great . let me not fall into the hand of man . "
G@@ ad came that day to David , and said to him , " Go up , build an altar to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h on the thresh@@ ing floor of Ara@@ un@@ ah the Je@@ bus@@ ite . "
Ara@@ un@@ ah looked out , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him . then Ara@@ un@@ ah went out , and bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground .
Ara@@ un@@ ah said , " Why has my lord the king come to his servant ? " David said , " To buy your thresh@@ ing floor , to build an altar to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that the plague may be stopped from afflic@@ ting the people . "
Ara@@ un@@ ah said to David , " Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him . behold , the cattle for the burnt offering , and the thresh@@ ing instruments and the y@@ okes of the ox@@ en for the wood :
David built an altar to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h there , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings . so Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was entre@@ ated for the land , and the plague was stayed from Israel .
so they sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all the borders of Israel , and found Ab@@ is@@ ha@@ g the S@@ hun@@ amm@@ ite , and brought her to the king .
the young lady was very beautiful ; and she cherished the king , and minist@@ ered to him ; but the king did@@ n '@@ t know her intim@@ ately .
then Ad@@ oni@@ jah the son of H@@ agg@@ ith exalted himself , saying , " I will be king . " then he prepared him ch@@ ari@@ ots and hor@@ sem@@ en , and fifty men to run before him .
his father had not dis@@ pleased him at any time in saying , " Why have you done so ? " and he was also a very handsome man ; and he was born after Ab@@ sal@@ om .
but Z@@ ad@@ ok the priest , and Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and Na@@ than the prophet , and Shim@@ ei , and Re@@ i , and the mighty men who belonged to David , were not with Ad@@ oni@@ jah .
Ad@@ oni@@ jah killed sheep and cattle and fat@@ lings by the stone of Zo@@ hel@@ eth , which is beside E@@ n Rog@@ el ; and he called all his brothers , the king 's sons , and all the men of Jud@@ ah , the king 's servants :
Bath@@ she@@ ba went in to the king into the room . the king was very old ; and Ab@@ is@@ ha@@ g the S@@ hun@@ amm@@ ite was minist@@ ering to the king .
Bath@@ she@@ ba bowed , and showed respect to the king . the king said , " What would you like ? "
she said to him , " My lord , you s@@ wore by Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God to your hand@@ maid , ' As@@ su@@ re@@ dly Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne . '
he has sl@@ ain cattle and fat@@ lings and sheep in abundance , and has called all the sons of the king , and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the priest , and Jo@@ ab the captain of the army ; but he h@@ as@@ n '@@ t called Solomon your servant .
otherwise it will happen , when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers , that I and my son Solomon shall be counted off@@ enders . "
for he is gone down this day , and has sl@@ ain cattle and fat@@ lings and sheep in abundance , and has called all the king 's sons , and the cap@@ tains of the army , and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the priest . behold , they are eating and drinking before him , and say , ' Long live king Ad@@ oni@@ jah ! '
the king s@@ wore , and said , " As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , who has re@@ deemed my soul out of all ad@@ versity ,
most certainly as I s@@ wore to you by Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , saying , ' As@@ su@@ re@@ dly Solomon your son shall reign after me , and he shall sit on my throne in my place ; ' most certainly so will I do this day . "
then Bath@@ she@@ ba bowed with her face to the earth , and showed respect to the king , and said , " Let my lord king David live forever ! "
the king said to them , " Take with you the servants of your lord , and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mu@@ le , and bring him down to Gi@@ hon .
then you shall come up after him , and he shall come and sit on my throne ; for he shall be king in my place . I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Jud@@ ah . "
Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada answered the king , and said , " A@@ men . may Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of my lord the king , say so .
as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has been with my lord the king , even so may he be with Solomon , and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David . "
so Z@@ ad@@ ok the priest , and Na@@ than the prophet , and Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites and the Pel@@ eth@@ ites , went down , and caused Solomon to ride on king David 's mu@@ le , and brought him to Gi@@ hon .
Z@@ ad@@ ok the priest took the horn of oil out of the T@@ ent , and ano@@ inted Solomon . they blew the trum@@ pet ; and all the people said , " Long live king Solomon ! "
all the people came up after him , and the people pi@@ ped with pipes , and rejo@@ iced with great joy , so that the earth shook with their sound .
while he yet spoke , behold , Jonathan the son of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the priest came : and Ad@@ oni@@ jah said , " Come in ; for you are a worthy man , and bring good news . "
the king has sent with him Z@@ ad@@ ok the priest , Na@@ than the prophet , Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites and the Pel@@ eth@@ ites ; and they have caused him to ride on the king 's mu@@ le .
Z@@ ad@@ ok the priest and Na@@ than the prophet have ano@@ inted him king in Gi@@ hon . they have come up from there rejo@@ icing , so that the city rang again . this is the noise that you have heard .
moreover the king 's servants came to bless our lord king David , saying , ' May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name , and make his throne greater than your throne ; ' and the king bowed himself on the bed .
also thus said the king , ' Bless@@ ed be Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , who has given one to sit on my throne this day , my eyes even seeing it . ' "
it was told Solomon , saying , " Be@@ hold , Ad@@ oni@@ jah fears king Solomon ; for , behold , he has laid hold on the horns of the altar , saying , ' Let king Solomon swear to me first that he will not kill his servant with the sword . ' "
Solomon said , " If he shows himself a worthy man , not a hair of him shall fall to the earth ; but if w@@ ick@@ edness be found in him , he shall die . "
so king Solomon sent , and they brought him down from the altar . he came and bowed down to king Solomon ; and Solomon said to him , " Go to your house . "
now the days of David drew near that he should die ; and he commanded Solomon his son , saying ,
do therefore according to your wisdom , and don '@@ t let his gray head go down to She@@ ol in peace .
but show kindness to the sons of Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i the Gil@@ e@@ ad@@ ite , and let them be of those who eat at your table ; for so they came to me when I fled from Ab@@ sal@@ om your brother .
now therefore don '@@ t hold him guil@@ tless , for you are a wise man ; and you will know what you ought to do to him , and you shall bring his gray head down to She@@ ol with blood . "
now I ask one petition of you . Don '@@ t deny me . " she said to him , " S@@ ay on . "
he said , " Please speak to Solomon the king ( for he will not tell you ' no ' ) , that he give me Ab@@ is@@ ha@@ g the S@@ hun@@ amm@@ ite as wife . "
Bath@@ she@@ ba therefore went to king Solomon , to speak to him for Ad@@ oni@@ jah . the king rose up to meet her , and bowed himself to her , and sat down on his throne , and caused a throne to be set for the king 's mother ; and she sat on his right hand .
then she said , " I ask one small petition of you ; don '@@ t deny me . " the king said to her , " As@@ k on , my mother ; for I will not deny you . "
now therefore as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , who has established me , and set me on the throne of David my father , and who has made me a house , as he promised , surely Ad@@ oni@@ jah shall be put to death this day . "
so Solomon thrust out A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar from being priest to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that he might fulfill the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke concerning the house of El@@ i in Sh@@ il@@ oh .
it was told king Solomon , " Jo@@ ab has fled to the T@@ ent of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and behold , he is by the altar . " then Solomon sent Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , saying , " Go , fall on him . "
Ben@@ aiah came to the T@@ ent of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and said to him , " Th@@ us says the king , ' Come forth ! ' " he said , " No ; but I will die here . " Ben@@ aiah brought the king word again , saying , " Th@@ us said Jo@@ ab , and thus he answered me . "
the king said to him , " Do as he has said , and fall on him , and bury him ; that you may take away the blood , which Jo@@ ab shed without cause , from me and from my father 's house .
so shall their blood return on the head of Jo@@ ab , and on the head of his seed forever . but to David , and to his seed , and to his house , and to his throne , there shall be peace forever from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
the king put Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada in his place over the army ; and the king put Z@@ ad@@ ok the priest in the place of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar .
the king sent and called for Shim@@ ei , and said to him , " Build yourself a house in Jerusalem , and dwell there , and don '@@ t go out from there anywhere .
for on the day you go out , and pass over the bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , know for certain that you shall surely die : your blood shall be on your own head . "
Shim@@ ei said to the king , " The saying is good . as my lord the king has said , so will your servant do . " Shim@@ ei lived in Jerusalem many days .
it happened at the end of three years , that two of the servants of Shim@@ ei ran away to Ach@@ ish , son of Ma@@ ac@@ ah , king of G@@ ath . they told Shim@@ ei , saying , " Be@@ hold , your servants are in G@@ ath . "
why then have you not kept the oath of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the commandment that I have instructed you with ? "
the king said moreover to Shim@@ ei , " You know all the w@@ ick@@ edness which your heart is priv@@ y to , that you did to David my father . therefore Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall return your w@@ ick@@ edness on your own head .
only the people sacrificed in the high places , because there was no house built for the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h until those days .
in Gi@@ be@@ on Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h appeared to Solomon in a dream by night ; and God said , " As@@ k what I shall give you . "
God said to him , " Because you have asked this thing , and have not asked for yourself long life , neither have asked riches for yourself , nor have asked the life of your enemies , but have asked for yourself understanding to discern justice ;
behold , I have done according to your word . behold , I have given you a wise and an understanding heart ; so that there has been none like you before you , neither after you shall any arise like you .
when I rose in the morning to nurse my child , behold , it was dead ; but when I had looked at it in the morning , behold , it was not my son , whom I bore . "
the other woman said , " No ; but the living is my son , and the dead is your son . " this said , " No ; but the dead is your son , and the living is my son . " thus they spoke before the king .
all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged ; and they feared the king : for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him , to do justice .
and Az@@ ari@@ ah the son of Na@@ than was over the officers ; and Zab@@ ud the son of Na@@ than was chief minister , the king 's friend ;
Ben Ge@@ ber , in Ram@@ o@@ th Gil@@ e@@ ad ( to him belonged the towns of J@@ air the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , which are in Gil@@ e@@ ad ; to him belonged the region of Ar@@ go@@ b , which is in Bash@@ an , sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars ) ;
Ge@@ ber the son of U@@ ri , in the land of Gil@@ e@@ ad , the country of Si@@ hon king of the A@@ mor@@ ites and of O@@ g king of Bash@@ an ; and he was the only officer who was in the land .
Jud@@ ah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude , eating and drinking and making mer@@ ry .
ten head of fat cattle , and twenty head of cattle out of the past@@ ures , and one hundred sheep , besides har@@ ts , and gaz@@ elles , and ro@@ e@@ bucks , and f@@ atten@@ ed f@@ owl .
those officers provided food for king Solomon , and for all who came to king Solomon 's table , every man in his month ; they let nothing be lacking .
barley also and straw for the horses and swift ste@@ eds brought they to the place where the officers were , every man according to his duty .
there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon , from all kings of the earth , who had heard of his wisdom .
" you know how that David my father could not build a house for the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God for the wars which were about him on every side , until Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h put them under the sol@@ es of his feet .
behold , I purpose to build a house for the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h my God , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke to David my father , saying , ' Your son , whom I will set on your throne in your place , he shall build the house for my name . '
Hir@@ am sent to Solomon , saying , " I have heard the message which you have sent to me . I will do all your desire concerning timber of c@@ edar , and concerning timber of f@@ ir .
the king commanded , and they cut out great stones , costly stones , to lay the foundation of the house with worked stone .
Solomon 's builders and Hir@@ am 's builders and the Ge@@ bal@@ ites cut them , and prepared the timber and the stones to build the house .
the house , when it was in building , was built of stone prepared at the quar@@ ry ; and there was neither hammer nor ax@@ e nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
so he built the house , and finished it ; and he covered the house with beams and plan@@ ks of c@@ edar .
he built twenty cub@@ its on the hinder part of the house with boards of c@@ edar from the floor to the ceiling : he built them for it within , for an or@@ acle , even for the most holy place .
he prepared an or@@ acle in the midst of the house within , to set there the ark of the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
within the or@@ acle was twenty cub@@ its in length , and twenty cub@@ its in breadth , and twenty cub@@ its in its height ; and he over@@ laid it with pure gold : and he covered the altar with c@@ edar .
so Solomon over@@ laid the house within with pure gold : and he drew chains of gold across before the or@@ acle ; and he over@@ laid it with gold .
the whole house he over@@ laid with gold , until all the house was finished : also the whole altar that belonged to the or@@ acle he over@@ laid with gold .
five cub@@ its was the one wing of the cher@@ u@@ b , and five cub@@ its the other wing of the cher@@ u@@ b : from the utter@@ most part of the one wing to the utter@@ most part of the other were ten cub@@ its .
and two doors of f@@ ir wood : the two leaves of the one door were folding , and the two leaves of the other door were folding .
he carved cher@@ ub@@ im and palm trees and open flowers ; and he over@@ laid them with gold fitted on the engra@@ ved work .
in the eleventh year , in the month Bu@@ l , which is the eighth month , was the house finished throughout all its parts , and according to all its fashion . so was he seven years in building it .
for he built the house of the forest of Lebanon ; its length was one hundred cub@@ its , and its breadth fifty cub@@ its , and its height thirty cub@@ its , on four rows of c@@ edar pillars , with c@@ edar beams on the pillars .
he made the por@@ ch of the throne where he was to judge , even the por@@ ch of judgment : and it was covered with c@@ edar from floor to floor .
his house where he was to dwell , the other court within the por@@ ch , was of the like work . he made also a house for Phar@@ aoh 's daughter ( whom Solomon had taken as wife ) , like this por@@ ch .
all these were of costly stones , even of cut stone , according to measure , saw@@ ed with s@@ aws , inside and outside , even from the foundation to the coping , and so on the outside to the great court .
the great court around had three courses of cut stone , and a course of c@@ edar beams ; like as the inner court of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the por@@ ch of the house .
he made two capitals of mol@@ ten brass , to set on the tops of the pillars : the height of the one capital was five cub@@ its , and the height of the other capital was five cub@@ its .
there were nets of chec@@ ker work , and wre@@ aths of chain work , for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars ; seven for the one capital , and seven for the other capital .
so he made the pillars ; and there were two rows around on the one network , to cover the capitals that were on the top of the pillars : and he did so for the other capital .
there were capitals above also on the two pillars , close by the belly which was beside the network : and the p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates were two hundred , in rows around on the other capital .
he set up the pillars at the por@@ ch of the temple : and he set up the right pillar , and called its name J@@ ach@@ in ; and he set up the left pillar , and called its name Bo@@ az .
it stood on twelve ox@@ en , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east ; and the sea was set on them above , and all their hinder parts were inward .
the work of the bases was like this : they had panels ; and there were panels between the le@@ dges ;
and on the panels that were between the le@@ dges were lions , ox@@ en , and cher@@ ub@@ im ; and on the le@@ dges there was a pe@@ dest@@ al above ; and beneath the lions and ox@@ en were wre@@ aths of hanging work .
every base had four bronze wheels , and ax@@ les of brass ; and the four feet of it had supports : beneath the basin were the supports mol@@ ten , with wre@@ aths at the side of each .
there were four supports at the four corners of each base : its supports were of the base itself .
in the top of the base was there a round compass half a cub@@ it high ; and on the top of the base its stays and its panels were of the same .
on the plates of its stays , and on its panels , he engra@@ ved cher@@ ub@@ im , lions , and palm trees , according to the space of each , with wre@@ aths all around .
in this way , he made the ten bases : all of them had one casting , one measure , and one form .
he set the bases , five on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward , toward the south .
Hir@@ am made the basins , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the basins . so Hir@@ am made an end of doing all the work that he worked for king Solomon in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h :
and the four hundred p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates for the two networks ; two rows of p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates for each network , to cover the two bow@@ ls of the capitals that were on the pillars ;
and the pots , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the basins : even all these vessels , which Hir@@ am made for king Solomon , in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , were of bur@@ nished brass .
Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : the golden altar , and the table where@@ upon the show bread was , of gold ;
and the lam@@ p@@ stands , five on the right side , and five on the left , before the or@@ acle , of pure gold ; and the flowers , and the lamps , and the t@@ ongs , of gold ;
all the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast , in the month E@@ than@@ im , which is the seventh month .
they brought up the ark of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the T@@ ent of Meeting , and all the holy vessels that were in the T@@ ent ; even these the priests and the Lev@@ ites brought up .
the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place before the or@@ acle ; but they were not seen outside : and there they are to this day .
there was nothing in the ark except the two tables of stone which Moses put there at H@@ ore@@ b , when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h made a covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of the land of Egypt .
so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud ; for the glory of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h filled the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
he said , " Bless@@ ed is Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , who spoke with his mouth to David your father , and has with his hand fulfilled it , saying ,
nevertheless , you shall not build the house ; but your son who shall come forth out of your body , he shall build the house for my name . '
there I have set a place for the ark , in which is the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he made with our fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt . "
Solomon stood before the altar of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in the presence of all the assembly of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heaven ;
and he said , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , there is no God like you , in heaven above , or on earth beneath ; who keep covenant and loving kindness with your servants , who walk before you with all their heart ;
who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him . yes , you spoke with your mouth , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
but will God in very deed dwell on the earth ? behold , heaven and the heaven of heavens can '@@ t contain you ; how much less this house that I have built !
yet have respect for the prayer of your servant , and for his suppl@@ ication , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h my God , to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant pra@@ ys before you this day ;
listen to the suppl@@ ication of your servant , and of your people Israel , when they shall pray toward this place . yes , hear in heaven , your dwelling place ; and when you hear , forgive .
" if a man sins against his neighbor , and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear , and he comes and swear before your altar in this house ;
then hear in heaven , and do , and judge your servants , condemning the wicked , to bring his way on his own head , and justi@@ fying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
" when the sky is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sin@@ ned against you ; if they pray toward this place , and confess your name , and turn from their sin , when you aff@@ l@@ ict them :
then hear in heaven , and forgive the sin of your servants , and of your people Israel , when you teach them the good way in which they should walk ; and send rain on your land , which you have given to your people for an inheritance .
then hear in heaven , your dwelling place , and forgive , and do , and render to every man according to all his ways , whose heart you know ; ( for you , even you only , know the hearts of all the children of men ; )
" moreover concerning the foreigner , who is not of your people Israel , when he shall come out of a far country for your name 's sake
" if your people go out to battle against their enemy , by whatever way you shall send them , and they pray to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h toward the city which you have chosen , and toward the house which I have built for your name ;
yet if they shall repent in the land where they are carried captive , and turn again , and make suppl@@ ication to you in the land of those who carried them captive , saying , ' We have sin@@ ned , and have done per@@ vers@@ ely ; we have dealt w@@ ick@@ edly ; '
that your eyes may be open to the suppl@@ ication of your servant , and to the suppl@@ ication of your people Israel , to listen to them whenever they cry to you .
for you separated them from among all the peoples of the earth , to be your inheritance , as you spoke by Moses your servant , when you brought our fathers out of Egypt , Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
" blessed be Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , who has given rest to his people Israel , according to all that he promised . there has not failed one word of all his good promise , which he promised by Moses his servant .
that he may incl@@ ine our hearts to him , to walk in all his ways , and to keep his commandments , and his statutes , and his ordin@@ ances , which he commanded our fathers .
that all the peoples of the earth may know that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , he is God . there is none else .
" let your heart therefore be perfect with Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God , to walk in his statutes , and to keep his commandments , as at this day . "
Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings , which he offered to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , two and twenty thousand head of cattle , and one hundred twenty thousand sheep . so the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
as for you , if you will walk before me , as David your father walked , in integrity of heart , and in upri@@ ghtness , to do according to all that I have commanded you , and will keep my statutes and my ordin@@ ances ;
then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever , according as I promised to David your father , saying , ' There shall not fail you a man on the throne of Israel . '
but if you turn away from following me , you or your children , and not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you , but shall go and serve other gods , and worship them ;
though this house is so high , yet shall everyone who passes by it be astonished , and shall h@@ iss ; and they shall say , ' Why has Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h done thus to this land , and to this house ? '
it happened at the end of twenty years , in which Solomon had built the two houses , the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h and the king 's house
( now Hir@@ am the king of Ty@@ re had furnished Solomon with c@@ edar trees and f@@ ir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire ) , that then king Solomon gave Hir@@ am twenty cities in the land of Gal@@ ilee .
this is the reason of the lev@@ y which king Solomon raised , to build the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and his own house , and Mill@@ o , and the wall of Jerusalem , and Haz@@ or , and Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do , and Ge@@ zer .
Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Ge@@ zer , and burnt it with fire , and sl@@ ain the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites who lived in the city , and given it for a portion to his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
and all the storage cities that Solomon had , and the cities for his ch@@ ari@@ ots , and the cities for his hor@@ sem@@ en , and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem , and in Lebanon , and in all the land of his dom@@ inion .
as for all the people who were left of the A@@ mor@@ ites , the Hit@@ ti@@ tes , the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ites , the Hi@@ v@@ ites , and the Je@@ bus@@ ites , who were not of the children of Israel ;
their children who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy , of them Solomon raised a lev@@ y of bond@@ servants to this day .
but of the children of Israel Solomon made no bond@@ servants ; but they were the men of war , and his servants , and his princes , and his cap@@ tains , and rulers of his ch@@ ari@@ ots and of his hor@@ sem@@ en .
but Phar@@ aoh 's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which Solomon had built for her : then he built Mill@@ o .
Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar which he built to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h three times a year , burning inc@@ ense with them , on the altar that was before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . so he finished the house .
King Solomon made a navy of ships in E@@ z@@ ion Ge@@ ber , which is beside E@@ lo@@ th , on the shore of the Red Sea , in the land of E@@ dom .
Hir@@ am sent in the navy his servants , sailors who had knowledge of the sea , with the servants of Solomon .
when the queen of She@@ ba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon , and the house that he had built ,
and the food of his table , and the sitting of his servants , and the attendance of his ministers , and their clothing , and his cup bearers , and his ascent by which he went up to the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; there was no more spirit in her .
she said to the king , " It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts , and of your wisdom .
blessed is Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , who delighted in you , to set you on the throne of Israel . because Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h loved Israel forever , therefore made he you king , to do justice and righteousness . "
she gave the king one hundred twenty talents of gold , and of spices very great store , and precious stones . there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of She@@ ba gave to king Solomon .
the king made of the al@@ mu@@ g trees pillars for the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and for the king 's house , har@@ ps also and str@@ ing@@ ed instruments for the singers : there came no such al@@ mu@@ g trees , nor were seen , to this day .
besides that which the traders brought , and the traffic of the merchants , and of all the kings of the mixed people , and of the governors of the country .
there were six steps to the throne , and the top of the throne was round behind ; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat , and two lions standing beside the stays .
Solomon gathered together ch@@ ari@@ ots and hor@@ sem@@ en : and he had a thousand and four hundred ch@@ ari@@ ots , and twelve thousand hor@@ sem@@ en , that he bestowed in the ch@@ ari@@ ot cities , and with the king at Jerusalem .
the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt ; and the king 's merchants received them in dro@@ ves , each drove at a price .
now king Solomon loved many foreign women , together with the daughter of Phar@@ aoh , women of the Mo@@ ab@@ ites , Am@@ mon@@ ites , E@@ dom@@ ites , Sid@@ onians , and Hit@@ ti@@ tes ;
for it happened , when Solomon was old , that his wives turned away his heart after other gods ; and his heart was not perfect with Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God , as was the heart of David his father .
then Solomon built a high place for Chem@@ osh the ab@@ om@@ ination of Mo@@ ab , on the mountain that is before Jerusalem , and for Mol@@ ech the ab@@ om@@ ination of the children of Am@@ mon .
and had commanded him concerning this thing , that he should not go after other gods : but he did@@ n '@@ t keep that which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h commanded .
therefore Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Solomon , " Because this is done by you , and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes , which I have commanded you , I will surely tear the kingdom from you , and will give it to your servant .
notwithstanding I will not do it in your days , for David your father 's sake ; but I will tear it out of the hand of your son .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h raised up an adversary to Solomon , had@@ ad the E@@ dom@@ ite : he was of the king 's seed in E@@ dom .
for it happened , when David was in E@@ dom , and Jo@@ ab the captain of the army was gone up to bury the sl@@ ain , and had struck every male in E@@ dom
had@@ ad found great favor in the sight of Phar@@ aoh , so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife , the sister of Tah@@ pen@@ es the queen .
when had@@ ad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers , and that Jo@@ ab the captain of the army was dead , had@@ ad said to Phar@@ aoh , " Let me depart , that I may go to my own country . "
then Phar@@ aoh said to him , " But what have you lacked with me , that behold , you seek to go to your own country ? " he answered , " No@@ thing , however only let me depart . "
J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , an E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im@@ ite of Zer@@ ed@@ ah , a servant of Solomon , whose mother 's name was Zer@@ u@@ ah , a widow , he also lifted up his hand against the king .
the man J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am was a mighty man of val@@ or ; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industri@@ ous , and he put him in charge of all the labor of the house of Joseph .
it happened at that time , when J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am went out of Jerusalem , that the prophet A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite found him in the way ; now A@@ hij@@ ah had cl@@ ad himself with a new garment ; and they two were alone in the field .
he said to J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am , " Take ten pieces ; for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , ' Be@@ hold , I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon , and will give ten tribes to you
" ' however I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand ; but I will make him prince all the days of his life , for David my servant 's sake whom I chose , who kept my commandments and my statutes ;
Solomon sought therefore to kill J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am ; but J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am arose , and fled into Egypt , to Sh@@ is@@ hak king of Egypt , and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon .
it happened , when J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat heard of it ( for he was yet in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon , and J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am lived in Egypt ,
King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am took counsel with the old men , who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , " What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people ? "
they spoke to him , saying , " If you will be a servant to this people this day , and will serve them , and answer them , and speak good words to them , then they will be your servants forever . "
but he for@@ s@@ ook the counsel of the old men which they had given him , and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him , who stood before him .
he said to them , " What counsel do you give , that we may return answer to this people , who have spoken to me , saying , ' Make the y@@ oke that your father put on us lighter ? ' "
now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy y@@ oke , I will add to your y@@ oke : my father ch@@ asti@@ sed you with whi@@ ps , but I will ch@@ as@@ tise you with scor@@ pi@@ ons . ' "
so J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am and all the people came to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am the third day , as the king asked , saying , " Come to me again the third day . "
the king answered the people roughly , and for@@ s@@ ook the counsel of the old men which they had given him ,
and spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men , saying , " My father made your y@@ oke heavy , but I will add to your y@@ oke . my father ch@@ asti@@ sed you with whi@@ ps , but I will ch@@ as@@ tise you with scor@@ pi@@ ons . "
so the king did@@ n '@@ t listen to the people ; for it was a thing brought about of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that he might establish his word , which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke by A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite to J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat .
then king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am sent Ad@@ or@@ am , who was over the men subject to forced labor ; and all Israel st@@ oned him to death with stones . King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made speed to get him up to his ch@@ ari@@ ot , to flee to Jerusalem .
it happened , when all Israel heard that J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am was returned , that they sent and called him to the congregation , and made him king over all Israel : there was none who followed the house of David , but the tribe of Jud@@ ah only .
when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am had come to Jerusalem , he assembled all the house of Jud@@ ah , and the tribe of Benjamin , a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men , who were warriors , to fight against the house of Israel , to bring the kingdom again to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am the son of Solomon .
then J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am built Sh@@ ec@@ hem in the hill country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and lived in it ; and he went out from there , and built Pen@@ u@@ el .
if this people goes up to offer sacrifices in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h at Jerusalem , then the heart of this people will turn again to their lord , even to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am king of Jud@@ ah ; and they will kill me , and return to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am king of Jud@@ ah . "
he made houses of high places , and made priests from among all the people , who were not of the sons of Lev@@ i .
he went up to the altar which he had made in Be@@ the@@ l on the fif@@ teenth day in the eighth month , even in the month which he had devised of his own heart : and he ordained a feast for the children of Israel , and went up to the altar , to burn inc@@ ense .
the king said to the man of God , " Come home with me , and refresh yourself , and I will give you a reward . "
the man of God said to the king , " Even if you gave me half of your house , I would not go in with you , neither would I eat bread nor drink water in this place ;
for so was it commanded me by the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , saying , ' You shall eat no bread , nor drink water , neither return by the way that you came . ' "
now there lived an old prophet in Be@@ the@@ l ; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Be@@ the@@ l . they also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king .
their father said to them , " Which way did he go ? " now his sons had seen which way the man of God went , who came from Jud@@ ah .
he said to his sons , " Sadd@@ le the don@@ key for me . " so they sadd@@ led the don@@ key for him ; and he rode on it .
he went after the man of God , and found him sitting under an oak . he said to him , " Are you the man of God who came from Jud@@ ah ? " he said , " I am . "
for it was said to me by the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' You shall eat no bread nor drink water there , nor turn again to go by the way that you came . ' "
it happened , as they sat at the table , that the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came to the prophet who brought him back ;
and he cried to the man of God who came from Jud@@ ah , saying , " Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' Because you have been dis@@ obedient to the mouth of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and have not kept the commandment which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God commanded you ,
but came back , and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you , " E@@ at no bread , and drink no water " ; your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers . ' "
it happened , after he had eaten bread , and after he had drunk , that he sadd@@ led the don@@ key for the prophet whom he had brought back .
when he had gone , a lion met him by the way , and killed him . his body was cast in the way , and the don@@ key stood by it . the lion also stood by the body .
the prophet took up the body of the man of God , and laid it on the don@@ key , and brought it back . he came to the city of the old prophet to mour@@ n , and to bury him .
he laid his body in his own grave ; and they mour@@ ned over him , saying , " Al@@ as , my brother ! "
J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am said to his wife , " Please get up and disguise yourself , that you won '@@ t be recognized as the wife of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am . go to Sh@@ il@@ oh . behold , there is A@@ hij@@ ah the prophet , who spoke concerning me that I should be king over this people .
J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am 's wife did so , and arose , and went to Sh@@ il@@ oh , and came to the house of A@@ hij@@ ah . now A@@ hij@@ ah could not see ; for his eyes were set by reason of his age .
go , tell J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am , ' Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel : " because I exalted you from among the people , and made you prince over my people Israel ,
but have done evil above all who were before you , and have gone and made you other gods , and mol@@ ten images , to provoke me to anger , and have cast me behind your back :
he who dies of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am in the city shall the dogs eat ; and he who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat : for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken it . " '
all Israel shall mour@@ n for him , and bury him ; for he only of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am shall come to the grave , because in him there is found some good thing toward Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , in the house of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am .
moreover Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will raise him up a king over Israel , who shall cut off the house of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am . this is day ! what ? even now .
for they also built them high places , and pillars , and Ash@@ eri@@ m , on every high hill , and under every green tree ;
and there were also so@@ dom@@ ites in the land : they did according to all the ab@@ om@@ inations of the nations which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h drove out before the children of Israel .
it happened in the fifth year of king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , that Sh@@ is@@ hak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem ;
King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made in their place shi@@ elds of brass , and committed them to the hands of the cap@@ tains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David : and his mother 's name was Na@@ am@@ ah the Am@@ monit@@ ess . A@@ bi@@ jam his son re@@ igned in his place .
now in the eighteenth year of king J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat began A@@ bi@@ jam to reign over Jud@@ ah .
nevertheless for David 's sake , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem , to set up his son after him , and to establish Jerusalem ;
because David did that which was right in the eyes of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and did@@ n '@@ t turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life , except only in the matter of Uri@@ ah the Hit@@ tite .
he put away the so@@ dom@@ ites out of the land , and removed all the idols that his fathers had made .
also Ma@@ ac@@ ah his mother he removed from being queen , because she had made an ab@@ om@@ in@@ able image for an Ash@@ er@@ ah ; and As@@ a cut down her image , and burnt it at the bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
he brought into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h the things that his father had dedicated , and the things that himself had dedicated , silver , and gold , and vessels .
Ben had@@ ad listened to king As@@ a , and sent the cap@@ tains of his armies against the cities of Israel , and struck I@@ j@@ on , and Dan , and A@@ bel B@@ eth Ma@@ ac@@ ah , and all Chin@@ ner@@ o@@ th , with all the land of N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i .
then king As@@ a made a pro@@ clamation to all Jud@@ ah ; none was exemp@@ ted : and they carried away the stones of Ram@@ ah , and its timber , with which Ba@@ asha had built ; and king As@@ a built there@@ with Ge@@ ba of Benjamin , and M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin .
Ba@@ asha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah , of the house of Is@@ sac@@ har , con@@ spi@@ red against him ; and Ba@@ asha struck him at Gi@@ b@@ be@@ thon , which belonged to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; for Nad@@ ab and all Israel were laying siege to Gi@@ b@@ be@@ thon .
for the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am which he sin@@ ned , and with which he made Israel to sin , because of his provocation with which he provoked Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to anger .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and walked in the way of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am , and in his sin with which he made Israel to sin .
" because I exalted you out of the dust , and made you prince over my people Israel , and you have walked in the way of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am , and have made my people Israel to sin , to provoke me to anger with their sins ;
the dogs will eat Ba@@ asha 's descendants who die in the city ; and he who dies of his in the field the birds of the sky will eat . "
his servant Zim@@ ri , captain of half his ch@@ ari@@ ots , con@@ spi@@ red against him . now he was in Tir@@ z@@ ah , drinking himself drunk in the house of Ar@@ za , who was over the household in Tir@@ z@@ ah :
and Zim@@ ri went in and struck him , and killed him , in the twenty @@@ -@@ @ seventh year of As@@ a king of Jud@@ ah , and re@@ igned in his place .
thus Zim@@ ri destroyed all the house of Ba@@ asha , according to the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke against Ba@@ asha by Je@@ hu the prophet ,
for all the sins of Ba@@ asha , and the sins of E@@ lah his son , which they sin@@ ned , and with which they made Israel to sin , to provoke Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to anger with their van@@ ities .
in the twenty @@@ -@@ @ seventh year of As@@ a king of Jud@@ ah , Zim@@ ri re@@ igned seven days in Tir@@ z@@ ah . now the people were enc@@ amped against Gi@@ b@@ be@@ thon , which belonged to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
the people who were enc@@ amped heard say , Zim@@ ri has con@@ spi@@ red , and has also struck the king : therefore all Israel made Om@@ ri , the captain of the army , king over Israel that day in the camp .
for his sins which he sin@@ ned in doing that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , in walking in the way of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am , and in his sin which he did , to make Israel to sin .
then were the people of Israel divided into two parts : half of the people followed Ti@@ b@@ ni the son of G@@ in@@ ath , to make him king ; and half followed Om@@ ri .
he bought the hill Sam@@ aria of Sh@@ em@@ er for two talents of silver ; and he built on the hill , and called the name of the city which he built , after the name of Sh@@ em@@ er , the owner of the hill , Sam@@ aria .
Om@@ ri did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and dealt w@@ ick@@ edly above all who were before him .
for he walked in all the way of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , and in his sins with which he made Israel to sin , to provoke Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to anger with their van@@ ities .
in the thirty @@@ -@@ @ eighth year of As@@ a king of Jud@@ ah began A@@ hab the son of Om@@ ri to reign over Israel : and A@@ hab the son of Om@@ ri re@@ igned over Israel in Sam@@ aria twenty @@@ -@@ @ two years .
A@@ hab made the Ash@@ er@@ ah ; and A@@ hab did yet more to provoke Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him .
in his days Hi@@ el the Beth@@ elite built Jer@@ ich@@ o : he laid its foundation with the loss of A@@ bir@@ am his fir@@ st@@ born , and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son Se@@ gu@@ b , according to the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke by Joshua the son of N@@ un .
Elijah the T@@ ish@@ bite , who was of the foreigners of Gil@@ e@@ ad , said to A@@ hab , " As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , lives , before whom I stand , there shall not be de@@ w nor rain these years , but according to my word . "
" go away from here , turn eastward , and hide yourself by the bro@@ ok Cher@@ ith , that is before the Jordan .
so he went and did according to the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; for he went and lived by the bro@@ ok Cher@@ ith , that is before the Jordan .
so he arose and went to Z@@ are@@ ph@@ ath ; and when he came to the gate of the city , behold , a widow was there gathering sticks : and he called to her , and said , " Please get me a little water in a vessel , that I may drink . "
Elijah said to her , " Don '@@ t be afraid . go and do as you have said ; but make me of it a little cake first , and bring it out to me , and afterward make some for you and for your son .
for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , ' The jar of meal shall not empty , neither shall the jar of oil fail , until the day that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h sends rain on the earth . ' "
the jar of meal did@@ n '@@ t empty , neither did the jar of oil fail , according to the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke by Elijah .
he stretched himself on the child three times , and cried to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and said , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h my God , please let this child 's soul come into him again . "
Elijah took the child , and brought him down out of the room into the house , and delivered him to his mother ; and Elijah said , " Be@@ hold , your son lives . "
for it was so , when J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel cut off the prophets of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that Ob@@ adi@@ ah took one hundred prophets , and hid them by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water . )
A@@ hab said to Ob@@ adi@@ ah , " Go through the land , to all the springs of water , and to all the bro@@ o@@ ks . perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mul@@ es alive , that we not lose all the animals . "
as Ob@@ adi@@ ah was in the way , behold , Elijah met him : and he recognized him , and fell on his face , and said , " Is it you , my lord Elijah ? "
now you say , ' Go , tell your lord , " Be@@ hold , Elijah is here " ; ' and he will kill me . "
Elijah said , " As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies lives , before whom I stand , I will surely show myself to him today . "
it happened , when A@@ hab saw Elijah , that A@@ hab said to him , " Is that you , you troubl@@ er of Israel ? "
he answered , " I have not troubled Israel ; but you , and your father 's house , in that you have for@@ s@@ aken the commandments of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and you have followed the Ba@@ als .
now therefore send , and gather to me all Israel to Mount Car@@ me@@ l , and four hundred fifty of the prophets of Ba@@ al , and four hundred of the prophets of the Ash@@ er@@ ah , who eat at J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel 's table . "
you call on the name of your god , and I will call on the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . the God who answers by fire , let him be God . " all the people answered , " It is well said . "
Elijah said to the prophets of Ba@@ al , " Choose one bull for yourselves , and dress it first ; for you are many ; and call on the name of your god , but put no fire under it . "
it was so , when mid@@ day was past , that they prophe@@ si@@ ed until the time of the offering of the offering ; but there was neither voice , nor any to answer , nor any who regarded .
Elijah said to all the people , " Come near to me " ; and all the people came near to him . he repaired the altar of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h that was thrown down .
with the stones he built an altar in the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . he made a t@@ rench around the altar , large enough to contain two measures of seed .
then the fire of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h fell , and consumed the burnt offering , and the wood , and the stones , and the dust , and lic@@ ked up the water that was in the t@@ rench .
when all the people saw it , they fell on their faces . they said , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , he is God ! Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , he is God ! "
Elijah said to them , " Se@@ ize the prophets of Ba@@ al ! Don '@@ t let one of them escape ! " they seized them . Elijah brought them down to the bro@@ ok K@@ ish@@ on , and killed them there .
Elijah said to A@@ hab , " Get up , eat and drink ; for there is the sound of abundance of rain . "
so A@@ hab went up to eat and to drink . Elijah went up to the top of Car@@ me@@ l ; and he bowed himself down on the earth , and put his face between his knees .
he said to his servant , " Go up now , look toward the sea . " he went up , and looked , and said , " There is nothing . " he said , " Go again " seven times .
the hand of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was on Elijah ; and he t@@ ucked his cloak into his belt and ran before A@@ hab to the entrance of J@@ ez@@ re@@ el .
he lay down and slept under a j@@ uni@@ per tree ; and behold , an angel touched him , and said to him , " A@@ rise and eat ! "
he looked , and behold , there was at his head a cake baked on the co@@ als , and a jar of water . he ate and drank , and lay down again .
the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came again the second time , and touched him , and said , " A@@ rise and eat , because the journey is too great for you . "
he came there to a cave , and lodged there ; and behold , the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came to him , and he said to him , " What are you doing here , Elijah ? "
it was so , when Elijah heard it , that he wrapped his face in his mantle , and went out , and stood in the entrance of the cave . behold , a voice came to him , and said , " What are you doing here , Elijah ? "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to him , " Go , return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus . when you arrive , you shall ano@@ int Haz@@ ael to be king over Syria .
he left the ox@@ en , and ran after Elijah , and said , " Let me please kiss my father and my mother , and then I will follow you . " he said to him , " Go back again ; for what have I done to you ? "
Ben had@@ ad the king of Syria gathered all his army together ; and there were thirty @@@ -@@ @ two kings with him , and horses and ch@@ ari@@ ots : and he went up and be@@ sieg@@ ed Sam@@ aria , and fought against it .
the king of Israel answered , " It is according to your saying , my lord , O king . I am yours , and all that I have . "
Ben had@@ ad sent to him , and said , " The gods do so to me , and more also , if the dust of Sam@@ aria shall suffice for hand@@ ful@@ s for all the people who follow me . "
behold , a prophet came near to A@@ hab king of Israel , and said , " Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' Have you seen all this great multitude ? behold , I will deliver it into your hand this day ; and you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . ' "
he said , " If they have come out for peace , take them alive ; or if they have come out for war , take them alive . "
the prophet came near to the king of Israel , and said to him , " Go , strengthen yourself , and mark , and see what you do ; for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against you . "
but the rest fled to Ap@@ he@@ k , into the city ; and the wall fell on twenty @@@ -@@ @ seven thousand men who were left . Ben had@@ ad fled , and came into the city , into an inner room .
a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow by the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " Please strike me ! " the man refused to strike him .
then he said to him , " Because you have not obeyed the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , behold , as soon as you are departed from me , a lion shall kill you . " as soon as he was departed from him , a lion found him , and killed him .
as your servant was busy here and there , he was gone . " the king of Israel said to him , " So your judgment shall be ; you yourself have decided it . "
he hur@@ ried , and took the head@@ band away from his eyes ; and the king of Israel recognized that he was of the prophets .
he said to him , " Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' Because you have let go out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction , therefore your life shall go for his life , and your people for his people . ' "
it happened after these things , that Nab@@ o@@ th the J@@ ez@@ re@@ elite had a viney@@ ard , which was in J@@ ez@@ re@@ el , hard by the palace of A@@ hab king of Sam@@ aria .
Nab@@ o@@ th said to A@@ hab , " May Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h forbid me , that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you ! "
so she wrote letters in A@@ hab 's name , and sealed them with his seal , and sent the letters to the elders and to the no@@ bles who were in his city , who lived with Nab@@ o@@ th .
the men of his city , even the elders and the no@@ bles who lived in his city , did as J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel had sent to them , according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them .
it happened , when J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel heard that Nab@@ o@@ th was st@@ oned , and was dead , that J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel said to A@@ hab , " A@@ rise , take possession of the viney@@ ard of Nab@@ o@@ th the J@@ ez@@ re@@ elite , which he refused to give you for money ; for Nab@@ o@@ th is not alive , but dead . "
it happened , when A@@ hab heard that Nab@@ o@@ th was dead , that A@@ hab rose up to go down to the viney@@ ard of Nab@@ o@@ th the J@@ ez@@ re@@ elite , to take possession of it .
" arise , go down to meet A@@ hab king of Israel , who d@@ wells in Sam@@ aria . behold , he is in the viney@@ ard of Nab@@ o@@ th , where he has gone down to take possession of it .
A@@ hab said to Elijah , " Have you found me , my enemy ? " he answered , " I have found you , because you have sold yourself to do that which is evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
I will make your house like the house of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , and like the house of Ba@@ asha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger , and have made Israel to sin . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h also spoke of J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel , saying , " The dogs shall eat J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel by the ram@@ part of J@@ ez@@ re@@ el .
the dogs will eat he who dies of A@@ hab in the city ; and the birds of the sky will eat he who dies in the field . "
he did very ab@@ om@@ in@@ ably in following idols , according to all that the A@@ mor@@ ites did , whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h cast out before the children of Israel .
" see how A@@ hab hum@@ bles himself before me ? because he hum@@ bles himself before me , I will not bring the evil in his days ; but in his son 's days will I bring the evil on his house . "
the king of Israel said to his servants , " You know that Ram@@ o@@ th Gil@@ e@@ ad is ours , and we are still , and don '@@ t take it out of the hand of the king of Syria ? "
Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at said to the king of Israel , " Please inqu@@ ire first for the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
now the king of Israel and Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Jud@@ ah were sitting each on his throne , ar@@ ra@@ yed in their robes , in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Sam@@ aria ; and all the prophets were proph@@ es@@ ying before them .
Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the son of Chen@@ a@@ an@@ ah made him horns of iron , and said , " Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' With these you shall push the Syrians , until they are consumed . ' "
all the prophets prophe@@ si@@ ed so , saying , " Go up to Ram@@ o@@ th Gil@@ e@@ ad , and prosper ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will deliver it into the hand of the king . "
the messenger who went to call Mic@@ aiah spoke to him , saying , " See now , the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth . please let your word be like the word of one of them , and speak good . "
the king said to him , " How many times do I have to ad@@ j@@ ure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ? "
now therefore , behold , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken evil concerning you . "
then Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the son of Chen@@ a@@ an@@ ah came near , and struck Mic@@ aiah on the cheek , and said , " Which way did the Spirit of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h go from me to speak to you ? "
the king of Israel said , " Take Mic@@ aiah , and carry him back to Am@@ on the governor of the city , and to Jo@@ ash the king 's son .
say , ' Th@@ us says the king , " P@@ ut this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of afflic@@ tion and with water of afflic@@ tion , until I come in peace . " ' "
Mic@@ aiah said , " If you return at all in peace , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has not spoken by me . " he said , " List@@ en , all you people ! "
the king of Israel said to Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , " I will disguise myself , and go into the battle ; but you put on your robes . " the king of Israel disguised himself , and went into the battle .
it happened , when the cap@@ tains of the ch@@ ari@@ ots saw Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , that they said , " Su@@ rely that is the king of Israel ! " and they turned aside to fight against him . Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at cried out .
the battle increased that day . the king was pro@@ pped up in his ch@@ ari@@ ot facing the Syrians , and died at evening . the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the ch@@ ari@@ ot .
they washed the ch@@ ari@@ ot by the pool of Sam@@ aria ; and the dogs lic@@ ked up his blood where the prostitutes washed themselves ; according to the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h which he spoke .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ hab , and all that he did , and the iv@@ ory house which he built , and all the cities that he built , are@@ n '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ icles of the kings of Israel ?
Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at was thirty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name was Az@@ ub@@ ah the daughter of Sh@@ il@@ hi .
he walked in all the way of As@@ a his father ; He did@@ n '@@ t turn aside from it , doing that which was right in the eyes of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : however the high places were not taken away ; the people still sacrificed and burnt inc@@ ense in the high places .
the remn@@ ant of the so@@ dom@@ ites , that remained in the days of his father As@@ a , he put away out of the land .
he served Ba@@ al , and worshi@@ ped him , and provoked to anger Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , according to all that his father had done .
A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah fell down through the lat@@ tice in his upper room that was in Sam@@ aria , and was sick . so he sent messengers , and said to them , " Go , inqu@@ ire of Ba@@ al Ze@@ bu@@ b , the god of Ek@@ ron , whether I will recover of this sickness . "
now therefore thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " You shall not come down from the bed where you have gone up , but shall surely die . " ' " Elijah departed .
the messengers returned to him , and he said to them , " Why is it that you have returned ? "
he said to them , " What kind of man was he who came up to meet you , and told you these words ? "
they answered him , " He was a hair@@ y man , and wearing a leather belt around his waist . " he said , " It is Elijah the T@@ ish@@ bite . "
Elijah answered to the captain of fifty , " If I am a man of God , let fire come down from the sky , and consume you and your fifty ! " fire came down from the sky , and consumed him and his fifty .
again he sent to him another captain of fifty and his fifty . he answered him , " Man of God , the king has said , ' Come down quickly ! ' "
Elijah answered them , " If I am a man of God , let fire come down from the sky , and consume you and your fifty ! " the fire of God came down from the sky , and consumed him and his fifty .
the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Elijah , " Go down with him . Don '@@ t be afraid of him . " he arose , and went down with him to the king .
Elijah said to Elis@@ ha , " Please wait here , for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has sent me as far as Be@@ the@@ l . " Elis@@ ha said , " As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , and as your soul lives , I will not leave you . " so they went down to Be@@ the@@ l .
the sons of the prophets who were at Be@@ the@@ l came out to Elis@@ ha , and said to him , " Do you know that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will take away your master from your head today ? " he said , " Yes , I know it ; hold your peace . "
Elijah said to him , " Elis@@ ha , please wait here , for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has sent me to Jer@@ ich@@ o . " he said , " As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , and as your soul lives , I will not leave you . " so they came to Jer@@ ich@@ o .
the sons of the prophets who were at Jer@@ ich@@ o came near to Elis@@ ha , and said to him , " Do you know that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will take away your master from your head today ? " he answered , " Yes , I know it . hold your peace . "
Elijah said to him , " Please wait here , for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has sent me to the Jordan . " he said , " As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , and as your soul lives , I will not leave you . " they both went on .
fifty men of the sons of the prophets went , and stood opposite them at a distance ; and they both stood by the Jordan .
Elijah took his mantle , and wrapped it together , and struck the waters , and they were divided here and there , so that they two went over on dry ground .
it happened , when they had gone over , that Elijah said to Elis@@ ha , " As@@ k what I shall do for you , before I am taken from you . " Elis@@ ha said , " Please let a double portion of your spirit be on me . "
he said , " You have asked a hard thing . if you see me when I am taken from you , it shall be so for you ; but if not , it shall not be so . "
it happened , as they still went on , and talked , that behold , a ch@@ ari@@ ot of fire and horses of fire separated them ; and Elijah went up by a whir@@ l@@ wind into heaven .
he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him , and went back , and stood by the bank of the Jordan .
when the sons of the prophets who were at Jer@@ ich@@ o over against him saw him , they said , " The spirit of Elijah rests on Elis@@ ha . " they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
they came back to him , while he stayed at Jer@@ ich@@ o ; and he said to them , " did@@ n '@@ t I tell you , ' Don '@@ t go ? ' "
the men of the city said to Elis@@ ha , " Be@@ hold , please , the situation of this city is pleasant , as my lord sees ; but the water is bad , and the land mis@@ carries . "
he said , " B@@ ring me a new jar , and put salt in it . " they brought it to him .
he went out to the spring of the waters , and threw salt into it , and said , " Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' I have healed these waters . there shall not be from there any more death or mis@@ carrying . ' "
he went up from there to Be@@ the@@ l . as he was going up by the way , some youths came out of the city and mo@@ cked him , and said to him , " Go up , you Bal@@ dy ! go up , you bal@@ d@@ head ! "
he looked behind him and saw them , and cur@@ sed them in the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . two female bears came out of the woods , and ma@@ ul@@ ed forty @@@ -@@ @ two of those youths .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , but not like his father , and like his mother ; for he put away the pillar of Ba@@ al that his father had made .
nevertheless he held to the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , with which he made Israel to sin ; he did@@ n '@@ t depart from it .
now Mes@@ ha king of Mo@@ ab was a sheep bre@@ eder ; and he rendered to the king of Israel the wool of one hundred thousand lam@@ bs , and of one hundred thousand r@@ ams .
so the king of Israel went , and the king of Jud@@ ah , and the king of E@@ dom ; and they made a circuit of seven days ' journey . there was no water for the army , nor for the animals that followed them .
the king of Israel said , " Al@@ as ! for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Mo@@ ab . "
but Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at said , " is@@ n '@@ t there here a prophet of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that we may inqu@@ ire of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h by him ? " one of the king of Israel 's servants answered , " Elis@@ ha the son of Sha@@ ph@@ at is here , who poured water on the hands of Elijah . "
Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at said , " The word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is with him . " so the king of Israel and Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at and the king of E@@ dom went down to him .
Elis@@ ha said , " As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies lives , before whom I stand , surely , were it not that I respect the presence of Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Jud@@ ah , I would not look toward you , nor see you .
but now bring me a min@@ stre@@ l . " it happened , when the min@@ stre@@ l played , that the hand of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came on him .
for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' You will not see wind , neither will you see rain ; yet that valley shall be filled with water , and you will drink , both you and your livestock and your animals .
you shall strike every fortified city , and every choice city , and shall fell every good tree , and stop all springs of water , and mar every good piece of land with stones . ' "
they rose up early in the morning , and the sun shone on the water , and the Mo@@ ab@@ ites saw the water over against them as red as blood .
they said , " This is blood . the kings are surely destroyed , and they have struck each other . now therefore , Mo@@ ab , to the spoil ! "
when the king of Mo@@ ab saw that the battle was too severe for him , he took with him seven hundred men who drew sword , to break through to the king of E@@ dom ; but they could not .
then he took his el@@ dest son who would have re@@ igned in his place , and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall . there was great wrath against Israel : and they departed from him , and returned to their own land .
Elis@@ ha said to her , " What shall I do for you ? tell me : what do you have in the house ? " she said , " Your hand@@ maid has nothing in the house , except a pot of oil . "
so she went from him , and shut the door on her and on her sons ; they brought the containers to her , and she poured out .
he said , " What then is to be done for her ? " Ge@@ haz@@ i answered , " Most certainly she has no son , and her husband is old . "
he said , " At this season , when the time comes around , you will embrace a son . " she said , " No , my lord , you man of God , do not lie to your hand@@ maid . "
when the child was grown , it happened one day that he went out to his father to the re@@ apers .
he said , " Why would you want go to him today ? it is neither new moon nor Sabbath . " she said , " It 's al@@ right . "
please run now to meet her , and ask her , ' Is it well with you ? is it well with your husband ? is it well with the child ? ' " she answered , " It is well . "
the mother of the child said , " As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , and as your soul lives , I will not leave you . " he arose , and followed her .
Ge@@ haz@@ i passed on before them , and laid the staff on the face of the child ; but there was neither voice , nor hearing . therefore he returned to meet him , and told him , saying , " The child has not awakened . "
he went up , and lay on the child , and put his mouth on his mouth , and his eyes on his eyes , and his hands on his hands . he stretched himself on him ; and the flesh of the child grew warm .
then he returned , and walked in the house once back and forth ; and went up , and stretched himself on him . then the child sne@@ ezed seven times , and the child opened his eyes .
he called Ge@@ haz@@ i , and said , " Call this S@@ hun@@ amm@@ ite ! " so he called her . when she had come in to him , he said , " Take up your son . "
then she went in , and fell at his feet , and bowed herself to the ground ; and she took up her son , and went out .
Elis@@ ha came again to Gil@@ gal . there was a famine in the land ; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him ; and he said to his servant , " Set on the great pot , and boil ste@@ w for the sons of the prophets . "
but he said , " Then bring meal . " he cast it into the pot ; and he said , " P@@ our out for the people , that they may eat . " there was no harm in the pot .
his servant said , " What , should I set this before a hundred men ? " but he said , " Gi@@ ve the people , that they may eat ; for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' They will eat , and will have some left over . ' "
so he set it before them , and they ate , and left some of it , according to the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
now Na@@ aman , captain of the army of the king of Syria , was a great man with his master , and honorable , because by him Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had given victory to Syria : he was also a mighty man of val@@ or , but he was a le@@ per .
the king of Syria said , " Go now , and I will send a letter to the king of Israel . " he departed , and took with him ten talents of silver , and six thousand pieces of gold , and ten changes of clothing .
he brought the letter to the king of Israel , saying , " Now when this letter has come to you , behold , I have sent Na@@ aman my servant to you , that you may heal him of his le@@ pro@@ sy . "
it was so , when Elis@@ ha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes , that he sent to the king , saying , " Why have you torn your clothes ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel . "
Elis@@ ha sent a messenger to him , saying , " Go and wash in the Jordan seven times , and your flesh shall come again to you , and you shall be clean . "
but Na@@ aman was angry , and went away , and said , " Be@@ hold , I thought , ' He will surely come out to me , and stand , and call on the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God , and wave his hand over the place , and heal the le@@ per . '
are@@ n '@@ t A@@ ban@@ ah and Phar@@ par , the rivers of Damascus , better than all the waters of Israel ? cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t I wash in them , and be clean ? " so he turned and went away in a rage .
then went he down , and di@@ pped himself seven times in the Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God ; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
so Ge@@ haz@@ i followed after Na@@ aman . when Na@@ aman saw one running after him , he came down from the ch@@ ari@@ ot to meet him , and said , " Is all well ? "
when he came to the hill , he took them from their hand , and stored them in the house . then he let the men go , and they departed .
but he went in , and stood before his master . Elis@@ ha said to him , " Where did you come from , Ge@@ haz@@ i ? " he said , " Your servant went nowhere . "
the sons of the prophets said to Elis@@ ha , " See now , the place where we dwell before you is too small for us .
the man of God asked , " Where did it fall ? " he showed him the place . he cut down a stick , threw it in there , and made the iron float .
the heart of the king of Syria was very troubled about this . he called his servants , and said to them , " W@@ on '@@ t you show me which of us is for the king of Israel ? "
he said , " Go and see where he is , that I may send and get him . " it was told him , saying , " Be@@ hold , he is in Do@@ than . "
therefore he sent horses , ch@@ ari@@ ots , and a great army there . they came by night , and surrounded the city .
when the servant of the man of God had risen early , and gone out , behold , an army with horses and ch@@ ari@@ ots was around the city . his servant said to him , " Al@@ as , my master ! what shall we do ? "
when they came down to him , Elis@@ ha prayed to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and said , " Please strike this people with blindness . " he struck them with blindness according to the word of Elis@@ ha .
it happened , when they had come into Sam@@ aria , that Elis@@ ha said , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , open the eyes of these men , that they may see . " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h opened their eyes , and they saw ; and behold , they were in the midst of Sam@@ aria .
there was a great famine in Sam@@ aria . behold , they be@@ sieg@@ ed it , until a don@@ key 's head was sold for eighty pieces of silver , and the fourth part of a K@@ ab of do@@ ve 's d@@ ung for five pieces of silver .
he said , " If Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h do@@ es@@ n '@@ t help you , from where could I help you ? from of the thresh@@ ing floor , or from the win@@ ep@@ ress ? "
while he was still talking with them , behold , the messenger came down to him . then he said , " Be@@ hold , this evil is from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . why should I wait for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h any longer ? "
Elis@@ ha said , " He@@ ar the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' Tom@@ orrow about this time a measure of fine flour will be sold for a she@@ kel , and two measures of barley for a she@@ kel , in the gate of Sam@@ aria . ' "
now there were four le@@ pr@@ ous men at the entrance of the gate . they said one to another , " Why do we sit here until we die ?
they rose up in the tw@@ ilight , to go to the camp of the Syrians . when they had come to the ou@@ ter@@ most part of the camp of the Syrians , behold , there was no man there .
they went after them to the Jordan ; and behold , all the way was full of garments and vessels , which the Syrians had cast away in their ha@@ ste . the messengers returned , and told the king .
the people went out , and pl@@ under@@ ed the camp of the Syrians . so a measure of fine flour was sold for a she@@ kel , and two measures of barley for a she@@ kel , according to the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
the king appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to be in charge of the gate : and the people tro@@ d on him in the gate , and he died as the man of God had said , who spoke when the king came down to him .
the woman arose , and did according to the word of the man of God . she went with her household , and lived in the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines seven years .
now the king was talking with Ge@@ haz@@ i the servant of the man of God , saying , " Please tell me all the great things that Elis@@ ha has done . "
the king said to Haz@@ ael , " Take a present in your hand , and go , meet the man of God , and inqu@@ ire of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h by him , saying , ' Will I recover from this sickness ? ' "
Elis@@ ha said to him , " Go , tell him , ' You shall surely recover ; ' however Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has shown me that he shall surely die . "
Haz@@ ael said , " But what is your servant , who is but a dog , that he should do this great thing ? " Elis@@ ha answered , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has shown me that you will be king over Syria . "
then he departed from Elis@@ ha , and came to his master , who said to him , " What did Elis@@ ha say to you ? " he answered , " He told me that you would surely recover . "
it happened on the next day , that he took a thick cloth , di@@ pped it in water , and spread it on his face , so that he died . then Haz@@ ael re@@ igned in his place .
in the fifth year of Jor@@ am the son of A@@ hab king of Israel , Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at being king of Jud@@ ah then , Je@@ hor@@ am the son of Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at king of Jud@@ ah began to reign .
then Jor@@ am passed over to Z@@ air , and all his ch@@ ari@@ ots with him : and he rose up by night , and struck the E@@ dom@@ ites who surrounded him , and the cap@@ tains of the ch@@ ari@@ ots ; and the people fled to their tents .
in the twel@@ fth year of Jor@@ am the son of A@@ hab king of Israel , A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ hor@@ am king of Jud@@ ah began to reign .
twenty @@@ -@@ @ two years old was A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned one year in Jerusalem . his mother 's name was Ath@@ ali@@ ah the daughter of Om@@ ri king of Israel .
Elis@@ ha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets , and said to him , " P@@ ut your belt on your waist , take this vial of oil in your hand , and go to Ram@@ o@@ th Gil@@ e@@ ad .
when you come there , find Je@@ hu the son of Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the son of N@@ im@@ sh@@ i , and go in , and make him arise up from among his brothers , and carry him to an inner room .
then take the vial of oil , and pour it on his head , and say , ' Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " I have ano@@ inted you king over Israel . " ' then open the door , flee , and don '@@ t wait . "
he arose , and went into the house . then he poured the oil on his head , and said to him , " Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , ' I have ano@@ inted you king over the people of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , even over Israel .
you shall strike the house of A@@ hab your master , that I may av@@ enge the blood of my servants the prophets , and the blood of all the servants of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , at the hand of J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel .
I will make the house of A@@ hab like the house of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , and like the house of Ba@@ asha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah .
then Je@@ hu came forth to the servants of his lord : and one said to him , " Is all well ? why did this mad fellow come to you ? " he said to them , " You know the man and what his talk was . "
then they hur@@ ried , and took every man his garment , and put it under him on the top of the stairs , and blew the trum@@ pet , saying , " Je@@ hu is king . "
now the watch@@ man was standing on the tower in J@@ ez@@ re@@ el , and he sp@@ ied the company of Je@@ hu as he came , and said , " I see a company . " Jor@@ am said , " Take a hor@@ sem@@ an , and send to meet them , and let him say , ' Is it peace ? ' "
then he sent out a second on horse@@ back , who came to them , and said , " Th@@ us says the king , ' Is it peace ? ' " Je@@ hu answered , " What do you have to do with peace ? fall in behind me ! "
Jor@@ am said , " Get ready ! " they got his ch@@ ari@@ ot ready . Jor@@ am king of Israel and A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah went out , each in his ch@@ ari@@ ot , and they went out to meet Je@@ hu , and found him in the portion of Nab@@ o@@ th the J@@ ez@@ re@@ elite .
it happened , when Jor@@ am saw Je@@ hu , that he said , " Is it peace , Je@@ hu ? " he answered , " What peace , so long as the prostitution of your mother J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel and her wit@@ ch@@ craft abound ? "
he lifted up his face to the window , and said , " Who is on my side ? who ? " two or three e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s looked out at him .
when he had come in , he ate and drink ; and he said , " See now to this cur@@ sed woman , and bury her ; for she is a king 's daughter . "
therefore they came back , and told him . he said , " This is the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke by his servant Elijah the T@@ ish@@ bite , saying , ' The dogs will eat the flesh of J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel on the plot of J@@ ez@@ re@@ el ,
now A@@ hab had seventy sons in Sam@@ aria . Je@@ hu wrote letters , and sent to Sam@@ aria , to the rulers of J@@ ez@@ re@@ el , even the elders , and to those who brought up the sons of A@@ hab , saying ,
but they were exceedingly afraid , and said , " Be@@ hold , the two kings did@@ n '@@ t stand before him ! how then shall we stand ? "
it happened , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and killed them , even seventy persons , and put their heads in bas@@ kets , and sent them to him to J@@ ez@@ re@@ el .
a messenger came , and told him , " They have brought the heads of the king 's sons . " he said , " L@@ ay them in two he@@ aps at the entrance of the gate until the morning . "
it happened in the morning , that he went out , and stood , and said to all the people , " You are righteous . behold , I con@@ spi@@ red against my master , and killed him ; but who struck all these ?
know now that nothing shall fall to the earth of the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke concerning the house of A@@ hab . for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has done that which he spoke by his servant Elijah . "
when he came to Sam@@ aria , he struck all who remained to A@@ hab in Sam@@ aria , until he had destroyed him , according to the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke to Elijah .
Je@@ hu gathered all the people together , and said to them , " A@@ hab served Ba@@ al a little ; but Je@@ hu will serve him much .
Je@@ hu sent through all Israel ; and all the worshi@@ ppers of Ba@@ al came , so that there was not a man left that did@@ n '@@ t come . they came into the house of Ba@@ al ; and the house of Ba@@ al was filled from one end to another .
however from the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , with which he made Israel to sin , Je@@ hu did@@ n '@@ t depart from after them , the golden cal@@ ves that were in Be@@ the@@ l , and that were in Dan .
but Je@@ hu took no heed to walk in the law of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , with all his heart . he did@@ n '@@ t depart from the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am , with which he made Israel to sin .
from the Jordan eastward , all the land of Gil@@ e@@ ad , the G@@ ad@@ ites , and the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites , and the Man@@ ass@@ ites , from A@@ ro@@ er , which is by the valley of the Ar@@ non , even Gil@@ e@@ ad and Bash@@ an .
in the seventh year Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada sent and fetched the cap@@ tains over hundreds of the Car@@ ites and of the guard , and brought them to him into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and he made a covenant with them , and took an oath of them in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and showed them the king 's son .
he commanded them , saying , " This is the thing that you shall do : a third part of you , who come in on the Sabbath , shall be keepers of the watch of the king 's house ;
a third part shall be at the gate Su@@ r ; and a third part at the gate behind the guard . so you shall keep the watch of the house , and be a barrier .
the two companies of you , even all who go out on the Sabbath , shall keep the watch of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h around the king .
the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the altar and the house , around the king .
then he brought out the king 's son , and put the crown on him , and gave him the testimony ; and they made him king , and ano@@ inted him ; and they cl@@ apped their hands , and said , " Long live the king ! "
in the seventh year of Je@@ hu began Je@@ ho@@ ash to reign ; and he re@@ igned forty years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Zi@@ bi@@ ah of Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba .
however the high places were not taken away ; the people still sacrificed and burnt inc@@ ense in the high places .
let the priests take it to them , every man from his acquaintance ; and they shall repair the breaches of the house , wherever any breach shall be found . "
and to the mas@@ ons and the stone cut@@ ters , and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the breaches of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it .
but there were not made for the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h cups of silver , sn@@ u@@ ff@@ ers , basins , trum@@ pets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ;
moreover they did@@ n '@@ t demand an accounting from the men into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work ; for they dealt faithfully .
the money for the t@@ resp@@ ass offerings , and the money for the sin offerings , was not brought into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : it was the priests ' .
for Jo@@ z@@ ac@@ ar the son of Shim@@ e@@ ath , and Je@@ ho@@ z@@ abad the son of Sh@@ om@@ er , his servants , struck him , and he died ; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David : and Ama@@ zi@@ ah his son re@@ igned in his place .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and followed the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , with which he made Israel to sin ; he did@@ n '@@ t depart from it .
nevertheless they did@@ n '@@ t depart from the sins of the house of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am , with which he made Israel to sin , but walked therein : and there remained the Ash@@ er@@ ah also in Sam@@ aria . )
for he did@@ n '@@ t leave to Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz of the people any more than fifty hor@@ sem@@ en , and ten ch@@ ari@@ ots , and ten thousand foot@@ men ; for the king of Syria destroyed them , and made them like the dust in thresh@@ ing .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; he did@@ n '@@ t depart from all the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , with which he made Israel to sin ; but he walked therein .
now the rest of the acts of Jo@@ ash , and all that he did , and his might with which he fought against Ama@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , are@@ n '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ icles of the kings of Israel ?
now Elis@@ ha was fallen sick of his sickness of which he died : and Jo@@ ash the king of Israel came down to him , and we@@ pt over him , and said , " My father , my father , the ch@@ ari@@ ots of Israel and its hor@@ sem@@ en ! "
he said to the king of Israel , " P@@ ut your hand on the bow " ; and he put his hand on it . Elis@@ ha laid his hands on the king 's hands .
he said , " Take the arrows " ; and he took them . he said to the king of Israel , " Stri@@ ke the ground " ; and he struck three times , and stopped .
the man of God was angry with him , and said , " You should have struck five or six times . then you would have struck Syria until you had consumed it , whereas now you shall strike Syria just three times . "
but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was gr@@ acious to them , and had compassion on them , and had respect to them , because of his covenant with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and would not destroy them , neither cast he them from his presence as yet .
Je@@ ho@@ ash the son of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz took again out of the hand of B@@ enh@@ ad@@ ad the son of Haz@@ ael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz his father by war . Jo@@ ash struck him three times , and recovered the cities of Israel .
he was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned twenty @@@ -@@ @ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Je@@ ho@@ add@@ in of Jerusalem .
however the high places were not taken away : the people still sacrificed and burnt inc@@ ense in the high places .
it happened , as soon as the kingdom was established in his hand , that he killed his servants who had sl@@ ain the king his father :
then Ama@@ zi@@ ah sent messengers to Je@@ ho@@ ash , the son of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz son of Je@@ hu , king of Israel , saying , " Come , let us look one another in the face . "
but Ama@@ zi@@ ah would not listen . so Je@@ ho@@ ash king of Israel went up ; and he and Ama@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah looked one another in the face at B@@ eth Sh@@ em@@ esh , which belongs to Jud@@ ah .
Je@@ ho@@ ash king of Israel took Ama@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , the son of Je@@ ho@@ ash the son of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , at B@@ eth Sh@@ em@@ esh , and came to Jerusalem , and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to the corner gate , four hundred cub@@ its .
he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and in the treasures of the king 's house , the hostages also , and returned to Sam@@ aria .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ ash which he did , and his might , and how he fought with Ama@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , are@@ n '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ icles of the kings of Israel ?
all the people of Jud@@ ah took Az@@ ari@@ ah , who was sixteen years old , and made him king in the place of his father Ama@@ zi@@ ah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : he did@@ n '@@ t depart from all the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , with which he made Israel to sin .
for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h saw the afflic@@ tion of Israel , that it was very bitter ; for there was none shut up nor left at large , neither was there any hel@@ per for Israel .
sixteen years old was he when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned fifty @@@ -@@ @ two years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was J@@ ec@@ oli@@ ah of Jerusalem .
however the high places were not taken away : the people still sacrificed and burnt inc@@ ense in the high places .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h struck the king , so that he was a le@@ per to the day of his death , and lived in a separate house . Jo@@ th@@ am the king 's son was over the household , judging the people of the land .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , as his fathers had done : he did@@ n '@@ t depart from the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , with which he made Israel to sin .
this was the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h which he spoke to Je@@ hu , saying , " Your sons to the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel . " so it came to pass .
Sh@@ all@@ um the son of Jab@@ esh began to reign in the thirty @@@ -@@ @ ninth year of Uz@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah ; and he re@@ igned for a month in Sam@@ aria .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : he did@@ n '@@ t depart all his days from the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , with which he made Israel to sin .
Men@@ a@@ hem exac@@ ted the money of Israel , even of all the mighty men of wealth , of each man fifty she@@ k@@ els of silver , to give to the king of As@@ sy@@ ria . so the king of As@@ sy@@ ria turned back , and did@@ n '@@ t stay there in the land .
Hos@@ he@@ a the son of E@@ lah made a conspiracy against Pe@@ k@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah , and struck him , and killed him , and re@@ igned in his place , in the twentieth year of Jo@@ th@@ am the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah .
he was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jer@@ usha the daughter of Z@@ ad@@ ok .
however the high places were not taken away : the people still sacrificed and burned inc@@ ense in the high places . he built the upper gate of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
twenty years old was A@@ haz when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and he did@@ n '@@ t do that which was right in the eyes of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God , like David his father .
A@@ haz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and sent it for a present to the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
the king of As@@ sy@@ ria listened to him ; and the king of As@@ sy@@ ria went up against Damascus , and took it , and carried its people captive to K@@ ir , and killed Re@@ zin .
King A@@ haz went to Damascus to meet Tig@@ l@@ ath pil@@ es@@ er king of As@@ sy@@ ria , and saw the altar that was at Damascus ; and king A@@ haz sent to Uri@@ jah the priest the fashion of the altar , and its pattern , according to all its work@@ manship .
Uri@@ jah the priest built an altar : according to all that king A@@ haz had sent from Damascus , so Uri@@ jah the priest made it for the coming of king A@@ haz from Damascus .
he burnt his burnt offering and his meal offering , and poured his drink offering , and sprink@@ led the blood of his peace offerings , on the altar .
King A@@ haz cut off the panels of the bases , and removed the basin from off them , and took down the sea from off the bronze ox@@ en that were under it , and put it on a pav@@ ement of stone .
in the ninth year of Hos@@ he@@ a the king of As@@ sy@@ ria took Sam@@ aria , and carried Israel away to As@@ sy@@ ria , and placed them in Hal@@ ah , and on the Hab@@ or , the river of Go@@ zan , and in the cities of the Med@@ es .
it was so , because the children of Israel had sin@@ ned against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God , who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt , and had feared other gods ,
and walked in the statutes of the nations , whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h cast out from before the children of Israel , and of the kings of Israel , which they made .
the children of Israel did secretly things that were not right against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God : and they built them high places in all their cities , from the tower of the watch@@ men to the fortified city ;
and there they burnt inc@@ ense in all the high places , as did the nations whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h carried away before them ; and they worked wicked things to provoke Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to anger ;
and they served idols , of which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had said to them , " You shall not do this thing . "
they for@@ s@@ ook all the commandments of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God , and made them mol@@ ten images , even two cal@@ ves , and made an Ash@@ er@@ ah , and worshi@@ ped all the army of the sky , and served Ba@@ al .
they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire , and used div@@ ination and enchan@@ tments , and sold themselves to do that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to provoke him to anger .
for he t@@ ore Israel from the house of David ; and they made J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat king : and J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am drove Israel from following Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and made them sin a great sin .
so it was , at the beginning of their dwelling there , that they did@@ n '@@ t fear Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : therefore Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h sent lions among them , which killed some of them .
then the king of As@@ sy@@ ria commanded , saying , " Car@@ ry there one of the priests whom you brought from there ; and let them go and dwell there , and let him teach them the law of the god of the land . "
however every nation made gods of their own , and put them in the houses of the high places which the Sam@@ ar@@ it@@ ans had made , every nation in their cities in which they lived .
and the Av@@ v@@ ites made Ni@@ b@@ haz and Tar@@ ta@@ k ; and the Sep@@ harv@@ ites burnt their children in the fire to A@@ dram@@ m@@ elec@@ h and An@@ amm@@ elec@@ h , the gods of Sep@@ harv@@ aim .
so they feared Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and made to them from among themselves priests of the high places , who sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places .
they feared Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and served their own gods , after the ways of the nations from among whom they had been carried away .
but you shall fear Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God ; and he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies . "
now it happened in the third year of Hos@@ he@@ a son of E@@ lah king of Israel , that He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah the son of A@@ haz king of Jud@@ ah began to reign .
he was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned twenty @@@ -@@ @ nine years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Ab@@ i the daughter of Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah .
he removed the high places , and broke the pillars , and cut down the Ash@@ er@@ ah : and he broke in pieces the bronze ser@@ pent that Moses had made ; for in those days the children of Israel burned inc@@ ense to it ; and he called it Ne@@ h@@ ush@@ tan .
he trusted in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel ; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Jud@@ ah , nor among them that were before him .
it happened in the fourth year of king He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , which was the seventh year of Hos@@ he@@ a son of E@@ lah king of Israel , that Shal@@ man@@ es@@ er king of As@@ sy@@ ria came up against Sam@@ aria , and be@@ sieg@@ ed it .
at the end of three years they took it : in the sixth year of He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , which was the ninth year of Hos@@ he@@ a king of Israel , Sam@@ aria was taken .
the king of As@@ sy@@ ria carried Israel away to As@@ sy@@ ria , and put them in Hal@@ ah , and on the Hab@@ or , the river of Go@@ zan , and in the cities of the Med@@ es ,
now in the four@@ teenth year of king He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , Sen@@ n@@ ach@@ eri@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ria came up against all the fortified cities of Jud@@ ah , and took them .
at that time , He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah cut off the gold from the doors of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's temple , and from the pillars which He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah had over@@ laid , and gave it to the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
when they had called to the king , there came out to them Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of Hil@@ ki@@ ah , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ n@@ ah the scri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah the son of As@@ ap@@ h the recorder .
Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h said to them , " S@@ ay now to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , ' Th@@ us says the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , " What confidence is this in which you trust ?
you say ( but they are but vain words ) , ' There is counsel and strength for war . ' now on whom do you trust , that you have reb@@ elled against me ?
now , behold , you trust in the staff of this bru@@ ised re@@ ed , even in Egypt . if a man leans on it , it will go into his hand , and pi@@ erce it . so is Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him .
now therefore , please give pledges to my master the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , and I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able on your part to set riders on them .
then Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of Hil@@ ki@@ ah , and She@@ b@@ n@@ ah , and Jo@@ ah , said to Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h , " Please speak to your servants in the Syrian language ; for we understand it . Don '@@ t speak with us in the Jews ' language , in the hearing of the people who are on the wall . "
then Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h stood , and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and spoke , saying , " He@@ ar the word of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
thus says the king , ' Don '@@ t let He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah deceive you ; for he will not be able to deliver you out of his hand .
neither let He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah make you trust in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , saying , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will surely deliver us , and this city shall not be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria . "
Don '@@ t listen to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah . ' for thus says the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , ' Make your peace with me , and come out to me ; and everyone of you eat of his vine , and everyone of his fi@@ g tree , and everyone drink the waters of his own ci@@ stern ;
where are the gods of Ham@@ ath , and of Ar@@ pad ? where are the gods of Sep@@ harv@@ aim , of Hen@@ a , and Iv@@ v@@ ah ? have they delivered Sam@@ aria out of my hand ?
who are they among all the gods of the countries , that have delivered their country out of my hand , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand ? ' "
but the people held their peace , and answered him not a word ; for the king 's commandment was , " Don '@@ t answer him . "
it happened , when king He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah heard it , that he t@@ ore his clothes , and covered himself with s@@ ack@@ cloth , and went into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
he sent Eli@@ ak@@ im , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the scri@@ be , and the elders of the priests , covered with s@@ ack@@ cloth , to Isaiah the prophet the son of A@@ mo@@ z .
'@@ Th@@ us you shall speak to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , saying , " Don '@@ t let your God in whom you trust deceive you , saying , Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
incl@@ ine your ear , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and hear . open your eyes , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and see . hear the words of Sen@@ n@@ ach@@ eri@@ b , with which he has sent to defy the living God .
and have cast their gods into the fire ; for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone . therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God , save us , I beg you , out of his hand , that all the king@@ doms of the earth may know that you , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , are God alone . "
then Isaiah the son of A@@ mo@@ z sent to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , saying , " Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , ' W@@ here@@ as you have prayed to me against Sen@@ n@@ ach@@ eri@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ria , I have heard you .
this is the word that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken concerning him : " the virgin daughter of Z@@ ion has desp@@ ised you and ridicul@@ ed you . the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you .
whom have you de@@ fied and bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed ? against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high ? against the Holy One of Israel .
I have dug and drunk strange waters , and with the sole of my feet will I dry up all the rivers of Egypt . '
haven '@@ t you heard how I have done it long ago , and formed it of ancient times ? now have I brought it to pass , that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ru@@ inous he@@ aps .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power . they were dis@@ may@@ ed and conf@@ ounded . they were like the grass of the field , and like the green her@@ b , like the grass on the hous@@ et@@ ops , and like grain b@@ lasted before it has grown up .
" therefore thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h concerning the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , ' He shall not come to this city , nor shoot an arrow there , neither shall he come before it with shield , nor cast up a m@@ ound against it .
by the way that he came , by the same shall he return , and he shall not come to this city , ' says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
'@@ For I will defend this city to save it , for my own sake , and for my servant David 's sake . ' "
in those days was He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah sick to death . Isaiah the prophet the son of A@@ mo@@ z came to him , and said to him , " Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' Set your house in order ; for you shall die , and not live . ' "
" remember now , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , I beg you , how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in your sight . " He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah we@@ pt bit@@ terly .
I will add to your days fifteen years . I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria . I will defend this city for my own sake , and for my servant David 's sake . " ' "
He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah said to Isaiah , " What shall be the sign that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will heal me , and that I shall go up to the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h the third day ? "
Isaiah said , " This shall be the sign to you from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will do the thing that he has spoken : shall the shadow go forward ten steps , or go back ten steps ? "
He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah answered , " It is a light thing for the shadow to go forward ten steps . n@@ ay , but let the shadow return backward ten steps . "
then Isaiah the prophet came to king He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , and said to him , " What did these men say ? from where did they come to you ? " He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah said , " They have come from a far country , even from Babylon . "
'@@ Be@@ hold , the days come , that all that is in your house , and that which your fathers have laid up in store to this day , shall be carried to Babylon . nothing shall be left , ' says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was twelve years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned fifty @@@ -@@ @ five years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was H@@ eph@@ zi@@ ba@@ h .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , after the ab@@ om@@ inations of the nations whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h cast out before the children of Israel .
for he built again the high places which He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah his father had destroyed ; and he re@@ ared up al@@ t@@ ars for Ba@@ al , and made an Ash@@ er@@ ah , as did A@@ hab king of Israel , and worshi@@ ped all the army of the sky , and served them .
I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Sam@@ aria , and the plum@@ met of the house of A@@ hab ; and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wi@@ pes a dish , wi@@ ping it and turning it upside down .
I will cast off the remn@@ ant of my inheritance , and deliver them into the hand of their enemies . they will become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies ;
because they have done that which is evil in my sight , and have provoked me to anger , since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt , even to this day . ' "
moreover Man@@ as@@ se@@ h shed innocent blood very much , until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another ; besides his sin with which he made Jud@@ ah to sin , in doing that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
now the rest of the acts of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and all that he did , and his sin that he sin@@ ned , are@@ n '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ icles of the kings of Jud@@ ah ?
Am@@ on was twenty @@@ -@@ @ two years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned two years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lem@@ eth the daughter of Har@@ u@@ z of J@@ ot@@ ba@@ h .
but the people of the land killed all those who had con@@ spi@@ red against king Am@@ on ; and the people of the land made Jo@@ si@@ ah his son king in his place .
Jo@@ si@@ ah was eight years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned thirty @@@ -@@ @ one years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was J@@ edi@@ d@@ ah the daughter of Ad@@ aiah of Bo@@ z@@ k@@ ath .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and walked in all the way of David his father , and did@@ n '@@ t turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
it happened in the eighteenth year of king Jo@@ si@@ ah , that the king sent Sha@@ ph@@ an , the son of Az@@ ali@@ ah the son of M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lam , the scri@@ be , to the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , saying ,
" go up to Hil@@ ki@@ ah the high priest , that he may sum the money which is brought into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which the keepers of the threshold have gathered of the people .
to the carp@@ enters , and to the builders , and to the mas@@ ons , and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the house .
Hil@@ ki@@ ah the high priest said to Sha@@ ph@@ an the scri@@ be , " I have found the book of the law in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . " Hil@@ ki@@ ah delivered the book to Sha@@ ph@@ an , and he read it .
Sha@@ ph@@ an the scri@@ be came to the king , and brought the king word again , and said , " Your servants have emp@@ tied out the money that was found in the house , and have delivered it into the hand of the work@@ men who have the oversight of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
Sha@@ ph@@ an the scri@@ be told the king , saying , " Hil@@ ki@@ ah the priest has delivered a book to me . " Sha@@ ph@@ an read it before the king .
the king commanded Hil@@ ki@@ ah the priest , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and Ach@@ b@@ or the son of Mic@@ aiah , and Sha@@ ph@@ an the scri@@ be , and As@@ aiah the king 's servant , saying ,
" thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' Be@@ hold , I will bring evil on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the words of the book which the king of Jud@@ ah has read .
he brought out the Ash@@ er@@ ah from the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , outside of Jerusalem , to the bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and burned it at the bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , and beat it to dust , and cast its dust on the graves of the common people .
nevertheless the priests of the high places did@@ n '@@ t come up to the altar of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in Jerusalem , but they ate un@@ leav@@ ened bread among their brothers .
he de@@ filed T@@ oph@@ eth , which is in the valley of the children of H@@ inno@@ m , that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Mol@@ ech .
as Jo@@ si@@ ah turned himself , he sp@@ ied the tom@@ bs that were there in the mountain ; and he sent , and took the bones out of the tom@@ bs , and burned them on the altar , and de@@ filed it , according to the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h which the man of God proclaimed , who proclaimed these things .
he said , " Let him be ! let no man move his bones . " so they let his bones alone , with the bones of the prophet who came out of Sam@@ aria .
the king commanded all the people , saying , " Keep the Pas@@ sover to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , as it is written in this book of the covenant . "
surely there was not kept such a Pas@@ sover from the days of the judges who judged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Jud@@ ah ;
notwithstanding , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h did@@ n '@@ t turn from the fierc@@ eness of his great wrath , with which his anger was kind@@ led against Jud@@ ah , because of all the provocation with which Man@@ as@@ se@@ h had provoked him .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , " I will remove Jud@@ ah also out of my sight , as I have removed Israel , and I will cast off this city which I have chosen , even Jerusalem , and the house of which I said , ' My name shall be there . ' "
Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz was twenty @@@ -@@ @ three years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned three months in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Ham@@ ut@@ al the daughter of Jer@@ emi@@ ah of Lib@@ n@@ ah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , according to all that his fathers had done .
Phar@@ aoh Nec@@ oh put him in bonds at Ri@@ b@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath , that he might not reign in Jerusalem ; and put the land to a tribute of one hundred talents of silver , and a talent of gold .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned eleven years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Ze@@ bid@@ ah the daughter of Ped@@ aiah of Rum@@ ah .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , according to all that his fathers had done .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h sent against him bands of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and bands of the Syrians , and bands of the Mo@@ ab@@ ites , and bands of the children of Am@@ mon , and sent them against Jud@@ ah to destroy it , according to the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke by his servants the prophets .
surely at the commandment of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came this on Jud@@ ah , to remove them out of his sight , for the sins of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , according to all that he did ,
and also for the innocent blood that he shed ; for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood : and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h would not pardon .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in was eighteen years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned in Jerusalem three months : and his mother 's name was Ne@@ h@@ ush@@ ta the daughter of El@@ na@@ than of Jerusalem .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , according to all that his father had done .
and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in the king of Jud@@ ah went out to the king of Babylon , he , and his mother , and his servants , and his princes , and his officers : and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign .
he carried out there all the treasures of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the treasures of the king 's house , and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold , which Solomon king of Israel had made in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's temple , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had said .
he carried away all Jerusalem , and all the princes , and all the mighty men of val@@ or , even ten thousand cap@@ tives , and all the craftsmen and the s@@ mi@@ ths ; none remained , except the poorest sort of the people of the land .
he carried away Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in to Babylon ; and the king 's mother , and the king 's wives , and his officers , and the chief men of the land , carried he into cap@@ tivity from Jerusalem to Babylon .
all the men of might , even seven thousand , and the craftsmen and the s@@ mi@@ ths one thousand , all of them strong and apt for war , even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon .
the king of Babylon made M@@ att@@ ani@@ ah , Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in 's father 's brother , king is his place , and changed his name to Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah .
Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah was twenty @@@ -@@ @ one years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned eleven years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Ham@@ ut@@ al the daughter of Jer@@ emi@@ ah of Lib@@ n@@ ah .
for through the anger of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , it happened in Jerusalem and Jud@@ ah , until he had cast them out from his presence . Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah reb@@ elled against the king of Babylon .
it happened in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon came , he and all his army , against Jerusalem , and enc@@ amped against it ; and they built for@@ ts against it around it .
but the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans pursued after the king , and over@@ took him in the plains of Jer@@ ich@@ o ; and all his army was scattered from him .
then they took the king , and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Ri@@ b@@ lah ; and they gave judgment on him .
they killed the sons of Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah , and bound him in fet@@ ters , and carried him to Babylon .
now in the fifth month , on the seventh day of the month , which was the nineteenth year of king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar , king of Babylon , came Ne@@ bu@@ z@@ ar@@ adan the captain of the guard , a servant of the king of Babylon , to Jerusalem .
he burnt the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jerusalem , even every great house , burnt he with fire .
but the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to work the vineyards and fields .
the Chal@@ de@@ ans broke up the pillars of brass that were in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and carried the brass pieces to Babylon .
the height of the one pillar was eighteen cub@@ its , and a capital of brass was on it ; and the height of the capital was three cub@@ its , with network and p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates on the capital around it , all of brass : and like to these had the second pillar with network .
the king of Babylon struck them , and put them to death at Ri@@ b@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath . so Jud@@ ah was carried away captive out of his land .
as for the people who were left in the land of Jud@@ ah , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon had left , even over them he made G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , governor .
but it happened in the seventh month , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ ani@@ ah , the son of Elis@@ h@@ ama , of the royal seed came , and ten men with him , and struck G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , so that he died , and the Jews and the Chal@@ de@@ ans that were with him at M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h .
all the people , both small and great , and the cap@@ tains of the forces , arose , and came to Egypt ; for they were afraid of the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
the sons of Jap@@ h@@ eth : Gom@@ er , and Mag@@ og , and Mad@@ ai , and Jav@@ an , and tu@@ bal , and M@@ esh@@ ech , and Tir@@ as .
the sons of C@@ ush : Se@@ ba , and Hav@@ il@@ ah , and Sab@@ ta , and Ra@@ ama , and Sab@@ tec@@ a . the sons of Ra@@ am@@ ah : She@@ ba , and D@@ ed@@ an .
C@@ ush became the father of N@@ im@@ rod ; he began to be a mighty one in the earth .
the sons of She@@ m : EL@@ AM , and As@@ sh@@ ur , and Ar@@ p@@ ach@@ s@@ had , and Lu@@ d , and A@@ ram , and U@@ z , and Hu@@ l , and ge@@ ther , and M@@ esh@@ ech .
to E@@ ber were born two sons : the name of the one was P@@ ele@@ g ; for in his days the earth was divided ; and his brother 's name was Jo@@ k@@ tan .
the sons of K@@ et@@ ur@@ ah , Abraham 's conc@@ ub@@ ine : she bore Zim@@ ran , and Jo@@ k@@ shan , and Med@@ an , and Mi@@ dian , and I@@ sh@@ b@@ ak , and Shu@@ ah . the sons of Jo@@ k@@ shan : She@@ ba , and D@@ ed@@ an .
the sons of Mi@@ dian : ep@@ ha@@ h , and E@@ ph@@ er , and H@@ ano@@ ch , and Ab@@ ida , and El@@ da@@ ah . all these were the sons of K@@ et@@ ur@@ ah .
the sons of Se@@ ir : Lot@@ an , and Sho@@ bal , and Zi@@ be@@ on , and An@@ ah , and D@@ ish@@ on , and E@@ zer , and D@@ ish@@ an .
the sons of Sho@@ bal : Ali@@ an , and Man@@ ah@@ ath , and E@@ bal , Sh@@ eph@@ i , and On@@ am . the sons of Zi@@ be@@ on : Ai@@ ah , and An@@ ah .
the sons of An@@ ah : D@@ ish@@ on . the sons of D@@ ish@@ on : Ham@@ ran , and E@@ sh@@ ban , and I@@ thr@@ an , and Cher@@ an .
now these are the kings who re@@ igned in the land of E@@ dom , before there re@@ igned any king over the children of Israel : Bel@@ a the son of Be@@ or ; and the name of his city was D@@ inhab@@ ah .
Hus@@ ham died , and had@@ ad the son of Bed@@ ad , who struck Mi@@ dian in the field of Mo@@ ab , re@@ igned in his place ; and the name of his city was Av@@ ith .

of the Lev@@ ites : Sh@@ em@@ aiah the son of Has@@ shu@@ b , the son of Az@@ ri@@ k@@ am , the son of H@@ ash@@ ab@@ i@@ ah , of the sons of Mer@@ ari ;
and Bak@@ bak@@ kar , Her@@ esh , and Gal@@ al , and M@@ att@@ ani@@ ah the son of Mic@@ a , the son of Z@@ ich@@ ri , the son of As@@ ap@@ h ,

who previously served in the king 's gate eastward : they were the porters for the camp of the children of Lev@@ i .
all these who were chosen to be porters in the thresholds were two hundred and twelve . these were reck@@ oned by gen@@ eal@@ ogy in their villages , whom David and Samuel the se@@ er ordained in their office of trust .
for the four chief porters , who were Lev@@ ites , were in an office of trust , and were over the rooms and over the treas@@ uries in God 's house .
certain of them were in charge of the vessels of service ; for by count were these brought in and by count were these taken out .
these are the singers , heads of fathers ' households of the Lev@@ ites , who lived in the rooms and were free from other service ; for they were employed in their work day and night .
Az@@ el had six sons , whose names are these : Az@@ ri@@ k@@ am , Bo@@ cher@@ u , and I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , and S@@ hear@@ i@@ ah , and Ob@@ adi@@ ah , and Han@@ an : these were the sons of Az@@ el .
now the Phil@@ ist@@ ines fought against Israel : and the men of Israel fled from before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and fell down sl@@ ain on Mount Gil@@ bo@@ a .
the Phil@@ ist@@ ines followed hard after Saul and after his sons ; and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines killed Jonathan , and Ab@@ in@@ ad@@ ab , and Mal@@ ch@@ ish@@ ua , the sons of Saul .
when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , they for@@ s@@ ook their cities , and fled ; and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came and lived in them .
it happened on the next day , when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came to strip the sl@@ ain , that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gil@@ bo@@ a .
they stripped him , and took his head , and his armor , and sent into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines all around , to carry the news to their idols , and to the people .
all the val@@ i@@ ant men arose , and took away the body of Saul , and the bodies of his sons , and brought them to Jab@@ esh , and buried their bones under the oak in Jab@@ esh , and fast@@ ed seven days .
so Saul died for his t@@ resp@@ ass which he committed against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , because of the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he did@@ n '@@ t keep ; and also because he asked counsel of one who had a familiar spirit , to inqu@@ ire ,
now these are the chief of the mighty men whom David had , who showed themselves strong with him in his kingdom , together with all Israel , to make him king , according to the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h concerning Israel .
this is the number of the mighty men whom David had : Jas@@ ho@@ beam , the son of a H@@ ach@@ mon@@ ite , the chief of the thirty ; he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred and killed them at one time .
he was with David at Pas@@ dam@@ mi@@ m , and there the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were gathered together to battle , where there was a plot of ground full of barley ; and the people fled from before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
they stood in the midst of the plot , and defended it , and killed the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h saved them by a great victory .
three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Ad@@ ul@@ lam ; and the army of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were enc@@ amped in the valley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
David long@@ ed , and said , " Oh that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem , which is by the gate ! "
the three broke through the army of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but David would not drink of it , but poured it out to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ,
Ab@@ is@@ hai , the brother of Jo@@ ab , he was chief of the three ; for he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred and killed them , and had a name among the three .
Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , the son of a val@@ i@@ ant man of Kab@@ ze@@ el , who had done mighty deeds , he killed the two sons of Ari@@ el of Mo@@ ab : he went down also and killed a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow .
behold , he was more honorable than the thirty , but he did@@ n '@@ t attain to the three : and David set him over his guard .
Zel@@ ek the Am@@ mon@@ ite , Na@@ har@@ ai the Ber@@ oth@@ ite , the armor be@@ arer of Jo@@ ab the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah ,
now these are those who came to David to Z@@ ik@@ lag , while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of K@@ ish ; and they were among the mighty men , his help@@ ers in war .
the chief was A@@ hi@@ ez@@ er ; then Jo@@ ash , the sons of Sh@@ em@@ a@@ ah the Gi@@ be@@ ath@@ ite , and J@@ ez@@ iel , and Pel@@ et , the sons of Az@@ m@@ av@@ eth , and Ber@@ ac@@ ah , and Je@@ hu the An@@ ath@@ oth@@ ite ,
and I@@ sh@@ m@@ aiah the Gi@@ be@@ on@@ ite , a mighty man among the thirty , and over the thirty , and Jer@@ emi@@ ah , and Ja@@ haz@@ iel , and Johan@@ an , and Jo@@ z@@ abad the G@@ ed@@ er@@ ath@@ ite ,
of the G@@ ad@@ ites there separated themselves to David to the strongh@@ old in the wilderness , mighty men of val@@ or , men trained for war , that could handle shield and spe@@ ar ; whose faces were like the faces of lions , and they were as swift as the ro@@ es on the mountains ;
as he went to Z@@ ik@@ lag , there fell to him of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , Ad@@ n@@ ah , and Jo@@ z@@ abad , and J@@ edi@@ ael , and Michael , and Jo@@ z@@ abad , and Eli@@ hu , and Z@@ il@@ le@@ th@@ ai , cap@@ tains of thousands who were of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
they helped David against the band of ro@@ vers : for they were all mighty men of val@@ or , and were cap@@ tains in the army .
and Z@@ ad@@ ok , a young man mighty of val@@ or , and of his father 's house twenty @@@ -@@ @ two cap@@ tains .
of the half @@@ -@@ @ tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h eighteen thousand , who were mentioned by name , to come and make David king .
of the children of Is@@ sac@@ har , men who had understanding of the times , to know what Israel ought to do , their heads were two hundred ; and all their brothers were at their commandment .
all these being men of war , who could order the battle array , came with a perfect heart to He@@ br@@ on , to make David king over all Israel : and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king .
and let us bring again the ark of our God to us . for we did@@ n '@@ t seek it in the days of Saul . "
so David assembled all Israel together , from the Shi@@ h@@ or the bro@@ ok of Egypt even to the entrance of Ham@@ ath , to bring the ark of God from Kiri@@ ath j@@ ear@@ im .
David went up , and all Israel , to Ba@@ al@@ ah , that is , to Kiri@@ ath j@@ ear@@ im , which belonged to Jud@@ ah , to bring up from there the ark of God Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h that sits above the cher@@ ub@@ im , that is called by the Name .
David and all Israel played before God with all their might , even with songs , and with har@@ ps , and with str@@ ing@@ ed instruments , and with t@@ amb@@ our@@ ines , and with cy@@ mb@@ als , and with trum@@ pets .
the ark of God remained with the family of O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom in his house three months : and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h blessed the house of O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom , and all that he had .
these are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem : Sham@@ mu@@ a , and Sho@@ ba@@ b , Na@@ than , and Solomon ,
David inqui@@ red of God , saying , " Sh@@ all I go up against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ? will you deliver them into my hand ? " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to him , " Go up ; for I will deliver them into your hand . "
David inqui@@ red again of God ; and God said to him , " You shall not go up after them . turn away from them , and come on them over against the mul@@ berry trees .
David made him houses in the city of David ; and he prepared a place for the ark of God , and pit@@ ched for it a tent .
then David said , " No one ought to carry the ark of God but the Lev@@ ites . for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has chosen them to carry the ark of God , and to minister to him forever . "
the children of the Lev@@ ites bore the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles there@@ on , as Moses commanded according to the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
David spoke to the chief of the Lev@@ ites to appoint their brothers the singers , with instruments of music , str@@ ing@@ ed instruments and har@@ ps and cy@@ mb@@ als , sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy .
and with them their brothers of the second degree , Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , Ben , and Ja@@ az@@ iel , and Sh@@ em@@ ir@@ am@@ o@@ th , and Je@@ hi@@ el , and Un@@ ni , Eli@@ ab , and Ben@@ aiah , and Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah , and Mat@@ ti@@ thi@@ ah , and Eli@@ ph@@ ele@@ hu , and Mik@@ nei@@ ah , and O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom , and J@@ ei@@ el , the door@@ keepers .
and Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , and Az@@ iel , and Sh@@ em@@ ir@@ am@@ o@@ th , and Je@@ hi@@ el , and Un@@ ni , and Eli@@ ab , and Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah , and Ben@@ aiah , with str@@ ing@@ ed instruments set to Al@@ am@@ o@@ th ;
and Mat@@ ti@@ thi@@ ah , and Eli@@ ph@@ ele@@ hu , and Mik@@ nei@@ ah , and O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom , and J@@ ei@@ el , and Az@@ az@@ i@@ ah , with har@@ ps tuned to the eight @@@ -@@ @ str@@ ing@@ ed ly@@ re , to lead .
Chen@@ ani@@ ah , chief of the Lev@@ ites , was over the song : he instructed about the song , because he was skillful .
She@@ ban@@ i@@ ah , and Jos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , and N@@ eth@@ an@@ el , and A@@ mas@@ ai , and Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , and Ben@@ aiah , and Eli@@ ez@@ er , the priests , blew the trum@@ pets before the ark of God : and O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom and Je@@ hi@@ ah were door@@ keepers for the ark .
it happened , when God helped the Lev@@ ites who bore the ark of the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that they sacrificed seven bul@@ ls and seven r@@ ams .
David was clo@@ thed with a robe of fine linen , and all the Lev@@ ites who bore the ark , and the singers , and Chen@@ ani@@ ah the master of the song with the singers : and David had on him an ep@@ ho@@ d of linen .
it happened , as the ark of the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came to the city of David , that Mic@@ h@@ al the daughter of Saul looked out at the window , and saw king David dancing and playing ; and she desp@@ ised him in her heart .
they brought in the ark of God , and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pit@@ ched for it : and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God .
he dealt to everyone of Israel , both man and woman , to every one a lo@@ af of bread , and a portion of meat , and a cake of ra@@ is@@ ins .
As@@ ap@@ h the chief , and second to him Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , J@@ ei@@ el , and Sh@@ em@@ ir@@ am@@ o@@ th , and Je@@ hi@@ el , and Mat@@ ti@@ thi@@ ah , and Eli@@ ab , and Ben@@ aiah , and O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom , and J@@ ei@@ el , with str@@ ing@@ ed instruments and with har@@ ps ; and As@@ ap@@ h with cy@@ mb@@ als , sounding aloud ;
Oh give thanks to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . call on his name . make his do@@ ings known among the peoples .
he confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute , and to Israel for an everlasting covenant ,
let the heavens be glad , and let the earth rejoice ! let them say among the nations , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h re@@ igns ! "
say , " Save us , God of our salvation ! gather us together and deliver us from the nations , to give thanks to your holy name , to triumph in your praise . "
blessed be Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , from everlasting even to everlasting . all the people said , " A@@ men , " and praised Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
so he left there , before the ark of the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , As@@ ap@@ h and his brothers , to minister before the ark continually , as every day 's work required ;
and Z@@ ad@@ ok the priest , and his brothers the priests , before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in the high place that was at Gi@@ be@@ on ,
to offer burnt offerings to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h on the altar of burnt offering continually morning and evening , even according to all that is written in the law of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he commanded to Israel ;
and with them h@@ eman and J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n , and the rest who were chosen , who were mentioned by name , to give thanks to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , because his loving kindness endu@@ res forever ;
and with them h@@ eman and J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n with trum@@ pets and cy@@ mb@@ als for those that should sound aloud , and with instruments for the songs of God ; and the sons of J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n to be at the gate .
" go and tell David my servant , ' Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " You shall not build me a house to dwell in ;
I have been with you wherever you have gone , and have cut off all your enemies from before you . I will make you a name , like the name of the great ones who are in the earth .
it shall happen , when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers , that I will set up your seed after you , who shall be of your sons ; and I will establish his kingdom .
then David the king went in , and sat before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and he said , " Who am I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h God , and what is my house , that you have brought me thus far ?
this was a small thing in your eyes , God ; but you have spoken of your servant 's house for a great while to come , and have respected me according to the estate of a man of high degree , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h God .
what can David say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant ? for you know your servant .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , for your servant 's sake , and according to your own heart , you have worked all this greatness , to make known all these great things .
now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant , that it may continue forever before you ; for you , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have blessed , and it is blessed forever . "
David took from him one thousand ch@@ ari@@ ots , and seven thousand hor@@ sem@@ en , and twenty thousand foot@@ men ; and David ham@@ str@@ ung all the ch@@ ari@@ ot horses , but reserved of them for one hundred ch@@ ari@@ ots .
from Ti@@ b@@ hath and from Cu@@ n , cities of Had@@ ad@@ ez@@ er , David took very much brass , with which Solomon made the bronze sea , and the pillars , and the vessels of brass .
King David also dedicated these to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , with the silver and the gold that he carried away from all the nations ; from E@@ dom , and from Mo@@ ab , and from the children of Am@@ mon , and from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and from A@@ mal@@ ek .
and Z@@ ad@@ ok the son of Ah@@ it@@ u@@ b , and Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h the son of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar , were priests ; and Sha@@ v@@ sha was scri@@ be ;
and Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada was over the Cher@@ eth@@ ites and the Pel@@ eth@@ ites ; and the sons of David were chief about the king .
so H@@ anu@@ n took David 's servants , and sha@@ ved them , and cut off their garments in the middle , even to their but@@ to@@ cks , and sent them away .
when the children of Am@@ mon saw that they had made themselves o@@ dious to David , H@@ anu@@ n and the children of Am@@ mon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire them ch@@ ari@@ ots and hor@@ sem@@ en out of Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , and out of Ar@@ am@@ ma@@ ac@@ ah , and out of Z@@ ob@@ ah .
so they hired for themselves thirty @@@ -@@ @ two thousand ch@@ ari@@ ots , and the king of Ma@@ ac@@ ah and his people , who came and enc@@ amped before Me@@ deb@@ a . the children of Am@@ mon gathered themselves together from their cities , and came to battle .
now when Jo@@ ab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind , he chose of all the choice men of Israel , and put them in array against the Syrians .
he said , " If the Syrians are too strong for me , then you are to help me ; but if the children of Am@@ mon are too strong for you , then I will help you .
when the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel , they sent messengers , and drew forth the Syrians who were beyond the River , with Shop@@ h@@ ach the captain of the army of Had@@ ad@@ ez@@ er at their head .
it was told David ; and he gathered all Israel together , and passed over the Jordan , and came on them , and set the battle in array against them . so when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians , they fought with him .
the Syrians fled before Israel ; and David killed of the Syrians the men of seven thousand ch@@ ari@@ ots , and forty thousand foot@@ men , and killed Shop@@ h@@ ach the captain of the army .
he brought forth the people who were therein , and cut them with s@@ aws , and with iron picks , and with axes . David did so to all the cities of the children of Am@@ mon . David and all the people returned to Jerusalem .
it happened after this , that there arose war at Ge@@ zer with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : then Sib@@ bec@@ ai the Hus@@ ha@@ th@@ ite killed Si@@ p@@ pa@@ i , of the sons of the giant ; and they were subdued .
there was again war at G@@ ath , where there was a man of great stature , whose fingers and toes were twenty @@@ -@@ @ four , six on each hand , and six on each foot ; and he also was born to the giant .
these were born to the giant in G@@ ath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
David said to Jo@@ ab and to the princes of the people , " Go , number Israel from Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba even to Dan ; and bring me word , that I may know the sum of them . "
Jo@@ ab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David . all those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew sword : and in Jud@@ ah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew sword .
" go and speak to David , saying , ' Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " I offer you three things . choose one of them , that I may do it to you . " ' "
David said to G@@ ad , " I am in distress . let me fall , I pray , into the hand of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; for his mer@@ cies are very great . let me not fall into the hand of man . "
then the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h commanded G@@ ad to tell David that David should go up , and raise an altar to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in the thresh@@ ing floor of Or@@ nan the Je@@ bus@@ ite .
Or@@ nan turned back , and saw the angel ; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves . now Or@@ nan was thresh@@ ing wheat .
as David came to Or@@ nan , Or@@ nan looked and saw David , and went out of the thresh@@ ing floor , and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground .
Or@@ nan said to David , " Take it for yourself , and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes . behold , I give the ox@@ en for burnt offerings , and the thresh@@ ing instruments for wood , and the wheat for the meal offering . I give it all . "
King David said to Or@@ nan , " No ; but I will most certainly buy it for the full price . for I will not take that which is yours for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , nor offer a burnt offering without cost . "
David built an altar to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h there , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings , and called on Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering .
for the tab@@ ern@@ acle of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which Moses made in the wilderness , and the altar of burnt offering , were at that time in the high place at Gi@@ be@@ on .
but David cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t go before it to inqu@@ ire of God ; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
David gave orders to gather together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel ; and he set mas@@ ons to cut worked stones to build God 's house .
David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates , and for the cou@@ pl@@ ings ; and brass in abundance without weight ;
then he called for Solomon his son , and commanded him to build a house for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
David said to Solomon his son , " As for me , it was in my heart to build a house to the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h my God .
behold , a son shall be born to you , who shall be a man of rest . I will give him rest from all his enemies all around ; for his name shall be Solomon , and I will give peace and qui@@ et@@ ness to Israel in his days .
he shall build a house for my name ; and he shall be my son , and I will be his father ; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever . '
may Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h give you discretion and understanding , and put you in charge of Israel ; that so you may keep the law of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
then you will prosper , if you observe to do the statutes and the ordin@@ ances which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h gave Moses concerning Israel . be strong , and courageous . Don '@@ t be afraid , neither be dis@@ may@@ ed .
" is@@ n '@@ t Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God with you ? h@@ as@@ n '@@ t he given you rest on every side ? for he has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand ; and the land is subdued before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and before his people .
now David was old and full of days ; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel .
J@@ ah@@ ath was the chief , and Z@@ iz@@ ah the second : but Je@@ ush and B@@ eri@@ ah did@@ n '@@ t have many sons ; therefore they became a fathers ' house in one reckoning .
the sons of Am@@ ram : Aaron and Moses ; and Aaron was separated , that he should sancti@@ fy the most holy things , he and his sons , forever , to burn inc@@ ense before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to minister to him , and to bless in his name , forever .
for by the last words of David the sons of Lev@@ i were numbered , from twenty years old and upward .
and to offer all burnt offerings to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , on the Sab@@ baths , on the new mo@@ ons , and on the set fe@@ asts , in number according to the ordin@@ ance concerning them , continually before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ;
these were the divisions of the sons of Aaron . the sons of Aaron : Nad@@ ab and A@@ bi@@ hu , Ele@@ az@@ ar and I@@ th@@ am@@ ar .
David with Z@@ ad@@ ok of the sons of Ele@@ az@@ ar , and A@@ him@@ elec@@ h of the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , divided them according to their ordering in their service .
this was their ordering in their service , to come into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h according to the ordin@@ ance given to them by Aaron their father , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , had commanded him .
of the rest of the sons of Lev@@ i : of the sons of Am@@ ram , Sh@@ ub@@ ael ; of the sons of Sh@@ ub@@ ael , Je@@ h@@ de@@ i@@ ah .
of J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n ; the sons of J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n : G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , and Z@@ eri , and Jes@@ ha@@ i@@ ah , H@@ ash@@ ab@@ i@@ ah , and Mat@@ ti@@ thi@@ ah , six , under the hands of their father J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n with the har@@ p , who prophe@@ si@@ ed in giving thanks and pra@@ ising Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
all these were the sons of h@@ eman the king 's se@@ er in the words of God , to lift up the horn . God gave to h@@ eman fourteen sons and three daughters .
the number of them , with their brothers who were instructed in singing to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , even all who were skillful , was two hundred eighty @@@ -@@ @ eight .
they cast lots for their offices , all alike , as well the small as the great , the teacher as the scholar .
for the divisions of the door@@ keepers : of the Kor@@ ah@@ ites , Mes@@ hel@@ emi@@ ah the son of K@@ ore , of the sons of As@@ ap@@ h .
O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom had sons : Sh@@ em@@ aiah the fir@@ st@@ born , Je@@ ho@@ z@@ abad the second , Jo@@ ah the third , and Sac@@ ar the fourth , and N@@ eth@@ an@@ el the fifth ,
also to Sh@@ em@@ aiah his son were sons born , who ruled over the house of their father ; for they were mighty men of val@@ or .
the sons of Sh@@ em@@ aiah : O@@ th@@ ni , and Rep@@ hael , and O@@ bed , El@@ z@@ abad , whose brothers were val@@ i@@ ant men , Eli@@ hu , and Sem@@ achi@@ ah .
also Hos@@ ah , of the children of Mer@@ ari , had sons : Shim@@ ri the chief , ( for though he was not the fir@@ st@@ born , yet his father made him chief ) ,
of these were the divisions of the door@@ keepers , even of the chief men , having offices like their brothers , to minister in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
of the Lev@@ ites , A@@ hij@@ ah was over the treasures of God 's house , and over the treasures of the dedicated things .
of the He@@ bron@@ ites , H@@ ash@@ ab@@ i@@ ah and his brothers , men of val@@ or , one thousand seven hundred , had the oversight of Israel beyond the Jordan w@@ est@@ ward , for all the business of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and for the service of the king .
over the division of the second month was D@@ od@@ ai the A@@ ho@@ h@@ ite , and his division ; and Mik@@ lo@@ th the ruler : and in his division were twenty @@@ -@@ @ four thousand .
the third captain of the army for the third month was Ben@@ aiah , the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the priest , chief : and in his division were twenty @@@ -@@ @ four thousand .
this is that Ben@@ aiah , who was the mighty man of the thirty , and over the thirty : and of his division was Am@@ m@@ iz@@ abad his son .
the seventh captain for the seventh month was Hel@@ ez the Pel@@ on@@ ite , of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : and in his division were twenty @@@ -@@ @ four thousand .
the eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Ben@@ aiah the Pir@@ ath@@ on@@ ite , of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : and in his division were twenty @@@ -@@ @ four thousand .
of the half @@@ -@@ @ tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in Gil@@ e@@ ad , Id@@ do the son of Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah : of Benjamin , Ja@@ asi@@ el the son of Ab@@ ner :
of Dan , Az@@ arel the son of J@@ ero@@ ham . these were the cap@@ tains of the tribes of Israel .
Jo@@ ab the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah began to number , but did@@ n '@@ t finish ; and there came wrath for this on Israel ; neither was the number put into the account in the chron@@ icles of king David .
over the king 's treasures was Az@@ m@@ av@@ eth the son of A@@ di@@ el : and over the treasures in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the towers , was Jonathan the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah :
and over the herds that fed in Sharon was Sh@@ it@@ ra@@ i the Shar@@ on@@ ite : and over the herds that were in the valleys was Sha@@ ph@@ at the son of Ad@@ la@@ i :
also Jonathan , David 's uncle , was a counsel@@ or , a man of understanding , and a scri@@ be : and Je@@ hi@@ el the son of H@@ ach@@ mon@@ i was with the king 's sons :
and after A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el was Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the son of Ben@@ aiah , and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar : and the captain of the king 's army was Jo@@ ab .
he said to me , ' Solomon , your son , shall build my house and my courts ; for I have chosen him to be my son , and I will be his father .
take heed now ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has chosen you to build a house for the sanctuary . be strong , and do it . "
of gold by weight for the gold , for all vessels of every kind of service ; for all the vessels of silver by weight , for all vessels of every kind of service ;
by weight also for the lam@@ p@@ stands of gold , and for its lamps , of gold , by weight for every lam@@ p@@ stand and for its lamps ; and for the lam@@ p@@ stands of silver , by weight for every lam@@ p@@ stand and for its lamps , according to the use of every lam@@ p@@ stand ;
and the gold by weight for the tables of show bread , for every table ; and silver for the tables of silver ;
and the for@@ ks , and the basins , and the cups , of pure gold ; and for the golden bow@@ ls by weight for every bowl ; and for the silver bow@@ ls by weight for every bowl ;
and for the altar of inc@@ ense refined gold by weight ; and gold for the pattern of the ch@@ ari@@ ot , the cher@@ ub@@ im , that spread out , and covered the ark of the covenant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
even three thousand talents of gold , of the gold of O@@ ph@@ ir , and seven thousand talents of refined silver , with which to over@@ lay the walls of the houses ;
and they gave for the service of God 's house of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand dar@@ ics , and of silver ten thousand talents , and of brass eighteen thousand talents , and of iron a hundred thousand talents .
then the people rejo@@ iced , because they offered willingly , because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : and David the king also rejo@@ iced with great joy .
yours , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , is the greatness , the power , the glory , the victory , and the maj@@ esty ! for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours . yours is the kingdom , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and you are exalted as head above all .
both riches and honor come from you , and you rule over all ; and in your hand is power and might ; and it is in your hand to make great , and to give strength to all .
but who am I , and what is my people , that we should be able to offer so willingly as this ? for all things come from you , and of your own have we given you .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Israel , our fathers , keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people , and prepare their heart for you ;
and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep your commandments , your testim@@ onies , and your statutes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for which I have made provision . "
David said to all the assembly , " Now bless Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God ! " all the assembly blessed Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fathers , and bowed down their heads and pro@@ str@@ ated themselves before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h and the king .
they sacrificed sacrifices to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and offered burnt offerings to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , on the next day after that day , even one thousand bul@@ ls , one thousand r@@ ams , and one thousand lam@@ bs , with their drink offerings , and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel ,
all the princes , the mighty men , and also all of the sons of king David submitted themselves to Solomon the king .
Solomon spoke to all Israel , to the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every prince in all Israel , the heads of the fathers ' households .
so Solomon , and all the assembly with him , went to the high place that was at Gi@@ be@@ on ; for there was the T@@ ent of Meeting of God , which Moses the servant of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had made in the wilderness .
but David had brought the ark of God up from Kiri@@ ath j@@ ear@@ im to the place that David had prepared for it ; for he had pit@@ ched a tent for it at Jerusalem .
moreover the bronze altar , that B@@ ez@@ al@@ el the son of U@@ ri , the son of H@@ ur , had made , was there before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : and Solomon and the assembly were seeking counsel there .
Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which was at the T@@ ent of Meeting , and offered one thousand burnt offerings on it .
now give me wisdom and knowledge , that I may go out and come in before this people ; for who can judge this your people , that is so great ? "
wisdom and knowledge is granted to you . I will give you riches , wealth , and honor , such as none of the kings have had who have been before you ; neither shall there any after you have the like . "
so Solomon came from the high place that was at Gi@@ be@@ on , from before the T@@ ent of Meeting , to Jerusalem ; and he re@@ igned over Israel .
the horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt and from K@@ ue ; the king 's merchants purchased them from K@@ ue .
but who is able to build him a house , since heaven and the heaven of heavens can '@@ t contain him ? who am I then , that I should build him a house , except just to burn inc@@ ense before him ?
" send me also c@@ edar trees , f@@ ir trees , and al@@ gum trees , out of Lebanon ; for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon : and behold , my servants shall be with your servants ,
Hur@@ am continued , " Bless@@ ed be Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , that made heaven and earth , who has given to David the king a wise son , endowed with discretion and understanding , that should build a house for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and a house for his kingdom .
" now therefore the wheat and the barley , the oil and the wine , which my lord has spoken of , let him send to his servants :
and we will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as you shall need ; and we will bring it to you in flo@@ ats by sea to J@@ op@@ pa ; and you shall carry it up to Jerusalem . "
Solomon numbered all the foreigners who were in the land of Israel , after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them ; and they were found one hundred fifty @@@ -@@ @ three thousand six hundred .
he set seventy thousand of them to bear burdens , and eighty thousand who were stone cut@@ ters in the mountains , and three thousand six hundred over@@ se@@ ers to set the people at work .
then Solomon began to build the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h at Jerusalem on Mount M@@ ori@@ ah , where Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h appeared to David his father , which he prepared in the place that David had appointed , in the thresh@@ ing floor of Or@@ nan the Je@@ bus@@ ite .
now these are the foundations which Solomon laid for the building of God 's house . the length by cub@@ its after the first measure was sixty cub@@ its , and the breadth twenty cub@@ its .
the por@@ ch that was in front , its length , according to the breadth of the house , was twenty cub@@ its , and the height one hundred twenty ; and he over@@ laid it within with pure gold .
the greater house he made a ceiling with f@@ ir wood , which he over@@ laid with fine gold , and ornam@@ ented it with palm trees and chains .
he over@@ laid also the house , the beams , the thresholds , and its walls , and its doors , with gold ; and engra@@ ved cher@@ ub@@ im on the walls .
he made the most holy house : its length , according to the breadth of the house , was twenty cub@@ its , and its breadth twenty cub@@ its ; and he over@@ laid it with fine gold , amounting to six hundred talents .
in the most holy house he made two cher@@ ub@@ im of image work ; and they over@@ laid them with gold .
the wings of the cher@@ ub@@ im were twenty cub@@ its long : the wing of the one was five cub@@ its , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cub@@ its , reaching to the wing of the other cher@@ u@@ b .
the wing of the other cher@@ u@@ b was five cub@@ its , reaching to the wall of the house ; and the other wing was five cub@@ its , joining to the wing of the other cher@@ u@@ b .
also he made before the house two pillars of thirty @@@ -@@ @ five cub@@ its high , and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cub@@ its .
he made chains in the or@@ acle , and put them on the tops of the pillars ; and he made one hundred p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates , and put them on the chains .
then he made an altar of brass , twenty cub@@ its its length , and twenty cub@@ its its breadth , and ten cub@@ its its height .
it stood on twelve ox@@ en , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set on them above , and all their hinder parts were inward .
he made the ten lam@@ p@@ stands of gold according to the ordin@@ ance concerning them ; and he set them in the temple , five on the right hand , and five on the left .
he made also ten tables , and placed them in the temple , five on the right side , and five on the left . he made one hundred basins of gold .
Hur@@ am made the pots , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the basins . so Hur@@ am made an end of doing the work that he did for king Solomon in God 's house :
and the four hundred p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates for the two networks ; two rows of p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates for each network , to cover the two bow@@ ls of the capitals that were on the pillars .
Solomon made all the vessels that were in God 's house , the golden altar also , and the tables with the show bread on them ;
and the sn@@ u@@ ff@@ ers , and the basins , and the spo@@ ons , and the fire p@@ ans , of pure gold : and as for the entry of the house , the inner doors of it for the most holy place , and the doors of the main hall of the temple were of gold .
and they brought up the ark , and the T@@ ent of Meeting , and all the holy vessels that were in the T@@ ent ; these the priests the Lev@@ ites brought up .
the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the ark before the or@@ acle ; but they were not seen outside : and there it is to this day .
there was nothing in the ark except the two tables which Moses put at H@@ ore@@ b , when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h made a covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of Egypt .
so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud : for the glory of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h filled God 's house .
but I have built you a house of hab@@ itation , and a place for you to dwell in forever . "
now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
nevertheless you shall not build the house ; but your son who shall come forth out of your body , he shall build the house for my name . '
" Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has performed his word that he spoke ; for I have risen up in the place of David my father , and sit on the throne of Israel , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h promised , and have built the house for the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
he stood before the altar of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in the presence of all the assembly of Israel , and spread forth his hands
who have kept with your servant David my father that which you promised him : yes , you spoke with your mouth , and have fulfilled it with your hand , as it is this day .
" but will God indeed dwell with men on the earth ? behold , heaven and the heaven of heavens can '@@ t contain you ; how much less this house which I have built !
yet have respect for the prayer of your servant , and to his suppl@@ ication , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h my God , to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant pra@@ ys before you ;
that your eyes may be open toward this house day and night , even toward the place where you have said that you would put your name ; to listen to the prayer which your servant shall pray toward this place .
listen to the peti@@ tions of your servant , and of your people Israel , when they shall pray toward this place : yes , hear from your dwelling place , even from heaven ; and when you hear , forgive .
" if a man sin against his neighbor , and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear , and he comes and sw@@ ears before your altar in this house ;
then hear from heaven , and do , and judge your servants , bringing re@@ tribution to the wicked , to bring his way on his own head ; and justi@@ fying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
then hear in heaven , and forgive the sin of your servants , and of your people Israel , when you teach them the good way in which they should walk ; and send rain on your land , which you have given to your people for an inheritance .
then hear from heaven , your dwelling place and forgive , and render to every man according to all his ways , whose heart you know ; ( for you , even you only , know the hearts of the children of men ; )
" moreover concerning the foreigner , who is not of your people Israel , when he shall come from a far country for your great name 's sake , and your mighty hand , and your out@@ stretched arm ; when they shall come and pray toward this house :
" if they sin against you ( for there is no man who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t sin ) , and you are angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away captive to a land far off or near ;
yet if they shall repent themselves in the land where they are carried captive , and turn again , and make suppl@@ ication to you in the land of their cap@@ tivity , saying , ' We have sin@@ ned , we have done per@@ vers@@ ely , and have dealt w@@ ick@@ edly ; '
" now therefore arise , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h God , into your resting place , you , and the ark of your strength : let your priests , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h God , be clo@@ thed with salvation , and let your saints rejoice in goodness .
King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty @@@ -@@ @ two thousand head of cattle , and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep . so the king and all the people dedicated God 's house .
so Solomon held the feast at that time seven days , and all Israel with him , a very great assembly , from the entrance of Ham@@ ath to the bro@@ ok of Egypt .
on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly : for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days , and the feast seven days .
on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents , joyful and glad of heart for the goodness that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had shown to David , and to Solomon , and to Israel his people .
thus Solomon finished the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the king 's house : and he successfully completed all that came into Solomon 's heart to make in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and in his own house .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h appeared to Solomon by night , and said to him , " I have heard your prayer , and have chosen this place to myself for a house of sacrifice .
" if I shut up the sky so that there is no rain , or if I command the loc@@ ust to dev@@ our the land , or if I send pesti@@ l@@ ence among my people ;
if my people , who are called by my name , shall humble themselves , and pray , and seek my face , and turn from their wicked ways ; then will I hear from heaven , and will forgive their sin , and will heal their land .
then I will establish the throne of your kingdom , according as I coven@@ anted with David your father , saying , ' There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel . '
then I will pl@@ uck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have made holy for my name , I will cast out of my sight , and I will make it a prover@@ b and a by@@ word among all peoples .
this house , which is so high , everyone who passes by it shall be astonished , and shall say , ' Why has Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h done thus to this land , and to this house ? '
that the cities which Hur@@ am had given to Solomon , Solomon built them , and caused the children of Israel to dwell there .
also he built B@@ eth Hor@@ on the upper , and B@@ eth Hor@@ on the lower , fortified cities , with walls , gates , and bars ;
and Ba@@ al@@ ath , and all the storage cities that Solomon had , and all the cities for his ch@@ ari@@ ots , and the cities for his hor@@ sem@@ en , and all that Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem , and in Lebanon , and in all the land of his dom@@ inion .
as for all the people who were left of the Hit@@ ti@@ tes , and the A@@ mor@@ ites , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ites , and the Hi@@ v@@ ites , and the Je@@ bus@@ ites , who were not of Israel ;
of their children who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel did@@ n '@@ t consume , of them Solomon con@@ scrip@@ ted forced labor to this day .
but of the children of Israel , Solomon made no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his cap@@ tains , and rulers of his ch@@ ari@@ ots and of his hor@@ sem@@ en .
these were the chief officers of king Solomon , even two @@@ -@@ @ hundred fifty , who ruled over the people .
then Solomon offered burnt offerings to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h on the altar of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he had built before the por@@ ch ,
even as the duty of every day required , offering according to the commandment of Moses , on the Sab@@ baths , and on the new mo@@ ons , and on the set fe@@ asts , three times in the year , in the feast of un@@ leav@@ ened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tents .
they did@@ n '@@ t depart from the commandment of the king to the priests and Lev@@ ites concerning any matter , or concerning the treasures .
Hur@@ am sent him ships and servants who had knowledge of the sea by the hands of his servants ; and they came with the servants of Solomon to O@@ ph@@ ir , and fetched from there four hundred fifty talents of gold , and brought them to king Solomon .
she said to the king , " It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your acts , and of your wisdom .
she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold , and spices in great abundance , and precious stones : neither was there any such sp@@ ice as the queen of She@@ ba gave to king Solomon .
the king made of the al@@ gum trees terraces for the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and for the king 's house , and har@@ ps and str@@ ing@@ ed instruments for the singers : and there were none like these seen before in the land of Jud@@ ah .
besides that which the traders and merchants brought : and all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon .
he made three hundred shi@@ elds of beaten gold ; three hundred she@@ k@@ els of gold went to one shield : and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon .
and there were six steps to the throne , with a foot@@ stool of gold , which were fast@@ ened to the throne , and stays on either side by the place of the seat , and two lions standing beside the stays .
for the king had ships that went to Tar@@ sh@@ ish with the servants of Hur@@ am ; once every three years came the ships of Tar@@ sh@@ ish , bringing gold , and silver , iv@@ ory , and apes , and peac@@ ocks .
it happened , when J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat heard of it , ( for he was in Egypt , where he had fled from the presence of king Solomon ) , that J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am returned out of Egypt .
" your father made our y@@ oke griev@@ ous : now therefore make you the griev@@ ous service of your father , and his heavy y@@ oke which he put on us , lighter , and we will serve you . "
King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am took counsel with the old men , who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , saying , " What counsel do you give me to return answer to this people ? "
they spoke to him , saying , " If you are kind to this people , and please them , and speak good words to them , then they will be your servants forever . "
now whereas my father burdened you with a heavy y@@ oke , I will add to your y@@ oke . my father ch@@ asti@@ sed you with whi@@ ps , but I will ch@@ as@@ tise you with scor@@ pi@@ ons . ' "
so the king did@@ n '@@ t listen to the people ; for it was brought about of God , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h might establish his word , which he spoke by A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite to J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat .
but as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Jud@@ ah , Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am re@@ igned over them .
then king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am sent H@@ ador@@ am , who was over the men subject to forced labor ; and the children of Israel st@@ oned him to death with stones . King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made speed to get himself up to his ch@@ ari@@ ot , to flee to Jerusalem .
when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am had come to Jerusalem , he assembled the house of Jud@@ ah and Benjamin , one hundred eighty thousand chosen men , who were warriors , to fight against Israel , to bring the kingdom again to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am .
" speak to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am the son of Solomon , king of Jud@@ ah , and to all Israel in Jud@@ ah and Benjamin , saying ,
'@@ Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " You shall not go up , nor fight against your brothers ! return every man to his house ; for this thing is of me . " ' " so they listened to the words of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and returned from going against J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am .
for the Lev@@ ites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem : for J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am and his sons cast them off , that they should not execute the priest 's office to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ;
after them , out of all the tribes of Israel , such as set their hearts to seek Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fathers .
Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am loved Ma@@ ac@@ ah the daughter of Ab@@ sal@@ om above all his wives and his conc@@ ub@@ ines : ( for he took eighteen wives , and sixty conc@@ ub@@ ines , and became the father of twenty @@@ -@@ @ eight sons and sixty daughters . )
he dealt wisely , and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Jud@@ ah and Benjamin , to every fortified city : and he gave them food in abundance . he sought for them many wives .
it happened , when the kingdom of Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am was established , and he was strong , that he for@@ s@@ ook the law of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and all Israel with him .
now Sh@@ em@@ aiah the prophet came to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , and to the princes of Jud@@ ah , who were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Sh@@ is@@ hak , and said to them , " Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' You have for@@ s@@ aken me , therefore have I also left you in the hand of Sh@@ is@@ hak . ' "
when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h saw that they hum@@ bled themselves , the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came to Sh@@ em@@ aiah , saying , " They have hum@@ bled themselves . I will not destroy them ; but I will grant them some deliver@@ ance , and my wrath shall not be poured out on Jerusalem by the hand of Sh@@ is@@ hak .
nevertheless they shall be his servants , that they may know my service , and the service of the king@@ doms of the countries . "
King Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made in their place shi@@ elds of brass , and committed them to the hands of the cap@@ tains of the guard , who kept the door of the king 's house .
it was so , that as often as the king entered into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the guard came and bore them , and brought them back into the guard room .
A@@ bi@@ jah joined battle with an army of val@@ i@@ ant men of war , even four hundred thousand chosen men : and J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men , who were mighty men of val@@ or .
ought you not to know that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever , even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt ?
yet J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , the servant of Solomon the son of David , rose up , and reb@@ elled against his lord .
" now you think to withstand the kingdom of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in the hand of the sons of David ; and you are a great multitude , and there are with you the golden cal@@ ves which J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am made you for gods .
" but as for us , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is our God , and we have not for@@ s@@ aken him ; and we have priests minist@@ ering to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the sons of Aaron , and the Lev@@ ites in their work :
behold , God is with us at our head , and his priests with the trum@@ pets of alarm to sound an alarm against you . children of Israel , don '@@ t fight against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fathers ; for you shall not prosper . "
when Jud@@ ah looked back , behold , the battle was before and behind them ; and they cried to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the priests sounded with the trum@@ pets .
thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time , and the children of Jud@@ ah prevailed , because they relied on Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fathers .
but A@@ bi@@ jah grew mighty , and took to himself fourteen wives , and became the father of twenty @@@ -@@ @ two sons , and sixteen daughters .
so A@@ bi@@ jah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city of David ; and As@@ a his son re@@ igned in his place . in his days the land was quiet ten years .
for he took away the foreign al@@ t@@ ars , and the high places , and broke down the pillars , and cut down the Ash@@ eri@@ m ,
and commanded Jud@@ ah to seek Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fathers , and to do the law and the commandment .
also he took away out of all the cities of Jud@@ ah the high places and the sun images : and the kingdom was quiet before him .
AS@@ A had an army that bore buck@@ lers and spe@@ ars , out of Jud@@ ah three hundred thousand ; and out of Benjamin , that bore shi@@ elds and drew b@@ ows , two hundred eighty thousand : all these were mighty men of val@@ or .
there came out against them Zer@@ ah the Ethiopian with an army of a million troops , and three hundred ch@@ ari@@ ots ; and he came to Ma@@ resha@@ h .
he gathered all Jud@@ ah and Benjamin , and those who lived with them out of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and out of Sim@@ eon : for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance , when they saw that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God was with him .
they s@@ wore to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h with a loud voice , and with shouting , and with trum@@ pets , and with cor@@ nets .
in the six and thir@@ ti@@ eth year of the reign of As@@ a , Ba@@ asha king of Israel went up against Jud@@ ah , and built Ram@@ ah , that he might not allow anyone to go out or come in to As@@ a king of Jud@@ ah .
then As@@ a brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h and of the king 's house , and sent to Ben had@@ ad king of Syria , who lived at Damascus , saying ,
" let there be a treaty between me and you , as there was between my father and your father . behold , I have sent you silver and gold . go , break your treaty with Ba@@ asha king of Israel , that he may depart from me . "
Ben had@@ ad listened to king As@@ a , and sent the cap@@ tains of his armies against the cities of Israel ; and they struck I@@ j@@ on , and Dan , and A@@ bel M@@ aim , and all the storage cities of N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i .
it happened , when Ba@@ asha heard of it , that he left off building Ram@@ ah , and let his work cease .
at that time Han@@ ani the se@@ er came to As@@ a king of Jud@@ ah , and said to him , " Because you have relied on the king of Syria , and have not relied on Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , therefore is the army of the king of Syria escaped out of your hand .
then As@@ a was angry with the se@@ er , and put him in the prison ; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing . AS@@ A oppressed some of the people at the same time .
he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Jud@@ ah , and set gar@@ ris@@ ons in the land of Jud@@ ah , and in the cities of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , which As@@ a his father had taken .
his heart was lifted up in the ways of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : and furthermore he took away the high places and the Ash@@ eri@@ m out of Jud@@ ah .
also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes , even Ben H@@ ail , and Ob@@ adi@@ ah , and Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , and N@@ eth@@ an@@ el , and Mic@@ aiah , to teach in the cities of Jud@@ ah ;
they taught in Jud@@ ah , having the book of the law of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h with them ; and they went about throughout all the cities of Jud@@ ah , and taught among the people .
the fear of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h fell on all the king@@ doms of the lands that were around Jud@@ ah , so that they made no war against Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at .
some of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines brought Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at presents , and silver for tribute ; the Arab@@ ians also brought him f@@ locks , seven thousand and seven hundred r@@ ams , and seven thousand and seven hundred male goats .
he had many works in the cities of Jud@@ ah ; and men of war , mighty men of val@@ or , in Jerusalem .
this was the numbering of them according to their fathers ' houses : of Jud@@ ah , the cap@@ tains of thousands : Ad@@ n@@ ah the captain , and with him mighty men of val@@ or three hundred thousand ;
and next to him Ama@@ si@@ ah the son of Z@@ ich@@ ri , who willingly offered himself to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of val@@ or .
these were those who waited on the king , besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Jud@@ ah .
after certain years he went down to A@@ hab to Sam@@ aria . A@@ hab killed sheep and cattle for him in abundance , and for the people who were with him , and moved him to go up with him to Ram@@ o@@ th Gil@@ e@@ ad .
Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at said to the king of Israel , " Please inqu@@ ire first for the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
but Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at said , " is@@ n '@@ t there here a prophet of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h besides , that we may inqu@@ ire of him ? "
now the king of Israel and Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Jud@@ ah sat each on his throne , ar@@ ra@@ yed in their robes , and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Sam@@ aria ; and all the prophets were proph@@ es@@ ying before them .
Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the son of Chen@@ a@@ an@@ ah made him horns of iron , and said , " Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' With these you shall push the Syrians , until they are consumed . ' "
the messenger who went to call Mic@@ aiah spoke to him , saying , " Be@@ hold , the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth . let your word therefore , please be like one of theirs , and speak good . "
when he had come to the king , the king said to him , " Mic@@ aiah , shall we go to Ram@@ o@@ th Gil@@ e@@ ad to battle , or shall I for@@ bear ? " he said , " Go up , and prosper . they shall be delivered into your hand . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , ' Who shall enti@@ ce A@@ hab king of Israel , that he may go up and fall at Ram@@ o@@ th Gil@@ e@@ ad ? ' one spoke saying in this way , and another saying in that way .
" now therefore , behold , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken evil concerning you . "
the king of Israel said , " Take Mic@@ aiah , and carry him back to Am@@ on the governor of the city , and to Jo@@ ash the king 's son ;
and say , ' Th@@ us says the king , " P@@ ut this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of afflic@@ tion and with water of afflic@@ tion , until I return in peace . " ' "
Mic@@ aiah said , " If you return at all in peace , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has not spoken by me . " he said , " List@@ en , you peoples , all of you ! "
the king of Israel said to Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , " I will disguise myself , and go into the battle ; but you put on your robes . " so the king of Israel disguised himself ; and they went into the battle .
it happened , when the cap@@ tains of the ch@@ ari@@ ots saw Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , that they said , " It is the king of Israel ! " therefore they turned around to fight against him . but Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at cried out , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h helped him ; and God moved them to depart from him .
it happened , when the cap@@ tains of the ch@@ ari@@ ots saw that it was not the king of Israel , that they turned back from pursuing him .
Je@@ hu the son of Han@@ ani the se@@ er went out to meet him , and said to king Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , " Should you help the wicked , and love those who hate Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ? because of this , wrath is on you from before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
nevertheless there are good things found in you , in that you have put away the Ash@@ ero@@ th out of the land , and have set your heart to seek God . "
moreover in Jerusalem Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at appointed Lev@@ ites and priests , and of the heads of the fathers ' households of Israel , for the judgment of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and for controversies . they returned to Jerusalem .
then some came who told Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , saying , " A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea from Syria . behold , they are in Haz@@ az@@ on Tam@@ ar " ( that is , E@@ n G@@ ed@@ i ) .
Jud@@ ah gathered themselves together , to seek help from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . they came out of all the cities of Jud@@ ah to seek Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
now , behold , the children of Am@@ mon and Mo@@ ab and Mount Se@@ ir , whom you would not let Israel invade , when they came out of the land of Egypt , but they turned aside from them , and did@@ n '@@ t destroy them ;
and he said , " List@@ en , all Jud@@ ah , and you inhabitants of Jerusalem , and you king Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at . thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to you , ' Don '@@ t be afraid , neither be dis@@ may@@ ed by reason of this great multitude ; for the battle is not yours , but God 's .
tomorrow go down against them . behold , they are coming up by the ascent of Zi@@ z . you shall find them at the end of the valley , before the wilderness of Jer@@ u@@ el .
Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at bowed his head with his face to the ground ; and all Jud@@ ah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , wor@@ shipping Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
when he had taken counsel with the people , he appointed those who should sing to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and give praise in holy array , as they went out before the army , and say , Gi@@ ve thanks to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; for his loving kindness endu@@ res forever .
for the children of Am@@ mon and Mo@@ ab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Se@@ ir , utterly to kill and destroy them : and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Se@@ ir , everyone helped to destroy another .
when Jud@@ ah came to the place overlooking the wilderness , they looked at the multitude ; and behold , they were dead bodies fallen to the earth , and there were none who escaped .
on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Ber@@ ac@@ ah ; for there they blessed Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : therefore the name of that place was called The valley of Ber@@ ac@@ ah to this day .
then they returned , every man of Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem , and Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at in their forefront , to go again to Jerusalem with joy ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had made them to rejoice over their enemies .
Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at re@@ igned over Jud@@ ah : he was thirty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Az@@ ub@@ ah the daughter of Sh@@ il@@ hi .
however the high places were not taken away ; neither as yet had the people set their hearts to the God of their fathers .
he had brothers , the sons of Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at : Az@@ ari@@ ah , and Je@@ hi@@ el , and Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , and Az@@ ari@@ ah , and Michael , and Sh@@ eph@@ ati@@ ah ; all these were the sons of Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at king of Israel .
their father gave them great gifts , of silver , and of gold , and of precious things , with fortified cities in Jud@@ ah : but the kingdom gave he to Je@@ hor@@ am , because he was the fir@@ st@@ born .
he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of A@@ hab ; for he had the daughter of A@@ hab as wife : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
however Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h would not destroy the house of David , because of the covenant that he had made with David , and as he promised to give a lamp to him and to his children always .
then Je@@ hor@@ am passed over with his cap@@ tains , and all his ch@@ ari@@ ots with him : and he rose up by night , and struck the E@@ dom@@ ites who surrounded him , along with the cap@@ tains of the ch@@ ari@@ ots .
moreover he made high places in the mountains of Jud@@ ah , and made the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the pro@@ stitute , and led Jud@@ ah astr@@ ay .
but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel , and have made Jud@@ ah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to play the pro@@ stitute , like the house of A@@ hab did , and also have sl@@ ain your brothers of your father 's house , who were better than yourself :
thirty @@@ -@@ @ two years old was he when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned in Jerusalem eight years : and he departed without being desired ; and they buried him in the city of David , but not in the tom@@ bs of the kings .
the inhabitants of Jerusalem made A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah his youngest son king in his place ; for the band of men who came with the Arab@@ ians to the camp had sl@@ ain all the el@@ dest . so A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ hor@@ am king of Jud@@ ah re@@ igned .
forty @@@ -@@ @ two years old was A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned one year in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Ath@@ ali@@ ah the daughter of Om@@ ri .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , as did the house of A@@ hab ; for they were his counsel@@ ors after the death of his father , to his destruction .
now when Ath@@ ali@@ ah the mother of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah saw that her son was dead , she arose and destroyed all the royal seed of the house of Jud@@ ah .
all the assembly made a covenant with the king in God 's house . he said to them , " Be@@ hold , the king 's son shall reign , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken concerning the sons of David .
but let no one come into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , except the priests , and those who minister of the Lev@@ ites . they shall come in , for they are holy , but all the people shall follow Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's instructions .
he set all the people , every man with his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the house to the left side of the house , along by the altar and the house , around the king .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the priest brought out the cap@@ tains of hundreds who were set over the army , and said to them , " B@@ ring her out between the ranks ; and whoever follows her , let him be sl@@ ain with the sword . " for the priest said , " Don '@@ t kill her in the Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's house . "
so they made way for her . she went to the entrance of the horse gate to the king 's house ; and they killed her there .
all the people went to the house of Ba@@ al , and broke it down , and broke his al@@ t@@ ars and his images in pieces , and killed M@@ attan the priest of Ba@@ al before the al@@ t@@ ars .
he set the porters at the gates of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that no one who was un@@ clean in anything should enter in .
Jo@@ ash was seven years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned forty years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Zi@@ bi@@ ah , of Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba .
Jo@@ ash did that which was right in the eyes of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h all the days of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the priest .
he gathered together the priests and the Lev@@ ites , and said to them , " Go out to the cities of Jud@@ ah , and gather money to repair the house of your God from all Israel from year to year . see that you exped@@ ite this matter . " however the Lev@@ ites did@@ n '@@ t do it right away .
they made a pro@@ clamation through Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem , to bring in for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h the tax that Moses the servant of God laid on Israel in the wilderness .
so the work@@ men worked , and the work of repairing went forward in their hands , and they set up God 's house in its state , and strengthened it .
they con@@ spi@@ red against him , and st@@ oned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
thus Jo@@ ash the king did@@ n '@@ t remember the kindness which Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada his father had done to him , but killed his son . when he died , he said , " May Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h look at it , and repay it . "
for the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h delivered a very great army into their hand , because they had for@@ s@@ aken Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fathers . so they executed judgment on Jo@@ ash .
these are those who con@@ spi@@ red against him : Z@@ abad the son of Shim@@ e@@ ath the Am@@ monit@@ ess , and Je@@ ho@@ z@@ abad the son of Shim@@ rit@@ h the Mo@@ ab@@ it@@ ess .
now it happened , when the kingdom was established to him , that he killed his servants who had killed the king his father .
a man of God came to him , saying , " O king , don '@@ t let the army of Israel go with you ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is not with Israel , with all the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
Ama@@ zi@@ ah took courage , and led forth his people , and went to the Valley of Salt , and struck ten thousand of the children of Se@@ ir .
the children of Jud@@ ah carry away ten thousand alive , and brought them to the top of the rock , and threw them down from the top of the rock , so that they all were broken in pieces .
but the men of the army whom Ama@@ zi@@ ah sent back , that they should not go with him to battle , fell on the cities of Jud@@ ah , from Sam@@ aria even to B@@ eth Hor@@ on , and struck of them three thousand , and took much spoil .
therefore the anger of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was kind@@ led against Ama@@ zi@@ ah , and he sent to him a prophet , who said to him , " Why have you sought after the gods of the people , which have not delivered their own people out of your hand ? "
then Ama@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah consulted his advisers , and sent to Jo@@ ash , the son of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz the son of Je@@ hu , king of Israel , saying , " Come , let us look one another in the face . "
but Ama@@ zi@@ ah would not listen ; for it was of God , that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies , because they had sought after the gods of E@@ dom .
so Jo@@ ash king of Israel went up ; and he and Ama@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah looked one another in the face at B@@ eth Sh@@ em@@ esh , which belongs to Jud@@ ah .
he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in God 's house with O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom , and the treasures of the king 's house , the hostages also , and returned to Sam@@ aria .
sixteen years old was Uz@@ zi@@ ah when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned fifty @@@ -@@ @ two years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was J@@ ech@@ ili@@ ah , of Jerusalem .
he set himself to seek God in the days of Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , who had understanding in the vision of God : and as long as he sought Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , God made him to prosper .
moreover Uz@@ zi@@ ah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate , and at the valley gate , and at the turning of the wall , and fortified them .
he built towers in the wilderness , and dug out many ci@@ ster@@ ns , for he had much livestock ; in the low@@ land also , and in the plain : and he had farmers and viney@@ ard keepers in the mountains and in the fruitful fields ; for he loved farming .
moreover Uz@@ zi@@ ah had an army of fighting men , who went out to war by bands , according to the number of their reckoning made by J@@ ei@@ el the scri@@ be and Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah the officer , under the hand of Han@@ ani@@ ah , one of the king 's cap@@ tains .
under their hand was an army , three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred , who made war with mighty power , to help the king against the enemy .
Uz@@ zi@@ ah prepared for them , even for all the army , shi@@ elds , and spe@@ ars , and hel@@ mets , and coats of mail , and b@@ ows , and stones for sl@@ inging .
he made in Jerusalem engines , invented by skillful men , to be on the towers and on the batt@@ l@@ ements , with which to shoot arrows and great stones . his name spread far abroad ; for he was marvel@@ ously helped , until he was strong .
but when he was strong , his heart was lifted up , so that he did corrup@@ tly , and he t@@ resp@@ assed against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God ; for he went into Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's temple to burn inc@@ ense on the altar of inc@@ ense .
then Uz@@ zi@@ ah was angry ; and he had a cen@@ ser in his hand to burn inc@@ ense ; and while he was angry with the priests , the le@@ pro@@ sy broke forth in his forehead before the priests in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , beside the altar of inc@@ ense .
Uz@@ zi@@ ah the king was a le@@ per to the day of his death , and lived in a separate house , being a le@@ per ; for he was cut off from the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : and Jo@@ th@@ am his son was over the king 's house , judging the people of the land .
now the rest of the acts of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , first and last , Isaiah the prophet , the son of A@@ mo@@ z , wrote .
so Uz@@ zi@@ ah slept with his fathers ; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings ; for they said , " He is a le@@ per . " Jo@@ th@@ am his son re@@ igned in his place .
Jo@@ th@@ am was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Jerus@@ ha@@ h the daughter of Z@@ ad@@ ok .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , according to all that his father Uz@@ zi@@ ah had done : however he did@@ n '@@ t enter into Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's temple . the people still did corrup@@ tly .
moreover he built cities in the hill country of Jud@@ ah , and in the forests he built castles and towers .
A@@ haz was twenty years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned sixteen years in Jerusalem : and he did@@ n '@@ t do that which was right in the eyes of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , like David his father ;
moreover he burnt inc@@ ense in the valley of the son of H@@ inno@@ m , and burnt his children in the fire , according to the ab@@ om@@ inations of the nations whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h cast out before the children of Israel .
for Pe@@ k@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah killed in Jud@@ ah one hundred twenty thousand in one day , all of them val@@ i@@ ant men ; because they had for@@ s@@ aken Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fathers .
now you purpose to keep under the children of Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem for bond@@ servants and bond@@ m@@ aids for yourselves . are@@ n '@@ t there even with you t@@ resp@@ asses of your own against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God ?
now hear me therefore , and send back the cap@@ tives , that you have taken captive from your brothers ; for the fierce wrath of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is on you . "
then some of the heads of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , Az@@ ari@@ ah the son of Johan@@ an , Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah the son of M@@ esh@@ ill@@ emo@@ th , and Je@@ hi@@ z@@ ki@@ ah the son of Sh@@ all@@ um , and A@@ mas@@ a the son of Had@@ la@@ i , stood up against those who came from the war ,
A@@ haz gathered together the vessels of God 's house , and cut in pieces the vessels of God 's house , and shut up the doors of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and he made him al@@ t@@ ars in every corner of Jerusalem .
in every city of Jud@@ ah he made high places to burn inc@@ ense to other gods , and provoked to anger Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of his fathers .
A@@ haz slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jerusalem ; for they did@@ n '@@ t bring him into the tom@@ bs of the kings of Israel : and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah his son re@@ igned in his place .
he in the first year of his reign , in the first month , opened the doors of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and repaired them .
he brought in the priests and the Lev@@ ites , and gathered them together into the broad place on the east ,
for our fathers have t@@ resp@@ assed , and done that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God , and have for@@ s@@ aken him , and have turned away their faces from the hab@@ itation of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and turned their backs .
therefore the wrath of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was on Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem , and he has delivered them to be tos@@ sed back and forth , to be an aston@@ ishment , and a his@@ sing , as you see with your eyes .
now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , that his fierce anger may turn away from us .
my sons , don '@@ t be neg@@ lig@@ ent now ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has chosen you to stand before him , to minister to him , and that you should be his ministers , and burn inc@@ ense . "
the priests went in to the inner part of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to clean@@ se it , and brought out all the un@@ clean@@ ness that they found in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's temple into the court of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . the Lev@@ ites took it , to carry it out abroad to the bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
then they went in to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah the king within the palace , and said , " We have cleans@@ ed all the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the altar of burnt offering , with all its vessels , and the table of show bread , with all its vessels .
moreover all the vessels , which king A@@ haz in his reign threw away when he t@@ resp@@ assed , have we prepared and sancti@@ fied ; and behold , they are before the altar of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
then He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah the king arose early , and gathered the princes of the city , and went up to the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
they brought seven bul@@ ls , and seven r@@ ams , and seven lam@@ bs , and seven male goats , for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Jud@@ ah . he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
he set the Lev@@ ites in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h with cy@@ mb@@ als , with str@@ ing@@ ed instruments , and with har@@ ps , according to the commandment of David , and of G@@ ad the king 's se@@ er , and Na@@ than the prophet ; for the commandment was of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h by his prophets .
He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah commanded to offer the burnt offering on the altar . when the burnt offering began , the song of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h began also , and the trum@@ pets , together with the instruments of David king of Israel .
all the assembly worshi@@ ped , and the singers sang , and the trum@@ pet@@ ers sounded ; all this continued until the burnt offering was finished .
moreover He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah the king and the princes commanded the Lev@@ ites to sing pra@@ ises to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h with the words of David , and of As@@ ap@@ h the se@@ er . they sang pra@@ ises with gl@@ ad@@ ness , and they bowed their heads and worshi@@ ped .
the number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bul@@ ls , one hundred r@@ ams , and two hundred lam@@ bs : all these were for a burnt offering to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah rejo@@ iced , and all the people , because of that which God had prepared for the people : for the thing was done suddenly .
for the king had taken counsel , and his princes , and all the assembly in Jerusalem , to keep the Pas@@ sover in the second month .
for they could not keep it at that time , because the priests had not sancti@@ fied themselves in sufficient number , neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem .
now don '@@ t be stiff @@@ -@@ @ nec@@ ked , as your fathers were ; but yield yourselves to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and enter into his sanctuary , which he has sancti@@ fied forever , and serve Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , that his fierce anger may turn away from you .
so the cou@@ ri@@ ers passed from city to city through the country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , even to Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n : but they ridicul@@ ed them , and mo@@ cked them .
also on Jud@@ ah came the hand of God to give them one heart , to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
they stood in their place after their order , according to the law of Moses the man of God : the priests sprink@@ led the blood which they received of the hand of the Lev@@ ites .
for there were many in the assembly who had not sancti@@ fied themselves : therefore the Lev@@ ites were in charge of killing the Pas@@ so@@ vers for everyone who was not clean , to sancti@@ fy them to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
the children of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of un@@ leav@@ ened bread seven days with great gl@@ ad@@ ness ; and the Lev@@ ites and the priests praised Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h day by day , singing with loud instruments to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah spoke comfortably to all the Lev@@ ites who had good understanding in the service of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . so they ate throughout the feast for the seven days , offering sacrifices of peace offerings , and making confession to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fathers .
for He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah gave to the assembly for offerings one thousand bul@@ ls and seven thousand sheep ; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bul@@ ls and ten thousand sheep : and a great number of priests sancti@@ fied themselves .
all the assembly of Jud@@ ah , with the priests and the Lev@@ ites , and all the assembly who came out of Israel , and the foreigners who came out of the land of Israel , and who lived in Jud@@ ah , rejo@@ iced .
moreover he commanded the people who lived in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Lev@@ ites , that they might give themselves to the law of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
the children of Israel and Jud@@ ah , who lived in the cities of Jud@@ ah , they also brought in the ti@@ the of cattle and sheep , and the ti@@ the of dedicated things which were consec@@ rated to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God , and laid them by he@@ aps .
K@@ ore the son of Im@@ n@@ ah the Lev@@ ite , the porter at the east gate , was over the fre@@ e@@ will offerings of God , to distribute the offerings of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the most holy things .
besides those who were reck@@ oned by gen@@ eal@@ ogy of males , from three years old and upward , even everyone who entered into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , as the duty of every day required , for their service in their offices according to their divisions ;
and those who were reck@@ oned by gen@@ eal@@ ogy of the priests by their fathers ' houses , and the Lev@@ ites from twenty years old and upward , in their offices by their divisions ;
in every work that he began in the service of God 's house , and in the law , and in the commandments , to seek his God , he did it with all his heart , and prosper@@ ed .
after these things , and this faith@@ fulness , Sen@@ n@@ ach@@ eri@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ria came , and entered into Jud@@ ah , and enc@@ amped against the fortified cities , and thought to win them for himself .
he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the springs which were outside of the city ; and they helped him .
so many people gathered together , and they stopped all the springs , and the bro@@ ok that flowed through the midst of the land , saying , " Why should the kings of As@@ sy@@ ria come , and find much water ? "
he took courage , and built up all the wall that was broken down , and raised it up to the towers , and the other wall outside , and strengthened Mill@@ o in the city of David , and made weapons and shi@@ elds in abundance .
he set cap@@ tains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the broad place at the gate of the city , and spoke comfortably to them , saying ,
with him is an arm of flesh ; but with us is Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God to help us , and to fight our battles . " the people rested themselves on the words of He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah .
do@@ es@@ n '@@ t He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah persuade you , to give you over to die by famine and by thirst , saying , ' Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria ? '
h@@ as@@ n '@@ t the same He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah taken away his high places and his al@@ t@@ ars , and commanded Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem , saying , ' You shall worship before one altar , and on it you shall burn inc@@ ense ? '
Don '@@ t you know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands ? were the gods of the nations of the lands in any way able to deliver their land out of my hand ?
who was there among all the gods of those nations which my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of my hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand ?
they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall , to fri@@ ghten them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah the king , and Isaiah the prophet the son of A@@ mo@@ z , prayed because of this , and cried to heaven .
thus Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h saved He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sen@@ n@@ ach@@ eri@@ b the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , and from the hand of all others , and guided them on every side .
many brought gifts to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to Jerusalem , and precious things to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah ; so that he was exalted in the sight of all nations from th@@ ence@@ forth .
in those days He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah was sick even to death : and he prayed to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and he spoke to him , and gave him a sign .
but He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah did@@ n '@@ t render again according to the benefit done to him ; for his heart was lifted up : therefore there was wrath on him , and on Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem .
notwithstanding He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah hum@@ bled himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h did@@ n '@@ t come on them in the days of He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah .
this same He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah also stopped the upper spring of the waters of Gi@@ hon , and brought them straight down on the west side of the city of David . He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah prosper@@ ed in all his works .
however concerning the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon , who sent to him to inqu@@ ire of the wonder that was done in the land , God left him , to try him , that he might know all that was in his heart .
He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the ascent of the tom@@ bs of the sons of David : and all Jud@@ ah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death . Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his son re@@ igned in his place .
he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , after the ab@@ om@@ inations of the nations whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h cast out before the children of Israel .
for he built again the high places which He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah his father had broken down ; and he re@@ ared up al@@ t@@ ars for the Ba@@ als , and made Ash@@ ero@@ th , and worshi@@ ped all the army of the sky , and served them .
neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers , if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them , even all the law and the statutes and the ordin@@ ances given by Moses . "
therefore Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h brought on them the cap@@ tains of the army of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , who took Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in chains , and bound him with fet@@ ters , and carried him to Babylon .
he built up the altar of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and offered there@@ on sacrifices of peace offerings and of thank@@ s@@ giving , and commanded Jud@@ ah to serve Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
but the people of the land killed all those who had con@@ spi@@ red against king Am@@ on ; and the people of the land made Jo@@ si@@ ah his son king in his place .
he did that which was right in the eyes of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and walked in the ways of David his father , and did@@ n '@@ t turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
for in the eighth year of his reign , while he was yet young , he began to seek after the God of David his father ; and in the twel@@ fth year he began to purge Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem from the high places , and the Ash@@ eri@@ m , and the engra@@ ved images , and the mol@@ ten images .
he broke down the al@@ t@@ ars , and beat the Ash@@ eri@@ m and the engra@@ ved images into powder , and cut down all the inc@@ ense al@@ t@@ ars throughout all the land of Israel , and returned to Jerusalem .
now in the eighteenth year of his reign , when he had pur@@ ged the land and the house , he sent Sha@@ ph@@ an the son of Az@@ ali@@ ah , and Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah the governor of the city , and Jo@@ ah the son of Jo@@ a@@ haz the recorder , to repair the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God .
they delivered it into the hand of the work@@ men who had the oversight of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and the work@@ men who lab@@ ored in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h gave it to m@@ end and repair the house ;
also they were over the bearers of burdens , and set forward all who did the work in every kind of service : and of the Lev@@ ites there were scri@@ bes , and officers , and porters .
when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , Hil@@ ki@@ ah the priest found the book of the law of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h given by Moses .
Hil@@ ki@@ ah answered Sha@@ ph@@ an the scri@@ be , " I have found the book of the law in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . " Hil@@ ki@@ ah delivered the book to Sha@@ ph@@ an .
Sha@@ ph@@ an carried the book to the king , and moreover brought back word to the king , saying , " All that was committed to your servants , they are doing .
so Hil@@ ki@@ ah , and they whom the king had commanded , went to H@@ ul@@ d@@ ah the proph@@ et@@ ess , the wife of Sh@@ all@@ um the son of Tok@@ hath , the son of Has@@ rah , keeper of the wardrobe ; ( now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter ; ) and they spoke to her to that effect .
" thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' Be@@ hold , I will bring evil on this place , and on its inhabitants , even all the cur@@ ses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Jud@@ ah .
prepare yourselves after your fathers ' houses by your divisions , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
his princes gave for a fre@@ e@@ will offering to the people , to the priests , and to the Lev@@ ites . Hil@@ ki@@ ah and Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah and Je@@ hi@@ el , the rulers of God 's house , gave to the priests for the Pas@@ sover offerings two thousand and six hundred small livestock , and three hundred head of cattle .
so the service was prepared , and the priests stood in their place , and the Lev@@ ites by their divisions , according to the king 's commandment .
they removed the burnt offerings , that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers ' houses of the children of the people , to offer to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , as it is written in the book of Moses . so they did with the cattle .
they ro@@ asted the Pas@@ sover with fire according to the ordin@@ ance : and the holy offerings boiled they in pots , and in cal@@ dr@@ ons , and in p@@ ans , and carried them quickly to all the children of the people .
afterward they prepared for themselves , and for the priests , because the priests the sons of Aaron were busy with offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night : therefore the Lev@@ ites prepared for themselves , and for the priests the sons of Aaron .
so all the service of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was prepared the same day , to keep the Pas@@ sover , and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , according to the commandment of king Jo@@ si@@ ah .
and his acts , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Jud@@ ah .
the king of Egypt de@@ posed him at Jerusalem , and fined the land one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im was twenty @@@ -@@ @ five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned eleven years in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , and his ab@@ om@@ inations which he did , and that which was found in him , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Jud@@ ah : and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in his son re@@ igned in his place .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in was eight years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned three months and ten days in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
at the return of the year king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar sent , and brought him to Babylon , with the goo@@ dly vessels of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and made Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah his brother king over Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God ; he did@@ n '@@ t humble himself before Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet speaking from the mouth of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
moreover all the chiefs of the priests , and the people , t@@ resp@@ assed very greatly after all the ab@@ om@@ inations of the nations ; and they polluted the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h which he had made holy in Jerusalem .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of their fathers , sent to them by his messengers , rising up early and sending , because he had compassion on his people , and on his dwelling place :
all the vessels of God 's house , great and small , and the treasures of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the treasures of the king , and of his princes , all these he brought to Babylon .
they burnt God 's house , and broke down the wall of Jerusalem , and burnt all its palaces with fire , and destroyed all the goo@@ dly vessels of it .
he carried those who had escaped from the sword away to Babylon ; and they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia :
" thus says Cy@@ rus king of Persia , ' Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of heaven , has given me all the king@@ doms of the earth ; and he has commanded me to build him a house in Jerusalem , which is in Jud@@ ah .
then the heads of fathers ' households of Jud@@ ah and Benjamin , and the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , even all whose spirit God had stirred to go up rose up to build the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h which is in Jerusalem .
all those who were around them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with animals , and with precious things , besides all that was willingly offered .
even those , Cy@@ rus king of Persia brought out by the hand of Mi@@ thre@@ dat@@ h the treas@@ u@@ rer , and numbered them to Sh@@ esh@@ b@@ azz@@ ar , the prince of Jud@@ ah .
all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred . Sh@@ esh@@ b@@ azz@@ ar brought all these up , when the cap@@ tives were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem .
who came with Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el , Jes@@ hua , Ne@@ h@@ emi@@ ah , Ser@@ aiah , Re@@ el@@ aiah , Mor@@ dec@@ ai , Bil@@ shan , Mis@@ par , B@@ ig@@ v@@ ai , Re@@ h@@ um , Ba@@ an@@ ah . the number of the men of the people of Israel :
the Lev@@ ites : the children of Jes@@ hua and Kad@@ mi@@ el , of the children of H@@ od@@ avi@@ ah , seventy @@@ -@@ @ four .
the children of Sh@@ eph@@ ati@@ ah , the children of Hat@@ til , the children of Po@@ cher@@ eth Haz@@ ze@@ bai@@ m , the children of Am@@ i .
the governor said to them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , until there stood up a priest with Uri@@ m and with T@@ hum@@ mi@@ m .
besides their male servants and their female servants , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ seven : and they had two hundred singing men and singing women .
their cam@@ els , four hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ five ; their don@@ keys , six thousand seven hundred and twenty .
some of the heads of fathers ' households , when they came to the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h which is in Jerusalem , offered willingly for God 's house to set it up in its place :
they gave after their ability into the treasury of the work sixty @@@ -@@ @ one thousand dar@@ ics of gold , and five thousand Min@@ as of silver , and one hundred priests ' garments .
so the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , and some of the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the Ne@@ thin@@ im , lived in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
then Jes@@ hua the son of Jo@@ z@@ ad@@ ak stood up with his brothers the priests , and Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el the son of S@@ heal@@ ti@@ el and his brothers , and built the altar of the God of Israel , to offer burnt offerings there@@ on , as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God .
in spite of their fear because of the peoples of the surrounding lands , they set the altar on its base ; and they offered burnt offerings on it to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , even burnt offerings morning and evening .
and afterward the continual burnt offering , the offerings of the new mo@@ ons , of all the set fe@@ asts of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h that were consec@@ rated , and of everyone who willingly offered a fre@@ e@@ will offering to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
from the first day of the seventh month , they began to offer burnt offerings to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; but the foundation of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's temple was not yet laid .
when the builders laid the foundation of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's temple , they set the priests in their clothing with trum@@ pets , with the Lev@@ ites the sons of As@@ ap@@ h with cy@@ mb@@ als , to praise Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , according to the directions of David king of Israel .
but many of the priests and Lev@@ ites and heads of fathers ' households , the old men who had seen the first house , when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , we@@ pt with a loud voice . many also shouted aloud for joy ,
then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Jud@@ ah , and troubled them in building ,
then Re@@ h@@ um the chancellor , and Shim@@ sha@@ i the scri@@ be , and the rest of their companions , the Din@@ a@@ ites , and the A@@ ph@@ ar@@ s@@ ath@@ ch@@ ites , the Tar@@ pel@@ ites , the A@@ ph@@ ar@@ sites , the Arch@@ ev@@ ites , the Bab@@ yl@@ onians , the Sh@@ us@@ han@@ ch@@ ites , the De@@ ha@@ ites , the E@@ lam@@ ites ,
be it known to the king , that the Jews who came up from you have come to us to Jerusalem ; they are building the rebelli@@ ous and the bad city , and have finished the walls , and repaired the foundations .
be it known now to the king that if this city is built , and the walls finished , they will not pay tribute , custom , or toll , and in the end it will be hur@@ tful to the kings .
now because we eat the salt of the palace , and it is not appropriate for us to see the king 's dis@@ honor , therefore have we sent and informed the king ;
then when the copy of king Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ xes ' letter was read before Re@@ h@@ um , and Shim@@ sha@@ i the scri@@ be , and their companions , they went in ha@@ ste to Jerusalem to the Jews , and made them to cease by force and power .
now the prophets , H@@ agg@@ ai the prophet , and Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah the son of Id@@ do , prophe@@ si@@ ed to the Jews who were in Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem ; in the name of the God of Israel they prophe@@ si@@ ed to them .
then rose up Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el the son of S@@ heal@@ ti@@ el , and Jes@@ hua the son of Jo@@ z@@ ad@@ ak , and began to build God 's house which is at Jerusalem ; and with them were the prophets of God , helping them .
at the same time came to them T@@ atten@@ ai , the governor beyond the River , and She@@ th@@ ar@@ bo@@ zen@@ ai , and their companions , and said thus to them , " Who gave you a decree to build this house , and to finish this wall ? "
but the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews , and they did not make them cease , until the matter should come to D@@ arius , and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it .
the copy of the letter that T@@ atten@@ ai , the governor beyond the River , and She@@ th@@ ar@@ bo@@ zen@@ ai , and his companions the A@@ ph@@ ar@@ s@@ ach@@ ites , who were beyond the River , sent to D@@ arius the king ;
then we asked those elders , and said to them thus , " Who gave you a decree to build this house , and to finish this wall ? "
but after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath , he gave them into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon , the Chal@@ dean , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Babylon .
but in the first year of Cy@@ rus king of Babylon , Cy@@ rus the king made a decree to build this house of God .
and he said to him , ' Take these vessels , go , put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem , and let God 's house be built in its place . '
with three courses of great stones , and a course of new timber : and let the expenses be given out of the king 's house .
now therefore , T@@ atten@@ ai , governor beyond the River , She@@ th@@ ar@@ bo@@ zen@@ ai , and your companions the A@@ ph@@ ar@@ s@@ ach@@ ites , who are beyond the River , you must stay far from there .
leave the work of this house of God alone ; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in its place .
the elders of the Jews built and prosper@@ ed , through the proph@@ es@@ ying of H@@ agg@@ ai the prophet and Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah the son of Id@@ do . they built and finished it , according to the commandment of the God of Israel , and according to the decree of Cy@@ rus , and D@@ arius , and Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ xes king of Persia .
the children of Israel , the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , and the rest of the children of the cap@@ tivity , kept the dedication of this house of God with joy .
they offered at the dedication of this house of God one hundred bul@@ ls , two hundred r@@ ams , four hundred lam@@ bs ; and for a sin offering for all Israel , twelve male goats , according to the number of the tribes of Israel .
they set the priests in their divisions , and the Lev@@ ites in their courses , for the service of God , which is at Jerusalem ; as it is written in the book of Moses .
and kept the feast of un@@ leav@@ ened bread seven days with joy : for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had made them joyful , and had turned the heart of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria to them , to strengthen their hands in the work of God 's house , the God of Israel .
now after these things , in the reign of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ xes king of Persia , E@@ z@@ ra the son of Ser@@ aiah , the son of Az@@ ari@@ ah , the son of Hil@@ ki@@ ah ,
this E@@ z@@ ra went up from Babylon : and he was a ready scri@@ be in the law of Moses , which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , had given ; and the king granted him all his request , according to the hand of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God on him .
there went up some of the children of Israel , and of the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , and the singers , and the porters , and the Ne@@ thin@@ im , to Jerusalem , in the seventh year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ xes the king .
for on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon ; and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem , according to the good hand of his God on him .
I make a decree , that all those of the people of Israel , and their priests and the Lev@@ ites , in my realm , who are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem , go with you .
because you are sent of the king and his seven counsel@@ ors , to inqu@@ ire concerning Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem , according to the law of your God which is in your hand ,
and to carry the silver and gold , which the king and his counsel@@ ors have freely offered to the God of Israel , whose hab@@ itation is in Jerusalem ,
and all the silver and gold that you shall find in all the province of Babylon , with the fre@@ e@@ will offering of the people , and of the priests , offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem ;
therefore you shall with all diligence buy with this money bul@@ ls , r@@ ams , lam@@ bs , with their meal offerings and their drink offerings , and shall offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem .
whatever shall seem good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold , do that after the will of your God .
the vessels that are given to you for the service of the house of your God , deliver before the God of Jerusalem .
whatever is commanded by the God of heaven , let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven ; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons ?
also we inform you , that touching any of the priests and Lev@@ ites , the singers , porters , Ne@@ thin@@ im , or servants of this house of God , it shall not be lawful to impose tribute , custom , or toll , on them .
whoever will not do the law of your God , and the law of the king , let judgment be executed on him with all diligence , whether it be to death , or to ban@@ ishment , or to confisc@@ ation of goods , or to imprisonment .
of the sons of Sh@@ ec@@ ani@@ ah , of the sons of Par@@ osh , Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah ; and with him were reck@@ oned by gen@@ eal@@ ogy of the males one hundred fifty .
of the sons of Ad@@ on@@ ik@@ am , who were the last ; and these are their names : Eli@@ ph@@ elet , J@@ eu@@ el , and Sh@@ em@@ aiah ; and with them sixty males .
then sent I for Eli@@ ez@@ er , for Ari@@ el , for Sh@@ em@@ aiah , and for El@@ na@@ than , and for J@@ ari@@ b , and for El@@ na@@ than , and for Na@@ than , and for Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , and for M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lam , chief men ; also for Jo@@ i@@ ari@@ b , and for El@@ na@@ than , who were teachers .
I sent them forth to Id@@ do the chief at the place C@@ asi@@ phia ; and I told them what they should tell Id@@ do , and his brothers the Ne@@ thin@@ im , at the place C@@ asi@@ phia , that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God .
and of the Ne@@ thin@@ im , whom David and the princes had given for the service of the Lev@@ ites , two hundred and twenty Ne@@ thin@@ im : all of them were mentioned by name .
then I proclaimed a fast there , at the river A@@ ha@@ va , that we might humble ourselves before our God , to seek of him a straight way for us , and for our little ones , and for all our substance .
and weighed to them the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , even the offering for the house of our God , which the king , and his counsel@@ ors , and his princes , and all Israel there present , had offered :
I said to them , " You are holy to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the vessels are holy ; and the silver and the gold are a fre@@ e@@ will offering to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fathers .
so the priests and the Lev@@ ites received the weight of the silver and the gold , and the vessels , to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God .
then we departed from the river A@@ ha@@ va on the twel@@ fth day of the first month , to go to Jerusalem : and the hand of our God was on us , and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and the band@@ it by the way .
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons , so that the holy seed have mixed themselves with the peoples of the lands . yes , the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this t@@ resp@@ ass . "
when I heard this thing , I t@@ ore my garment and my robe , and pl@@ ucked off the hair of my head and of my beard , and sat down conf@@ ounded .
then were assembled to me everyone who trem@@ bled at the words of the God of Israel , because of their t@@ resp@@ ass of the cap@@ tivity ; and I sat conf@@ ounded until the evening offering .
at the evening offering I arose up from my humiliation , even with my garment and my robe torn ; and I fell on my knees , and spread out my hands to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h my God ;
and I said , " My God , I am ashamed and bl@@ ush to lift up my face to you , my God ; for our ini@@ qu@@ ities have increased over our head , and our guil@@ t@@ iness has grown up to the heavens .
shall we again break your commandments , and join in aff@@ inity with the peoples that do these ab@@ om@@ inations ? w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t you be angry with us until you had consumed us , so that there should be no remn@@ ant , nor any to escape ?
Sh@@ ec@@ ani@@ ah the son of Je@@ hi@@ el , one of the sons of EL@@ AM , answered E@@ z@@ ra , " We have t@@ resp@@ assed against our God , and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land . yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing .
arise ; for the matter belongs to you , and we are with you . be courageous , and do it . "
then E@@ z@@ ra arose , and made the chiefs of the priests , the Lev@@ ites , and all Israel , to swear that they would do according to this word . so they s@@ wore .
they made pro@@ clamation throughout Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem to all the children of the cap@@ tivity , that they should gather themselves together to Jerusalem ;
and that whoever did@@ n '@@ t come within three days , according to the counsel of the princes and the elders , all his substance should be forfe@@ ited , and himself separated from the assembly of the cap@@ tivity .
E@@ z@@ ra the priest stood up , and said to them , " You have t@@ resp@@ assed , and have married foreign women , to increase the guilt of Israel .
now therefore make confession to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of your fathers , and do his pleasure ; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land , and from the foreign women . "
among the sons of the priests there were found who had married foreign women : of the sons of Jes@@ hua , the son of Jo@@ z@@ ad@@ ak , and his brothers , Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah , and Eli@@ ez@@ er , and J@@ ari@@ b , and G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah .
of Israel : of the sons of Par@@ osh : Ram@@ i@@ ah , and I@@ zz@@ i@@ ah , and Mal@@ chi@@ jah , and Mi@@ j@@ amin , and Ele@@ az@@ ar , and Mal@@ chi@@ jah , and Ben@@ aiah .
the words of Ne@@ h@@ emi@@ ah the son of H@@ ac@@ ali@@ ah . now it happened in the month Ch@@ is@@ le@@ v , in the twentieth year , as I was in Sh@@ ush@@ an the palace ,
that Han@@ ani , one of my brothers , came , he and certain men out of Jud@@ ah ; and I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped , who were left of the cap@@ tivity , and concerning Jerusalem .
they said to me , " The remn@@ ant who are left of the cap@@ tivity there in the province are in great afflic@@ tion and repro@@ ach . the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down , and its gates are burned with fire . "
it happened , when I heard these words , that I sat down and we@@ pt , and mour@@ ned certain days ; and I fast@@ ed and prayed before the God of heaven ,
we have dealt very corrup@@ tly against you , and have not kept the commandments , nor the statutes , nor the ordin@@ ances , which you commanded your servant Moses .
" remember , I beg you , the word that you commanded your servant Moses , saying , ' If you t@@ resp@@ ass , I will sc@@ atter you abroad among the peoples ;
" now these are your servants and your people , whom you have re@@ deemed by your great power , and by your strong hand .
it happened in the month N@@ is@@ an , in the twentieth year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ xes the king , when wine was before him , that I took up the wine , and gave it to the king . now I had not been sad before in his presence .
the king said to me , " Why is your face sad , since you are not sick ? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart . " then I was very much afraid .
I said to the king , " Let the king live forever ! why shoul@@ d@@ n '@@ t my face be sad , when the city , the place of my fathers ' tom@@ bs , lies waste , and its gates have been consumed with fire ? "
I said to the king , " If it pleas@@ es the king , and if your servant has found favor in your sight , that you would send me to Jud@@ ah , to the city of my fathers ' tom@@ bs , that I may build it . "
the king said to me ( the queen was also sitting by him ) , " For how long shall your journey be ? and when will you return ? " so it pleased the king to send me ; and I set him a time .
moreover I said to the king , " If it pleas@@ es the king , let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River , that they may let me pass through until I come to Jud@@ ah ;
then I came to the governors beyond the River , and gave them the king 's letters . now the king had sent with me cap@@ tains of the army and hor@@ sem@@ en .
when San@@ ball@@ at the Hor@@ on@@ ite , and Tob@@ i@@ ah the servant , the Am@@ mon@@ ite , heard of it , it griev@@ ed them exceedingly , because a man had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
then I went on to the spring gate and to the king 's pool : but there was no place for the animal that was under me to pass .
the rulers did@@ n '@@ t know where I went , or what I did ; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews , nor to the priests , nor to the no@@ bles , nor to the rulers , nor to the rest who did the work .
then I said to them , " You see the evil case that we are in , how Jerusalem lies waste , and its gates are burned with fire . come , let us build up the wall of Jerusalem , that we won '@@ t be dis@@ grac@@ ed . "
I told them of the hand of my God which was good on me , as also of the king 's words that he had spoken to me . they said , " Let 's rise up and build . " so they strengthened their hands for the good work .
then answered I them , and said to them , " The God of heaven will prosper us . therefore we , his servants , will arise and build ; but you have no portion , nor right , nor memorial , in Jerusalem . "
then Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the high priest rose up with his brothers the priests , and they built the sheep gate ; they sancti@@ fied it , and set up its doors ; even to the tower of Ham@@ me@@ ah they sancti@@ fied it , to the tower of Han@@ an@@ el .
the sons of Hass@@ en@@ a@@ ah built the fish gate . they laid its beams , and set up its doors , its bol@@ ts , and its bars .
next to them , Mer@@ emo@@ th the son of Uri@@ ah , the son of Hak@@ ko@@ z made repairs . next to them , M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lam the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ he@@ z@@ ab@@ el made repairs . next to them , Z@@ ad@@ ok the son of Ba@@ ana made repairs .
next to them , the Te@@ ko@@ ites made repairs ; but their no@@ bles did@@ n '@@ t put their nec@@ ks to the work of their lord .
Jo@@ i@@ ada the son of Pas@@ e@@ ah and M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lam the son of Bes@@ o@@ de@@ i@@ ah repaired the old gate . they laid its beams , and set up its doors , and its bol@@ ts , and its bars .
next to him , Uz@@ zi@@ el the son of Har@@ ha@@ i@@ ah , g@@ old@@ s@@ mi@@ ths , made repairs . next to him , Han@@ ani@@ ah one of the perf@@ um@@ ers made repairs , and they fortified Jerusalem even to the broad wall .
next to them , J@@ ed@@ aiah the son of Har@@ um@@ ap@@ h made repairs across from his house . next to him , H@@ att@@ ush the son of H@@ ash@@ ab@@ nei@@ ah made repairs .
H@@ anu@@ n and the inhabitants of Z@@ ano@@ ah repaired the valley gate . they built it , and set up its doors , its bol@@ ts , and its bars , and one thousand cub@@ its of the wall to the d@@ ung gate .
Mal@@ chi@@ jah the son of Rec@@ hab , the ruler of the district of B@@ eth H@@ ac@@ cher@@ em repaired the d@@ ung gate . he built it , and set up its doors , its bol@@ ts , and its bars .
next to him , E@@ zer the son of Jes@@ hua , the ruler of M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h , repaired another portion , across from the ascent to the arm@@ ory at the turning of the wall .
after him , Bar@@ uch the son of Zab@@ bai ear@@ ne@@ stly repaired another portion , from the turning of the wall to the door of the house of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the high priest .
after him , Mer@@ emo@@ th the son of Uri@@ ah the son of Hak@@ ko@@ z repaired another portion , from the door of the house of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b even to the end of the house of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b .
after them , Benjamin and Has@@ shu@@ b made repairs across from their house . after them , Az@@ ari@@ ah the son of Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah the son of An@@ ani@@ ah made repairs beside his own house .
after him , Bin@@ nu@@ i the son of Hen@@ ad@@ ad repaired another portion , from the house of Az@@ ari@@ ah to the turning of the wall , and to the corner .
( now the Ne@@ thin@@ im lived in O@@ ph@@ el , to the place over against the water gate toward the east , and the tower that stands out . )
after them , Z@@ ad@@ ok the son of Im@@ mer made repairs across from his own house . after him , Sh@@ em@@ aiah the son of Sh@@ ec@@ ani@@ ah , the keeper of the east gate made repairs .
now Tob@@ i@@ ah the Am@@ mon@@ ite was by him , and he said , " What they are building , if a fox climbed up it , he would break down their stone wall . "
" hear , our God ; for we are desp@@ ised ; and turn back their repro@@ ach on their own head , give them up for a spoil in a land of cap@@ tivity ;
Don '@@ t cover their ini@@ qu@@ ity , and don '@@ t let their sin be blo@@ tted out from before you ; for they have insul@@ ted the builders . "
but it happened that when San@@ ball@@ at , Tob@@ i@@ ah , the Arab@@ ians , the Am@@ mon@@ ites , and the Ash@@ do@@ d@@ ites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward , and that the breaches began to be filled , then they were very angry ;
our adversaries said , " They shall not know , neither see , until we come into their midst , and kill them , and cause the work to cease . "
it happened that when the Jews who lived by them came , they said to us ten times from all places , " W@@ her@@ ever you turn , they will attack us . "
therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall , in the open places , I set the people after their families with their s@@ words , their spe@@ ars , and their b@@ ows .
it happened , when our enemies heard that it was known to us , and God had brought their counsel to nothing , that we returned all of us to the wall , everyone to his work .
I said to the no@@ bles , and to the rulers and to the rest of the people , " The work is great and large , and we are separated on the wall , one far from another .
likewise at the same time said I to the people , " Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem , that in the night they may be a guard to us , and may labor in the day . "
for there were that said , " We , our sons and our daughters , are many . let us get grain , that we may eat and live . "
some also there were that said , " We are mortg@@ aging our fields , and our vineyards , and our houses . let us get grain , because of the famine . "
then I consulted with myself , and cont@@ ended with the no@@ bles and the rulers , and said to them , " You exact us@@ ury , everyone of his brother . " I held a great assembly against them .
also I said , " The thing that you do is not good . ought you not to walk in the fear of our God , because of the repro@@ ach of the nations our enemies ?
please restore to them , even this day , their fields , their vineyards , their olive gro@@ ves , and their houses , also the hundre@@ d@@ th part of the money , and of the grain , the new wine , and the oil , that you are charging them . "
then they said , " We will restore them , and will require nothing of them ; so will we do , even as you say . " then I called the priests , and took an oath of them , that they would do according to this promise .
that San@@ ball@@ at and G@@ es@@ hem sent to me , saying , " Come , let us meet together in the villages in the plain of O@@ no . " but they intended to harm me .
I sent messengers to them , saying , " I am doing a great work , so that I can '@@ t come down . why should the work cease , while I leave it , and come down to you ? "
in which was written , " It is reported among the nations , and G@@ ash@@ m@@ u says it , that you and the Jews intend to rebel . because of that , you are building the wall . you would be their king , according to these words .
you have also appointed prophets to preach of you at Jerusalem , saying , ' There is a king in Jud@@ ah ! ' now it will be reported to the king according to these words . come now therefore , and let us take counsel together . "
then I sent to him , saying , " There are no such things done as you say , but you imagine them out of your own heart . "
for they all would have made us afraid , saying , " Their hands will be weakened from the work , that it not be done . but now , strengthen my hands . "
I said , " Should such a man as I flee ? who is there that , being such as I , would go into the temple to save his life ? I will not go in . "
" remember , my God , Tob@@ i@@ ah and San@@ ball@@ at according to these their works , and also the proph@@ et@@ ess No@@ adi@@ ah , and the rest of the prophets , that would have put me in fear . "
so the wall was finished in the twenty @@@ -@@ @ fifth day of E@@ lu@@ l , in fifty @@@ -@@ @ two days .
it happened , when all our enemies heard of it , that all the nations that were about us were afraid , and were much cast down in their own eyes ; for they perceived that this work was worked of our God .
for there were many in Jud@@ ah sworn to him , because he was the son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law of Sh@@ ec@@ ani@@ ah the son of Ara@@ h ; and his son Je@@ ho@@ han@@ an had taken the daughter of M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lam the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah as wife .
now it happened , when the wall was built , and I had set up the doors , and the porters and the singers and the Lev@@ ites were appointed ,
that I put my brother Han@@ ani , and Han@@ ani@@ ah the governor of the castle , in charge of Jerusalem ; for he was a faithful man , and feared God above many .
the children of Sh@@ eph@@ ati@@ ah , the children of Hat@@ til , the children of Po@@ cher@@ eth Haz@@ ze@@ bai@@ m , the children of Am@@ on .
of the priests : the children of Hob@@ aiah , the children of Hak@@ ko@@ z , the children of Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i , who took a wife of the daughters of Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i the Gil@@ e@@ ad@@ ite , and was called after their name .
these searched for their gene@@ ological records , but cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t find them . therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood .
the governor said to them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , until there stood up a priest with Uri@@ m and T@@ hum@@ mi@@ m .
besides their male servants and their female servants , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty @@@ -@@ @ seven : and they had two hundred forty @@@ -@@ @ five singing men and singing women .
some from among the heads of fathers ' households gave to the work . the governor gave to the treasury one thousand dar@@ ics of gold , fifty basins , and five hundred thirty priests ' garments .
some of the heads of fathers ' households gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand dar@@ ics of gold , and two thousand two hundred Min@@ as of silver .
E@@ z@@ ra the priest brought the law before the assembly , both men and women , and all who could hear with understanding , on the first day of the seventh month .
he read therein before the broad place that was before the water gate from early morning until mid@@ day , in the presence of the men and the women , and of those who could understand ; and the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law .
E@@ z@@ ra opened the book in the sight of all the people ; ( for he was above all the people ; ) and when he opened it , all the people stood up :
and E@@ z@@ ra blessed Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the great God . all the people answered , " A@@ men , A@@ men , " with the lifting up of their hands . they bowed their heads , and worshi@@ ped Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h with their faces to the ground .
so the Lev@@ ites sti@@ l@@ led all the people , saying , " Hold your peace , for the day is holy ; neither be griev@@ ed . "
all the people went their way to eat , and to drink , and to send portions , and to make great mir@@ th , because they had understood the words that were declared to them .
they found written in the law , how that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had commanded by Moses , that the children of Israel should dwell in boo@@ ths in the feast of the seventh month ;
so the people went out , and brought them , and made themselves boo@@ ths , everyone on the roof of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of God 's house , and in the broad place of the water gate , and in the broad place of the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
now in the twenty @@@ -@@ @ fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting , and with s@@ ack@@ cloth , and earth on them .
then Jes@@ hua , and B@@ ani , Kad@@ mi@@ el , She@@ ban@@ i@@ ah , Bun@@ ni , S@@ here@@ bi@@ ah , B@@ ani , and Chen@@ ani of the Lev@@ ites stood up on the stairs , and cried with a loud voice to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God .
you are Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God who chose Ab@@ ram , and brought him out of U@@ r of the Chal@@ de@@ es , and gave him the name of Abraham ,
and found his heart faithful before you , and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , the Hit@@ tite , the A@@ mor@@ ite , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , and the Je@@ bus@@ ite , and the Gir@@ g@@ ash@@ ite , to give it to his seed , and have performed your words ; for you are righteous .
you divided the sea before them , so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land ; and you cast their pursu@@ ers into the depths , as a stone into the mighty waters .
and made known to them your holy Sabbath , and commanded them commandments , and statutes , and a law , by Moses your servant ,
yes , when they had made them a mol@@ ten cal@@ f , and said , ' This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt , ' and had committed awful bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ies ;
moreover you gave them king@@ doms and peoples , which you allo@@ tted according to their portions . so they possessed the land of Si@@ hon , even the land of the king of H@@ esh@@ bon , and the land of O@@ g king of Bash@@ an .
you also multiplied their children as the stars of the sky , and brought them into the land concerning which you said to their fathers , that they should go in to possess it .
" so the children went in and possessed the land , and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land , the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and gave them into their hands , with their kings , and the peoples of the land , that they might do with them as they pleased .
" nevertheless they were dis@@ obedient , and reb@@ elled against you , and cast your law behind their back , and killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you , and they committed awful bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ies .
yet many years you put up with them , and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets . yet would they not give ear . therefore you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands .
however you are just in all that has come on us ; for you have dealt truly , but we have done w@@ ick@@ edly ;
" behold , we are servants this day , and as for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat its fruit and its good , behold , we are servants in it .
yet for all this , we make a sure covenant , and write it ; and our princes , our Lev@@ ites , and our priests , seal it . "
and that we would not give our daughters to the peoples of the land , nor take their daughters for our sons ;
also we made ordin@@ ances for ourselves , to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a she@@ kel for the service of the house of our God ;
the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Lev@@ ites , when the Lev@@ ites take ti@@ thes : and the Lev@@ ites shall bring up the ti@@ the of the ti@@ thes to the house of our God , to the rooms , into the treasure house .
now these are the chiefs of the province who lived in Jerusalem ; but in the cities of Jud@@ ah everyone lived in his possession in their cities : Israel , the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , and the Ne@@ thin@@ im , and the children of Solomon 's servants .
Ser@@ aiah the son of Hil@@ ki@@ ah , the son of M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lam , the son of Z@@ ad@@ ok , the son of Mer@@ ai@@ o@@ th , the son of Ah@@ it@@ u@@ b , the ruler of God 's house ,
and their brothers who did the work of the house , eight hundred twenty @@@ -@@ @ two ; and Ad@@ aiah the son of J@@ ero@@ ham , the son of Pel@@ ali@@ ah , the son of Am@@ zi , the son of Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , the son of Pash@@ hu@@ r , the son of Mal@@ chi@@ jah ,
and his brothers , chiefs of fathers ' households , two hundred forty @@@ -@@ @ two ; and Am@@ ash@@ s@@ ai the son of Az@@ arel , the son of Ah@@ zai , the son of M@@ esh@@ ill@@ emo@@ th , the son of Im@@ mer ,
and their brothers , mighty men of val@@ or , one hundred twenty @@@ -@@ @ eight ; and their over@@ se@@ er was Zab@@ di@@ el , the son of H@@ agg@@ ed@@ ol@@ im .
of the Lev@@ ites : Sh@@ em@@ aiah the son of Has@@ shu@@ b , the son of Az@@ ri@@ k@@ am , the son of H@@ ash@@ ab@@ i@@ ah , the son of Bun@@ ni ;
and M@@ att@@ ani@@ ah the son of Mic@@ a , the son of Zab@@ di , the son of As@@ ap@@ h , who was the chief to begin the thank@@ s@@ giving in prayer , and Bak@@ bu@@ ki@@ ah , the second among his brothers ; and Ab@@ da the son of Sham@@ mu@@ a , the son of Gal@@ al , the son of J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n .
moreover the porters , Ak@@ ku@@ b , Tal@@ mon , and their brothers , who kept watch at the gates , were one hundred seventy @@@ -@@ @ two .
the over@@ se@@ er also of the Lev@@ ites at Jerusalem was Uz@@ zi the son of B@@ ani , the son of H@@ ash@@ ab@@ i@@ ah , the son of M@@ att@@ ani@@ ah , the son of Mic@@ a , of the sons of As@@ ap@@ h , the singers , over the business of God 's house .
S@@ all@@ u , am@@ ok , Hil@@ ki@@ ah , J@@ ed@@ aiah . these were the chiefs of the priests and of their brothers in the days of Jes@@ hua .
these were in the days of Jo@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jes@@ hua , the son of Jo@@ z@@ ad@@ ak , and in the days of Ne@@ h@@ emi@@ ah the governor , and of E@@ z@@ ra the priest the scri@@ be .
then I brought up the princes of Jud@@ ah on the wall , and appointed two great companies who gave thanks and went in procession . one went on the right hand on the wall toward the d@@ ung gate ;
and his brothers , Sh@@ em@@ aiah , and Az@@ arel , Mil@@ al@@ ai , Gil@@ al@@ ai , Ma@@ ai , N@@ eth@@ an@@ el , and Jud@@ ah , Han@@ ani , with the musical instruments of David the man of God ; and E@@ z@@ ra the scri@@ be was before them .
by the spring gate , and straight before them , they went up by the stairs of the city of David , at the ascent of the wall , above the house of David , even to the water gate eastward .
they offered great sacrifices that day , and rejo@@ iced ; for God had made them rejoice with great joy ; and the women also and the children rejo@@ iced : so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even af@@ ar off .
for in the days of David and As@@ ap@@ h of old there was a chief of the singers , and songs of praise and thank@@ s@@ giving to God .
on that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that an Am@@ mon@@ ite and a Mo@@ ab@@ ite should not enter into the assembly of God forever ,
because they did@@ n '@@ t meet the children of Israel with bread and with water , but hired Bal@@ a@@ am against them , to curse them : however our God turned the curse into a blessing .
now before this , Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the priest , who was appointed over the rooms of the house of our God , being allied to Tob@@ i@@ ah ,
but in all this , I was not at Jerusalem ; for in the two and thir@@ ti@@ eth year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ xes king of Babylon I went to the king : and after certain days asked I leave of the king ,
and I came to Jerusalem , and understood the evil that Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b had done for Tob@@ i@@ ah , in preparing him a room in the courts of God 's house .
then I commanded , and they cleans@@ ed the rooms : and there brought I again the vessels of God 's house , with the meal offerings and the frank@@ inc@@ ense .
I perceived that the portions of the Lev@@ ites had not been given them ; so that the Lev@@ ites and the singers , who did the work , had fled everyone to his field .
then I cont@@ ended with the rulers , and said , " Why is God 's house for@@ s@@ aken ? " I gathered them together , and set them in their place .
then brought all Jud@@ ah the ti@@ the of the grain and the new wine and the oil to the treas@@ uries .
then I cont@@ ended with the no@@ bles of Jud@@ ah , and said to them , " What evil thing is this that you do , and prof@@ ane the Sabbath day ?
then I testified against them , and said to them , " Why do you stay around the wall ? if you do so again , I will lay hands on you . " from that time on , they did@@ n '@@ t come on the Sabbath .
I commanded the Lev@@ ites that they should puri@@ fy themselves , and that they should come and keep the gates , to sancti@@ fy the Sabbath day . remember to me , my God , this also , and spare me according to the greatness of your loving kindness .
one of the sons of Jo@@ i@@ ada , the son of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the high priest , was son @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law to San@@ ball@@ at the Hor@@ on@@ ite : therefore I ch@@ ased him from me .
and for the wood offering , at times appointed , and for the first fruits . remember me , my God , for good .
now it happened in the days of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us ( this is Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us who re@@ igned from India even to Ethiopia , over one hundred twenty @@@ -@@ @ seven provinces ) ,
in the third year of his reign , he made a feast for all his princes and his servants ; the power of Persia and Media , the no@@ bles and princes of the provinces , being before him .
when these days were fulfilled , the king made a seven day feast for all the people who were present in Sh@@ ush@@ an the palace , both great and small , in the court of the garden of the king 's palace .
also V@@ ash@@ ti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
on the seventh day , when the heart of the king was mer@@ ry with wine , he commanded Me@@ human , Biz@@ tha , Har@@ bon@@ a , B@@ ig@@ tha , and Ab@@ ag@@ tha , Z@@ eth@@ ar , and Car@@ c@@ ass , the seven e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s who served in the presence of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us the king ,
and the next to him were Car@@ sh@@ ena , She@@ th@@ ar , Ad@@ ma@@ tha , Tar@@ sh@@ ish , Mer@@ es , Mar@@ sen@@ a , and Mem@@ uc@@ an , the seven princes of Persia and Media , who saw the king 's face , and sat first in the kingdom ) ,
" what shall we do to the queen V@@ ash@@ ti according to law , because she has not done the bidding of the King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us by the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s ? "
Mem@@ uc@@ an answered before the king and the princes , " V@@ ash@@ ti the queen has not done wrong to just the king , but also to all the princes , and to all the people who are in all the provinces of the King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
for this deed of the queen will become known to all women , causing them to show contempt for their husbands , when it is reported , ' King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us commanded V@@ ash@@ ti the queen to be brought in before him , but she did@@ n '@@ t come . '
when the king 's decree which he shall make is published throughout all his kingdom ( for it is great ) , all the wives will give their husbands honor , both great and small . "
there was a certain Jew in the cit@@ ad@@ el of Sus@@ a , whose name was Mor@@ dec@@ ai , the son of J@@ air , the son of Shim@@ ei , the son of K@@ ish , a Ben@@ jam@@ ite ,
who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the cap@@ tives who had been carried away with J@@ econ@@ i@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king of Babylon had carried away .
Mor@@ dec@@ ai walked every day in front of the court of the women 's house , to find out how Es@@ ther was doing , and what would become of her .
the young woman then came to the king like this : whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the women 's house to the king 's house .
the king loved Es@@ ther more than all the women , and she obtained favor and kindness in his sight more than all the vir@@ gins ; so that he set the royal crown on her head , and made her queen instead of V@@ ash@@ ti .
then the king made a great feast for all his princes and his servants , even Es@@ ther 's feast ; and he proclaimed a holiday in the provinces , and gave gifts according to the king 's boun@@ ty .
in those days , while Mor@@ dec@@ ai was sitting in the king 's gate , two of the king 's e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , B@@ ig@@ than and Ter@@ esh , who were door@@ keepers , were angry , and sought to lay hands on the King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
this thing became known to Mor@@ dec@@ ai , who informed Es@@ ther the queen ; and Es@@ ther informed the king in Mor@@ dec@@ ai 's name .
all the king 's servants who were in the king 's gate bowed down , and paid hom@@ age to Ham@@ an ; for the king had so commanded concerning him . but Mor@@ dec@@ ai did@@ n '@@ t bow down or pay him hom@@ age .
the king said to Ham@@ an , " The silver is given to you , the people also , to do with them as it seems good to you . "
a copy of the letter , that the decree should be given out in every province , was published to all the peoples , that they should be ready against that day .
the cou@@ ri@@ ers went forth in ha@@ ste by the king 's commandment , and the decree was given out in the cit@@ ad@@ el of Sus@@ a . the king and Ham@@ an sat down to drink ; but the city of Sh@@ ush@@ an was perpl@@ exed .
now when Mor@@ dec@@ ai found out all that was done , Mor@@ dec@@ ai t@@ ore his clothes , and put on s@@ ack@@ cloth with ashes , and went out into the midst of the city , and w@@ ailed loudly and a bit@@ terly .
he came even before the king 's gate , for no one is allowed inside the king 's gate clo@@ thed with s@@ ack@@ cloth .
then Es@@ ther called for H@@ ath@@ ach , one of the king 's e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , whom he had appointed to attend her , and commanded him to go to Mor@@ dec@@ ai , to find out what this was , and why it was .
then Mor@@ dec@@ ai asked them return answer to Es@@ ther , " Don '@@ t think to yourself that you will escape in the king 's house any more than all the Jews .
then the king asked her , " What would you like , queen Es@@ ther ? what is your request ? it shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom . "
Es@@ ther said , " If it seems good to the king , let the king and Ham@@ an come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him . "
then the king said , " B@@ ring Ham@@ an quickly , so that it may be done as Es@@ ther has said . " so the king and Ham@@ an came to the banquet that Es@@ ther had prepared .
the king said to Es@@ ther at the banquet of wine , " What is your petition ? it shall be granted you . what is your request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed . "
if I have found favor in the sight of the king , and if it please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request , let the king and Ham@@ an come to the banquet that I will prepare for them , and I will do tomorrow as the king has said . "
Ham@@ an recoun@@ ted to them the glory of his riches , the multitude of his children , all the things in which the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
Ham@@ an also said , " Yes , Es@@ ther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself ; and tomorrow I am also invited by her together with the king .
on that night , the king cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t sleep . he commanded the book of records of the chron@@ icles to be brought , and they were read to the king .
it was found written that Mor@@ dec@@ ai had told of B@@ ig@@ th@@ ana and Ter@@ esh , two of the king 's e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , who were door@@ keepers , who had tried to lay hands on the King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
the king said , " What honor and dignity has been bestowed on Mor@@ dec@@ ai for this ? " then the king 's servants who attended him said , " No@@ thing has been done for him . "
the king said , " Who is in the court ? " now Ham@@ an had come into the outer court of the king 's house , to speak to the king about hanging Mor@@ dec@@ ai on the g@@ allows that he had prepared for him .
so Ham@@ an came in . the king said to him , " What shall be done to the man whom the king deli@@ ghts to honor ? " now Ham@@ an said in his heart , " Who would the king delight to honor more than myself ? "
let royal clothing be brought which the king uses to wear , and the horse that the king rides on , and on the head of which a crown royal is set .
then the king said to Ham@@ an , " Hur@@ ry and take the clothing and the horse , as you have said , and do this for Mor@@ dec@@ ai the Jew , who sits at the king 's gate . let nothing fail of all that you have spoken . "
then Ham@@ an took the clothing and the horse , and ar@@ ra@@ yed Mor@@ dec@@ ai , and had him ride through the city square , and proclaimed before him , " Th@@ us shall it be done to the man whom the king deli@@ ghts to honor ! "
the king said again to Es@@ ther on the second day at the banquet of wine , " What is your petition , queen Es@@ ther ? it shall be granted you . what is your request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed . "
Es@@ ther said , " An adversary and an enemy , even this wicked Ham@@ an ! " then Ham@@ an was afraid before the king and the queen .
the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden . Ham@@ an stood up to make request for his life to Es@@ ther the queen ; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king .
on that day , King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us gave the house of Ham@@ an , the Jews ' enemy , to Es@@ ther the queen . Mor@@ dec@@ ai came before the king ; for Es@@ ther had told what he was to her .
Es@@ ther spoke yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet , and beg@@ ged him with tears to put away the mis@@ chief of Ham@@ an the Ag@@ ag@@ ite , and his device that he had devised against the Jews .
for how can I endure to see the evil that would come to my people ? how can I endure to see the destruction of my relatives ? "
then King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us said to Es@@ ther the queen and to Mor@@ dec@@ ai the Jew , " See , I have given Es@@ ther the house of Ham@@ an , and him they have han@@ ged on the g@@ allows , because he laid his hand on the Jews .
he wrote in the name of King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , and sealed it with the king 's ring , and sent letters by cou@@ rier on horse@@ back , riding on royal horses that were bread from swift ste@@ eds .
on one day in all the provinces of King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , on the thir@@ teenth day of the twel@@ fth month , which is the month Ad@@ ar .
a copy of the letter , that the decree should be given out in every province , was published to all the peoples , that the Jews should be ready for that day to av@@ enge themselves on their enemies .
Mor@@ dec@@ ai went out of the presence of the king in royal clothing of blue and white , and with a great crown of gold , and with a robe of fine linen and purple ; and the city of Sus@@ a shouted and was glad .
the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the King Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , to lay hands on those who wanted to harm them . no one could withstand them , because the fear of them had fallen on all the people .
all the princes of the provinces , the sat@@ rap@@ s , the governors , and those who did the king 's business helped the Jews , because the fear of Mor@@ dec@@ ai had fallen on them .
the Jews struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword , and with slaughter and destruction , and did what they wanted to those who hated them .
on that day , the number of those who were sl@@ ain in the cit@@ ad@@ el of Sus@@ a was brought before the king .
the Jews who were in Sh@@ ush@@ an gathered themselves together on the four@@ teenth day also of the month Ad@@ ar , and killed three hundred men in Sh@@ ush@@ an ; but they did@@ n '@@ t lay their hand on the spoil .
this was done on the thir@@ teenth day of the month Ad@@ ar ; and on the four@@ teenth day of that month they rested and made it a day of fe@@ asting and gl@@ ad@@ ness .
but the Jews who were in Sh@@ ush@@ an assembled together on the thir@@ teenth and on the four@@ teenth days of the month ; and on the fif@@ teenth day of that month , they rested , and made it a day of fe@@ asting and gl@@ ad@@ ness .
therefore they called these days " Pur@@ im , " from the word " P@@ ur . " therefore because of all the words of this letter , and of that which they had seen concerning this matter , and that which had come to them ,
all the acts of his power and of his might , and the full account of the greatness of Mor@@ dec@@ ai , to which the king advanced him , are@@ n '@@ t they written in the book of the chron@@ icles of the kings of Media and Persia ?
there was a man in the land of U@@ z , whose name was Job . that man was bl@@ am@@ eless and upright , and one who feared God , and turned away from evil .
his possessions also were seven thousand sheep , three thousand cam@@ els , five hundred y@@ oke of ox@@ en , five hundred female don@@ keys , and a very great household ; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east .
his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one on his birthday ; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them .
now it happened on the day when God 's sons came to present themselves before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that Satan also came among them .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Satan , " Have you considered my servant , Job ? for there is none like him in the earth , a bl@@ am@@ eless and an upright man , one who fears God , and turns away from evil . "
haven '@@ t you made a hedge around him , and around his house , and around all that he has , on every side ? you have blessed the work of his hands , and his substance is increased in the land .
but put forth your hand now , and touch all that he has , and he will renounce you to your face . "
while he was still speaking , there also came another , and said , " The fire of God has fallen from the sky , and has burned up the sheep and the servants , and consumed them , and I alone have escaped to tell you . "
while he was still speaking , there came also another , and said , " The Chal@@ de@@ ans made three bands , and swept down on the cam@@ els , and have taken them away , yes , and killed the servants with the edge of the sword ; and I alone have escaped to tell you . "
while he was still speaking , there came also another , and said , " Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their el@@ dest brother 's house ,
and behold , there came a great wind from the wilderness , and struck the four corners of the house , and it fell on the young men , and they are dead . I alone have escaped to tell you . "
then Job arose , and t@@ ore his robe , and sha@@ ved his head , and fell down on the ground , and worshi@@ ped .
he said , " N@@ aked I came out of my mother 's womb , and naked shall I return there . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h gave , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has taken away . blessed be the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
again it happened on the day when the God 's sons came to present themselves before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that Satan came also among them to present himself before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
but put forth your hand now , and touch his bone and his flesh , and he will renounce you to your face . "
so Satan went forth from the presence of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and struck Job with painful so@@ res from the sole of his foot to his head .
but he said to her , " You speak as one of the foolish women would speak . what ? shall we receive good at the hand of God , and shall we not receive evil ? " in all this Job did@@ n '@@ t sin with his lips .
when they lifted up their eyes from a distance , and did@@ n '@@ t recognize him , they raised their voices , and we@@ pt ; and they each t@@ ore his robe , and sprink@@ led dust on their heads toward the sky .
" let the day perish in which I was born , the night which said , ' There is a boy conceived . '
let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own . let a cloud dwell on it . let all that makes black the day terri@@ fy it .
as for that night , let thick darkness seize on it . let it not rejoice among the days of the year . let it not come into the number of the months .
how much more , those who dwell in houses of clay , whose foundation is in the dust , who are crushed before the moth !
he frustr@@ ates the devices of the cra@@ fty , So that their hands can '@@ t perform their enterprise .
but he saves from the sword of their mouth , even the ne@@ edy from the hand of the mighty .
" behold , happy is the man whom God correc@@ ts . therefore do not desp@@ ise the cha@@ st@@ ening of the Almighty .
for you shall be allied with the stones of the field . the animals of the field shall be at peace with you .
you shall come to your grave in a full age , like a shock of grain comes in its season .
even that it would please God to crush me ; that he would let loose his hand , and cut me off !
be it still my consolation , yes , let me ex@@ ult in pain that do@@ es@@ n '@@ t spare , that I have not denied the words of the Holy One .
when I lie down , I say , ' When shall I arise , and the night be gone ? ' I tos@@ s and turn until the d@@ aw@@ ning of the day .
my flesh is clo@@ thed with worms and clo@@ ds of dust . my skin closes up , and breaks out af@@ resh .
" therefore I will not keep silent . I will speak in the angu@@ ish of my spirit . I will complain in the bitterness of my soul .
I lo@@ a@@ the my life . I don '@@ t want to live forever . leave me alone , for my days are but a breath .
if I have sin@@ ned , what do I do to you , you wat@@ cher of men ? why have you set me as a mark for you , so that I am a burden to myself ?
" how long will you speak these things ? shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind ?
God who is wise in heart , and mighty in strength : who has hardened himself against him , and prosper@@ ed ?
the earth is given into the hand of the wicked . he covers the faces of its judges . if not he , then who is it ?
they have passed away as the swift ships , as the eagle that sw@@ o@@ ops on the prey .
is it good to you that you should op@@ press , that you should desp@@ ise the work of your hands , and smile on the counsel of the wicked ?
you have clo@@ thed me with skin and flesh , and knit me together with bones and sin@@ ews .
if I am wicked , w@@ oe to me . if I am righteous , I still shall not lift up my head , being filled with dis@@ grace , and conscious of my afflic@@ tion .
you shall be secure , because there is hope . yes , you shall search , and shall take your rest in safety .
I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor , I , who called on God , and he answered . the just , the bl@@ am@@ eless man is a joke .
" but ask the animals , now , and they shall teach you ; the birds of the sky , and they shall tell you .
or speak to the earth , and it shall teach you . the fish of the sea shall declare to you .
he un@@ covers deep things out of darkness , and brings out to light the shadow of death .
you also put my feet in the stocks , and mark all my paths . you set a bound to the sol@@ es of my feet ,
he comes forth like a flower , and is cut down . he also fle@@ es like a shadow , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t continue .
" for there is hope for a tree , If it is cut down , that it will spr@@ out again , that the tender branch of it will not cease .
" Oh that you would hide me in She@@ ol , that you would keep me secret , until your wrath is past , that you would appoint me a set time , and remember me !
" should a wise man answer with vain knowledge , and fill himself with the east wind ?
behold , he puts no trust in his holy ones . yes , the heavens are not clean in his sight ;
he w@@ and@@ ers abroad for bread , saying , ' Where is it ? ' he knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand .
you have sh@@ riv@@ eled me up . this is a witness against me . my lean@@ ness rises up against me . it testi@@ fies to my face .
he has torn me in his wrath , and persecuted me . he has gn@@ ashed on me with his teeth . my adversary sharpen@@ s his eyes on me .
they have g@@ aped on me with their mouth . they have struck me on the cheek repro@@ ach@@ fully . they gather themselves together against me .
his arch@@ ers surround me . he spl@@ its my kidneys apart , and does not spare . he p@@ ours out my g@@ all on the ground .
they change the night into day , saying ' The light is near ' in the presence of darkness .
for he is cast into a net by his own feet , and he w@@ and@@ ers into its mesh .
he has broken me down on every side , and I am gone . my hope he has pl@@ ucked up like a tree .
those who dwell in my house , and my m@@ aids , count me for a stranger . I am an alien in their sight .
" have pity on me , have pity on me , you my friends ; for the hand of God has touched me .
whom I , even I , shall see on my side . my eyes shall see , and not as a stranger . " my heart is consumed within me .
" because he knew no qui@@ et@@ ness within him , he shall not save anything of that in which he deli@@ ghts .
when he is about to fill his belly , God will cast the fierc@@ eness of his wrath on him . it will rain on him while he is eating .
" how often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out , that their calamity comes on them , that God distributes sor@@ rows in his anger ?
how often is it that they are as stub@@ ble before the wind , as cha@@ ff that the storm carries away ?
for you say , ' Where is the house of the prince ? where is the tent in which the wicked lived ? '
" can a man be profitable to God ? surely he who is wise is profitable to himself .
" is@@ n '@@ t God in the heights of heaven ? see the height of the stars , how high they are !
thick clouds are a covering to him , so that he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t see . he walks on the vault of the sky . '
yet he filled their houses with good things , but the counsel of the wicked is far from me .
for then you will delight yourself in the Almighty , and shall lift up your face to God .
you shall make your prayer to him , and he will hear you . you shall pay your v@@ ows .
when they cast down , you shall say , ' be lifted up . ' he will save the humble person .
he works to the north , but I can '@@ t see him . he turns south , but I can '@@ t catch a glimpse of him .
but he knows the way that I take . when he has tried me , I shall come forth like gold .
they are wet with the showers of the mountains , and embrace the rock for lack of a shelter .
" these are of those who rebel against the light . they don '@@ t know its ways , nor stay in its paths .
the eye also of the adul@@ ter@@ er waits for the tw@@ ilight , saying , ' No eye shall see me . ' he disgu@@ ises his face .
in the dark they dig through houses . they shut themselves up in the daytime . they don '@@ t know the light .
" they are foam on the surface of the waters . their portion is cur@@ sed in the earth . they don '@@ t turn into the way of the vineyards .
how then can man be just with God ? or how can he who is born of a woman be clean ?
behold , these are but the outskirts of his ways . how small a whis@@ per do we hear of him ! but the thunder of his power who can understand ? "
I hold fast to my righteousness , and will not let it go . my heart shall not repro@@ ach me so long as I live .
" let my enemy be as the wicked . let him who rises up against me be as the un@@ righteous .
I will teach you about the hand of God . that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal .
" this is the portion of a wicked man with God , the heritage of op@@ pres@@ sors , which they receive from the Almighty .
no mention shall be made of coral or of crystal . yes , the price of wisdom is above rub@@ ies .
then he saw it , and declared it . he established it , yes , and searched it out .
to man he said , ' Be@@ hold , the fear of the Lord , that is wisdom . to depart from evil is understanding . ' "
I was a father to the ne@@ edy . the cause of him who I did@@ n '@@ t know , I searched out .
I chose out their way , and sat as chief . I lived as a king in the army , as one who comforts the mour@@ ners .
they are g@@ aunt from lack and famine . they gn@@ aw the dry ground , in the glo@@ om of waste and des@@ ol@@ ation .
so that they dwell in fri@@ ghtful valleys , and in holes of the earth and of the rocks .
" now my soul is poured out within me . days of afflic@@ tion have taken hold on me .
" I made a covenant with my eyes , how then should I look lu@@ st@@ fully at a young woman ?
" if my heart has been entic@@ ed to a woman , and I have laid wait at my neighbor 's door ,
( no , from my youth he grew up with me as with a father , her have I guided from my mother 's womb ) ;
if I have seen any perish for want of clothing , or that the ne@@ edy had no covering ;
" if I have made gold my hope , and have said to the fine gold , ' You are my confidence ; '
if the men of my tent have not said , ' Who can find one who has not been filled with his meat ? '
Oh that I had one to hear me ! ( behold , here is my signature , let the Almighty answer me ) ; let the acc@@ user write my indictment !
let bri@@ ars grow instead of wheat , and st@@ ink@@ weed instead of barley . " the words of Job are ended .
then the wrath of Eli@@ hu the son of Bar@@ ach@@ el , the Bu@@ z@@ ite , of the family of R@@ am , was kind@@ led against Job . his wrath was kind@@ led because he justified himself rather than God .
for I don '@@ t know how to give fl@@ attering titles ; or else my Maker would soon take me away .
the Spirit of God has made me , and the breath of the Almighty gives me life .
" behold , I will answer you . in this you are not just , for God is greater than man .
" if there is beside him an angel , an interpreter , one among a thousand , to show to man what is right for him ;
he s@@ ings before men , and says , ' I have sin@@ ned , and perver@@ ted that which was right , and it did@@ n '@@ t profit me .
" behold , God works all these things , twice , yes three times , with a man ,
who put him in charge of the earth ? or who has appointed him over the whole world ?
shall even one who h@@ ates justice govern ? will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty ? --
in a moment they die , even at midnight . the people are shaken and pass away . the mighty are taken away without a hand .
therefore he takes knowledge of their works . he over@@ turns them in the night , so that they are destroyed .
if you have sin@@ ned , what effect do you have against him ? if your trans@@ gres@@ sions are multiplied , what do you do to him ?
who teaches us more than the animals of the earth , and makes us wis@@ er than the birds of the sky ? '
" bear with me a little , and I will show you ; for I still have something to say on God 's behalf .
he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t withdraw his eyes from the righteous , but with kings on the throne , he sets them forever , and they are exalted .
but if they don '@@ t listen , they shall perish by the sword ; they shall die without knowledge .
yes , he would have all@@ ured you out of distress , into a broad place , where there is no restriction . that which is set on your table would be full of fat@@ ness .
Don '@@ t let riches enti@@ ce you to wrath , neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside .
who has prescribed his way for him ? or who can say , ' You have committed un@@ righteousness ? '
" listen to this , Job . stand still , and consider the won@@ dr@@ ous works of God .
you whose clothing is warm , when the earth is still by reason of the south wind ?
and said , ' Here you may come , but no further . here your proud waves shall be stayed ? '
have the gates of death been revealed to you ? or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death ?
out of whose womb came the ice ? the gray frost of the sky , who has given birth to it ?
can you lead forth the const@@ ellations in their season ? or can you guide the Bear with her c@@ ubs ?
can you send forth light@@ nings , that they may go ? do they report to you , ' Here we are ? '
who has put wisdom in the inward parts ? or who has given understanding to the mind ?
can you number the months that they fulfill ? or do you know the time when they give birth ?
their young ones become strong . they grow up in the open field . they go forth , and don '@@ t return again .

behold , the hope of him is in vain . won '@@ t one be cast down even at the sight of him ?
blessed is the man who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t walk in the counsel of the wicked , nor stand in the way of sinners , nor sit in the seat of s@@ coff@@ ers ;

& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; A Psal@@ m by David , for a memorial . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , don '@@ t rebu@@ ke me in your wrath , neither cha@@ sten me in your hot dis@@ pleasure .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; For the Chief Mus@@ ician . a Psal@@ m by David . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; I waited patiently for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . he turned to me , and heard my cry .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; For the Chief Mus@@ ician . a Psal@@ m by David . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; Bless@@ ed is he who considers the poor . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will deliver him in the day of evil .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; For the Chief Mus@@ ician . a contempl@@ ation by the sons of Kor@@ ah . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; As the deer pants for the water bro@@ o@@ ks , so my soul pants after you , God .
for they did@@ n '@@ t get the land in possession by their own sword , neither did their own arm save them ; but your right hand , and your arm , and the light of your face , because you were favorable to them .
in your maj@@ esty ride on vic@@ t@@ oriously on behalf of truth , humility , and righteousness . let your right hand display awesome deeds .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; For the Chief Mus@@ ician . by the sons of Kor@@ ah . according to Al@@ am@@ oth@@ .@@ Al@@ am@@ o@@ th is a musical term . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; God is our refuge and strength , a very present help in trouble .
he makes wars cease to the end of the earth . he breaks the bow , and sh@@ atters the spe@@ ar . he burns the ch@@ ari@@ ots in the fire .
" be still , and know that I am God . I will be exalted among the nations . I will be exalted in the earth . "
the princes of the peoples are gathered together , the people of the God of Abraham . for the shi@@ elds of the earth belong to God . he is greatly exalted !
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; A Song . a Psal@@ m by the sons of Kor@@ ah . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; Great is Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and greatly to be praised , in the city of our God , in his holy mountain .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; For the Chief Mus@@ ician . a Psal@@ m by the sons of Kor@@ ah . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; He@@ ar this , all you peoples . listen , all you inhabitants of the world ,
their inward thought is that their houses will endure forever , and their dwelling places to all generations . they name their lands after themselves .
wash me thoroughly from my ini@@ qu@@ ity . clean@@ se me from my sin .
against you , and you only , have I sin@@ ned , and done that which is evil in your sight ; that you may be proved right when you speak , and justified when you judge .
God will likewise destroy you forever . he will take you up , and pl@@ uck you out of your tent , and root you out of the land of the living . Sel@@ ah .
every one of them has gone back . they have become fil@@ thy together . there is no one who does good , no , not one .
there they were in great fear , where no fear was , for God has scattered the bones of him who enc@@ amps against you . you have put them to shame , because God has rejected them .
Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Z@@ ion ! when God brings back his people from cap@@ tivity , then Jacob shall rejoice , and Israel shall be glad .
with a free will offering , I will sacrifice to you . I will give thanks to your name , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , for it is good .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; For the Chief Mus@@ ician . on str@@ ing@@ ed instruments . a contempl@@ ation by David . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; List@@ en to my prayer , God . Don '@@ t hide yourself from my suppl@@ ication .
for it was not an enemy who insul@@ ted me , then I could have endured it . neither was it he who hated me who raised himself up against me , then I would have hidden myself from him .
he raises his hands against his friends . he has violated his covenant .
shall they escape by ini@@ qu@@ ity ? in anger cast down the peoples , God .
you number my wan@@ der@@ ings . you put my tears into your bottle . are@@ n '@@ t they in your book ?
he will send from heaven , and save me , he rebu@@ kes the one who is pursuing me . Sel@@ ah . God will send out his loving kindness and his truth .
they have prepared a net for my steps . my soul is bowed down . they dig a pit before me . they fall into its midst themselves . Sel@@ ah .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; For the Chief Mus@@ ician . to the tune of " Do Not D@@ estro@@ y . " a poem by David . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; Do you indeed speak righteousness , silent ones ? do you judge bl@@ am@@ el@@ essly , you sons of men ?
but I will sing of your strength . yes , I will sing aloud of your loving kindness in the morning . for you have been my high tower , a refuge in the day of my distress .
you have given a banner to those who fear you , that it may be displayed because of the truth . Sel@@ ah .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; For the Chief Mus@@ ician . to J@@ ed@@ u@@ than . a Psal@@ m by David . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; My soul rests in God alone . my salvation is from him .
surely men of low degree are just a breath , and men of high degree are a lie . in the balances they will go up . they are together lighter than a breath .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; For the Chief Mus@@ ician . a Psal@@ m by David . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; He@@ ar my voice , God , in my complaint . preserve my life from fear of the enemy .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; For the Chief Mus@@ ician . a Psal@@ m by David . a song . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; P@@ raise waits for you , God , in Z@@ ion . to you shall v@@ ows be performed .
blessed is one whom you choose , and cause to come near , that he may live in your courts . we will be filled with the goodness of your house , your holy temple .
by awesome deeds of righteousness , you answer us , God of our salvation . you who are the hope of all the ends of the earth , of those who are far away on the sea ;
they also who dwell in far@@ away places are afraid at your wonders . you call the morning 's dawn and the evening with songs of joy .
the past@@ ures are covered with f@@ locks . the valleys also are clo@@ thed with grain . they shout for joy ! they also sing .
if I cherished sin in my heart , the Lord w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have listened .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; For the Chief Mus@@ ician . with str@@ ing@@ ed instruments . a Psal@@ m . a song . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; May God be mer@@ ciful to us , bless us , and cause his face to shine on us . Sel@@ ah .
Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy , for you will judge the peoples with equity , and govern the nations on earth . Sel@@ ah .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; For the Chief Mus@@ ician . a Psal@@ m by David . a song . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; Let God arise ! let his enemies be scattered ! let them who hate him also flee before him .
you , God , sent a plentiful rain . you confirmed your inheritance , when it was weary .
your congregation lived therein . you , God , prepared your goodness for the poor .
but God will strike through the head of his enemies , the hair@@ y scal@@ p of such a one as still continues in his guil@@ t@@ iness .
the Lord said , " I will bring you again from Bash@@ an , I will bring you again from the depths of the sea ;
rebu@@ ke the wild animal of the re@@ eds , the multitude of the bul@@ ls , with the cal@@ ves of the peoples . being hum@@ bled , may it bring bars of silver . sc@@ atter the nations that delight in war .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; For the Chief Mus@@ ician . to the tune of " L@@ ilies . " by David . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; Save me , God , for the waters have come up to my neck !
those who hate me without a cause are more than the ha@@ irs of my head . those who want to cut me off , being my enemies wrong@@ fully , are mighty . I have to restore what I did@@ n '@@ t take away .
when I we@@ pt and I fast@@ ed , that was to my repro@@ ach .
when I made s@@ ack@@ cloth my clothing , I became a by@@ word to them .
but as for me , my prayer is to you , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , in an acceptable time . God , in the abundance of your loving kindness , answer me in the truth of your salvation .
deliver me out of the mire , and don '@@ t let me sink . let me be delivered from those who hate me , and out of the deep waters .
repro@@ ach has broken my heart , and I am full of heav@@ iness . I looked for some to take pity , but there was none ; for comfor@@ ters , but I found none .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; By Solomon . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; God , give the king your justice ; your righteousness to the royal son .
he will judge the poor of the people . he will save the children of the ne@@ edy , and will break the op@@ pres@@ sor in pieces .
therefore pride is like a chain around their neck . violence covers them like a garment .
now they break all its carved work down with hat@@ ch@@ et and ham@@ mers .
I will cut off all the horns of the wicked , but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; For the Chief Mus@@ ician . on str@@ ing@@ ed instruments . a Psal@@ m by As@@ ap@@ h . a song . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; In Jud@@ ah , God is known . his name is great in Israel .
there he broke the fl@@ aming arrows of the bow , the shield , and the sword , and the weapons of war . Sel@@ ah .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; For the Chief Mus@@ ician . to J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n . a Psal@@ m by As@@ ap@@ h . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; My cry goes to God ! indeed , I cry to God for help , and for him to listen to me .
in the day of my trouble I sought the Lord . my hand was stretched out in the night , and did@@ n '@@ t get tired . my soul refused to be comfor@@ ted .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; A contempl@@ ation by As@@ ap@@ h . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; He@@ ar my teaching , my people . turn your ears to the words of my mouth .
for he established a testimony in Jacob , and appointed a teaching in Israel , which he commanded our fathers , that they should make them known to their children ;
and might not be as their fathers , a stubborn and rebelli@@ ous generation , a generation that did@@ n '@@ t make their hearts loyal , whose spirit was not stead@@ fast with God .
when the anger of God went up against them , killed some of their f@@ attest , and struck down the young men of Israel .
when he killed them , then they inqui@@ red after him . they returned and sought God ear@@ ne@@ stly .
but he , being mer@@ ciful , for@@ gave ini@@ qu@@ ity , and did@@ n '@@ t destroy them . yes , many times he turned his anger away , and did@@ n '@@ t stir up all his wrath .
from following the ew@@ es that have their young , he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob , his people , and Israel , his inheritance .
they have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food for the birds of the sky , the flesh of your saints to the animals of the earth .
let the sigh@@ ing of the prisoner come before you . according to the greatness of your power , preserve those who are sentenced to death .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; For the Chief Mus@@ ician . on an instrument of G@@ ath . by As@@ ap@@ h . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; S@@ ing aloud to God , our strength ! make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob !
but he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat . I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock . "
they don '@@ t know , neither do they understand . they walk back and forth in darkness . all the foundations of the earth are shaken .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; A song . a Psal@@ m by As@@ ap@@ h . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; God , don '@@ t keep silent . Don '@@ t keep silent , and don '@@ t be still , God .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; For the Chief Mus@@ ician . on an instrument of G@@ ath . a Psal@@ m by the sons of Kor@@ ah . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; How lovely are your dwell@@ ings , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies !
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; For the Chief Mus@@ ician . a Psal@@ m by the sons of Kor@@ ah . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , you have been favorable to your land . you have restored the fortunes of Jacob .
show us your loving kindness , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . grant us your salvation .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; A Pra@@ yer by David . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; He@@ ar , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and answer me , for I am poor and ne@@ edy .
teach me your way , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . I will walk in your truth . make my heart un@@ divided to fear your name .
God , the proud have risen up against me . a company of violent men have sought after my soul , and they don '@@ t hold regard for you before them .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h loves the gates of Z@@ ion more than all the dwell@@ ings of Jacob .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; A contempl@@ ation by E@@ than , the E@@ z@@ ra@@ h@@ ite . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; I will sing of the loving kindness of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h forever . with my mouth , I will make known your faith@@ fulness to all generations .
his seed will endure forever , his throne like the sun before me .
he who d@@ wells in the secret place of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty .
your statutes stand firm . Holiness ador@@ ns your house , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , fore@@ ver@@ more .
unless Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had been my help , my soul would have soon lived in silence .
make a joyful noise to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , all the earth ! burst out and sing for joy , yes , sing pra@@ ises !
for my days consume away like smoke . my bones are burned as a torch .
but you , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , will remain forever ; your renow@@ n endu@@ res to all generations .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; By David . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; P@@ raise Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , my soul ! all that is within me , praise his holy name !
but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's loving kindness is from everlasting to everlasting with those who fear him , his righteousness to children 's children ;
to those who keep his covenant , to those who remember to obey his prec@@ epts .
that I may see the prosperity of your chosen , that I may rejoice in the gl@@ ad@@ ness of your nation , that I may glory with your inheritance .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; A Song . a Psal@@ m by David . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; My heart is stead@@ fast , God . I will sing and I will make music with my soul .
for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of dece@@ it against me . they have spoken to me with a lying tongue .
let his days be few . let another take his office .
let there be no one to extend kindness to him , neither let there be anyone to have pity on his fa@@ ther@@ less children .
he clo@@ thed himself also with cur@@ sing as with his garment . it came into his inward parts like water , like oil into his bones .
your people offer themselves willingly in the day of your power , in holy array . out of the womb of the morning , you have the de@@ w of your youth .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has sworn , and will not change his mind : " you are a priest forever in the order of Mel@@ ch@@ iz@@ e@@ de@@ k . "
the wicked will see it , and be griev@@ ed . he shall gn@@ ash with his teeth , and melt away . the desire of the wicked will perish .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h remembers us . he will bless us . he will bless the house of Israel . he will bless the house of Aaron .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; A Song of asc@@ ents . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; In my distress , I cried to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . he answered me .
where the tribes go up , even Y@@ ah 's tribes , according to an ordin@@ ance for Israel , to give thanks to the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
peace be within your walls , and prosperity within your palaces .
surely I have sti@@ l@@ led and qui@@ eted my soul , like a we@@ an@@ ed child with his mother , like a we@@ an@@ ed child is my soul within me .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; A Song of asc@@ ents . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , remember David and all his afflic@@ tion ,
if your children will keep my covenant , my testimony that I will teach them , their children also will sit on your throne fore@@ ver@@ more . "
it is like the precious oil on the head , that ran down on the beard , even Aaron 's beard ; that came down on the edge of his robes ;
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; A Song of asc@@ ents . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; Look ! praise Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , all you servants of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , who stand by night in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's house !
for there , those who led us captive asked us for songs . those who tor@@ m@@ ented us demanded songs of joy : " sing us one of the songs of Z@@ ion ! "
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; For the Chief Mus@@ ician . a Psal@@ m by David . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; Deli@@ ver me , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , from the evil man . preserve me from the violent man ;
the proud have hidden a sn@@ are for me , they have spread the cor@@ ds of a net by the path . they have set traps for me . Sel@@ ah .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; A Psal@@ m by David . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , I have called on you . come to me quickly ! listen to my voice when I call to you .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; A contempl@@ ation by David , when he was in the cave . a Pra@@ yer . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; I cry with my voice to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . with my voice , I ask Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h for mercy .
& l@@ t ; & l@@ t ; A Psal@@ m by David . & g@@ t ; & g@@ t ; He@@ ar my prayer , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . listen to my peti@@ tions . in your faith@@ fulness and righteousness , relieve me .
for the enemy pursues my soul . he has struck my life down to the ground . he has made me live in dark places , as those who have been long dead .
I will sing a new song to you , God . on a ten @@@ -@@ @ str@@ ing@@ ed ly@@ re , I will sing pra@@ ises to you .
he has also established them forever and ever . he has made a decree which will not pass away .
he has lifted up the horn of his people , the praise of all his saints ; even of the children of Israel , a people near to him . praise Y@@ ah !
may the high pra@@ ises of God be in their mouths , and a two @@@ -@@ @ ed@@ ged sword in their hand ;
if they say , " Come with us , Let 's lay in wait for blood ; let 's lur@@ k secretly for the innocent without cause ;
turn at my re@@ proof . behold , I will pour out my spirit on you . I will make known my words to you .
because I have called , and you have refused ; I have stretched out my hand , and no one has paid attention ;
but whoever list@@ ens to me will dwell securely , and will be at ease , without fear of harm . "
she is more precious than rub@@ ies . none of the things you can desire are to be compared to her .
when you lie down , you will not be afraid . yes , you will lie down , and your sleep will be sweet .
Don '@@ t say to your neighbor , " Go , and come again ; tomorrow I will give it to you , " when you have it by you .
I have taught you in the way of wisdom . I have led you in straight paths .
for why should you , my son , be cap@@ tiv@@ ated with an adul@@ ter@@ ess ? why embrace the bos@@ om of another ?
my son , if you have become collateral for your neighbor , if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger ;
to keep you from the immoral woman , from the fl@@ attery of the way@@ ward wife 's tongue .
but if he is found , he shall restore seven times . he shall give all the wealth of his house .
therefore I came out to meet you , to dilig@@ ently seek your face , and I have found you .
on the top of high places by the way , where the paths meet , she stands .
all the words of my mouth are in righteousness . there is nothing cro@@ oked or perverse in them .
for wisdom is better than rub@@ ies . all the things that may be desired can '@@ t be compared to it .
the fear of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is to hate evil . I hate pride , arrogance , the evil way , and the perverse mouth .
while as yet he had not made the earth , nor the fields , nor the beginning of the dust of the world .
" come , eat some of my bread , Dr@@ ink some of the wine which I have mixed !
he who g@@ athers in summer is a wise son , but he who sle@@ eps during the harvest is a son who causes shame .
blessings are on the head of the righteous , but violence covers the mouth of the wicked .
the labor of the righteous leads to life . the increase of the wicked leads to sin .
it is a fool 's pleasure to do w@@ ick@@ edness , but wisdom is a man of understanding 's pleasure .
most certainly , the evil man will not be un@@ punished , but the seed of the righteous will be delivered .
he who troubles his own house shall inherit the wind . the foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart .
the wicked are overthrown , and are no more , but the house of the righteous shall stand .
the way of a fool is right in his own eyes , but he who is wise list@@ ens to counsel .
every wise woman builds her house , but the foolish one tears it down with her own hands .
a s@@ coff@@ er seeks wisdom , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t find it , but knowledge comes easily to a discer@@ ning person .
the un@@ faithful will be repaid for his own ways ; likewise a good man will be rewarded for his ways .
the poor person is shun@@ ned even by his own neighbor , but the rich person has many friends .
in the fear of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is a secure fortress , and he will be a refuge for his children .
he who op@@ presses the poor shows contempt for his Maker , but he who is kind to the ne@@ edy honors him .
the way of the wicked is an ab@@ om@@ ination to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , but he loves him who follows after righteousness .
all the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes ; but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h weighs the motives .
by mercy and truth ini@@ qu@@ ity is at@@ oned for . by the fear of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h men depart from evil .
when a man 's ways please Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him .
understanding is a fountain of life to one who has it , but the punishment of fo@@ ols is their folly .
one who win@@ ks his eyes to plot per@@ versities , one who comp@@ resses his lips , is bent on evil .
arrogant speech is@@ n '@@ t fitting for a fool , much less do lying lips fit a prince .
a bribe is a precious stone in the eyes of him who gives it ; wherever he turns , he prosp@@ ers .
many will entre@@ at the favor of a ruler , and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts .
the king 's wrath is like the ro@@ aring of a lion , but his favor is like de@@ w on the grass .
that which makes a man to be desired is his kindness . a poor man is better than a li@@ ar .
the slugg@@ ard bur@@ ies his hand in the dish ; he will not so much as bring it to his mouth again .
if you stop listening to instruction , my son , you will str@@ ay from the words of knowledge .
the terror of a king is like the ro@@ aring of a lion . he who provo@@ kes him to anger forfe@@ its his own life .
counsel in the heart of man is like deep water ; but a man of understanding will draw it out .
even a child makes himself known by his do@@ ings , whether his work is pure , and whether it is right .
he who goes about as a tale @@@ -@@ @ be@@ arer reveals secrets ; therefore don '@@ t keep company with him who opens wide his lips .
a high look , and a proud heart , the lamp of the wicked , is sin .
the violence of the wicked will drive them away , because they refuse to do what is right .
it is better to dwell in the corner of the hous@@ et@@ op , than to share a house with a contentious woman .
there is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise ; but a foolish man sw@@ allows it up .
a wise man scales the city of the mighty , and brings down the strength of its confidence .
there are those who co@@ vet gre@@ ed@@ ily all day long ; but the righteous give and don '@@ t with@@ hold .
a good name is more desirable than great riches , and loving favor is better than silver and gold .
a prudent man sees danger , and hides himself ; but the simple pass on , and suffer for it .
train up a child in the way he should go , and when he is old he will not depart from it .
drive out the mo@@ cker , and strife will go out ; yes , quar@@ rels and insul@@ ts will stop .
the mouth of an adul@@ ter@@ ess is a deep pit : he who is under Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's wrath will fall into it .
folly is bound up in the heart of a child : the rod of discipline drives it far from him .
Don '@@ t you be one of those who strike hands , of those who are collateral for debts .
Don '@@ t with@@ hold correction from a child . if you punish him with the rod , he will not die .
" they hit me , and I was not hurt ! they beat me , and I don '@@ t feel it ! when will I wake up ? I can do it again . I can find another . "
if you say , " Be@@ hold , we did@@ n '@@ t know this " ; do@@ es@@ n '@@ t he who weighs the hearts consider it ? he who keeps your soul , do@@ es@@ n '@@ t he know it ? shall he not render to every man according to his work ?
so you shall know wisdom to be to your soul ; if you have found it , then there will be a reward , your hope will not be cut off .
for a righteous man falls seven times , and rises up again ; but the wicked are overthrown by calamity .
Don '@@ t say , " I will do to him as he has done to me ; I will render to the man according to his work . "
behold , it was all grown over with thor@@ ns . its surface was covered with net@@ tles , and its stone wall was broken down .
for it is better that it be said to you , " Come up here , " than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince , whom your eyes have seen .
as the cold of snow in the time of harvest , so is a faithful messenger to those who send him ; for he refresh@@ es the soul of his masters .
as one who takes away a garment in cold weather , or vin@@ eg@@ ar on soda , so is one who s@@ ings songs to a heavy heart .
it is better to dwell in the corner of the hous@@ et@@ op , than to share a house with a contentious woman .
like snow in summer , and as rain in harvest , so honor is not fitting for a fool .
like a fl@@ ut@@ tering spar@@ row , like a dar@@ ting swallow , so the un@@ deserved curse do@@ es@@ n '@@ t come to rest .
like one who grab@@ s a dog 's ears is one who passes by and med@@ dles in a quarrel not his own .
a stone is heavy , and sand is a burden ; but a fool 's provocation is heavier than both .
a full soul lo@@ ath@@ es a honey@@ comb ; but to a hungry soul , every bitter thing is sweet .
as a bird that w@@ and@@ ers from her nest , so is a man who w@@ and@@ ers from his home .
Don '@@ t for@@ sake your friend and your father 's friend . Don '@@ t go to your brother 's house in the day of your disaster : better is a neighbor who is near than a distant brother .
those who for@@ sake the law praise the wicked ; but those who keep the law contend with them .
whoever keeps the law is a wise son ; but he who is a companion of glut@@ tons sh@@ ames his father .
the rich man is wise in his own eyes ; but the poor who has understanding sees through him .
a tyran@@ n@@ ical ruler lacks judgment . one who h@@ ates ill @@@ -@@ @ gotten gain will have long days .
one who works his land will have an abundance of food ; but one who ch@@ ases fantasies will have his fill of poverty .
a faithful man is rich with blessings ; but one who is eager to be rich will not go un@@ punished .
remove far from me false@@ hood and lies . give me neither poverty nor riches . feed me with the food that is need@@ ful for me ;
there is a generation whose teeth are like s@@ words , and their j@@ aws like kni@@ ves , to dev@@ our the poor from the earth , and the ne@@ edy from among men .
" the le@@ ach has two daughters : ' give , give . ' " there are three things that are never satisfied ; four that don '@@ t say , ' En@@ ough : '
" if you have done fool@@ ishly in lifting up yourself , or if you have thought evil , put your hand over your mouth .
for as the chur@@ ning of milk brings forth butter , and the wr@@ inging of the nose brings forth blood ; so the forcing of wrath brings forth strife . "
she rises also while it is yet night , gives food to her household , and portions for her servant girls .
she opens her arms to the poor ; yes , she extends her hands to the ne@@ edy .
the wind goes toward the south , and turns around to the north . it turns around continually as it goes , and the wind returns again to its courses .
that which has been is that which shall be ; and that which has been done is that which shall be done : and there is no new thing under the sun .
is there a thing of which it may be said , " Be@@ hold , this is new ? " it has been long ago , in the ages which were before us .
I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky . it is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with .
that which is cro@@ oked can '@@ t be made straight ; and that which is lacking can '@@ t be counted .
I made myself gardens and parks , and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit .
I made myself pools of water , to water from it the forest where trees were re@@ ared .
for there is a man whose labor is with wisdom , with knowledge , and with skill@@ fulness ; yet he shall leave it for his portion to a man who has not lab@@ ored for it . this also is van@@ ity and a great evil .
for what has a man of all his labor , and of the striving of his heart , in which he lab@@ ors under the sun ?
there is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink , and make his soul enjoy good in his labor . this also I saw , that it is from the hand of God .
he has made everything beautiful in its time . he has also set eternity in their hearts , yet so that man can '@@ t find out the work that God has done from the beginning even to the end .
that which is has been long ago , and that which is to be has been long ago : and God seeks again that which is passed away .
moreover I saw under the sun , in the place of justice , that w@@ ick@@ edness was there ; and in the place of righteousness , that w@@ ick@@ edness was there .
who knows the spirit of man , whether it goes upward , and the spirit of the animal , whether it goes downward to the earth ? "
then I returned and saw all the op@@ pressions that are done under the sun : and behold , the tears of those who were oppressed , and they had no comfor@@ ter ; and on the side of their op@@ pres@@ sors there was power ; but they had no comfor@@ ter .
yes , better than them both is him who has not yet been , who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun .
for if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow ; but w@@ oe to him who is alone when he falls , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have another to lift him up .
for out of prison he came forth to be king ; yes , even in his kingdom he was born poor .
better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire . this also is van@@ ity and a chasing after wind .
it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of fe@@ asting : for that is the end of all men , and the living should take this to heart .
sorrow is better than laughter ; for by the sadness of the face the heart is made good .
it is good that you should take hold of this . yes , also from that don '@@ t withdraw your hand ; for he who fears God will come forth from them all .
I turned around , and my heart sought to know and to search out , and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things , and to know that w@@ ick@@ edness is stupidity , and that fool@@ is@@ hness is madness .
which my soul still seeks ; but I have not found . one man among a thousand have I found ; but I have not found a woman among all those .
who is like the wise man ? and who knows the interpretation of a thing ? a man 's wisdom makes his face shine , and the hard@@ ness of his face is changed .
whoever keeps the commandment shall not come to harm , and his wise heart will know the time and procedure .
there is no man who has power over the spirit to contain the spirit ; neither does he have power over the day of death . there is no discharge in war ; neither shall w@@ ick@@ edness deliver those who practice it .
all this have I seen , and applied my mind to every work that is done under the sun . there is a time in which one man has power over another to his hurt .
because sentence against an evil work is not executed spe@@ ed@@ ily , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil .
though a sinner commits crimes a hundred times , and lives long , yet surely I know that it will be better with those who fear God , who are rever@@ ent before him .
then I commended mir@@ th , because a man has no better thing under the sun , than to eat , and to drink , and to be joyful : for that will accompany him in his labor all the days of his life which God has given him under the sun .
for man also do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know his time . as the fish that are taken in an evil net , and as the birds that are caught in the sn@@ are , even so are the sons of men sn@@ ared in an evil time , when it falls suddenly on them .
then I said , " Wis@@ dom is better than strength . " nevertheless the poor man 's wisdom is desp@@ ised , and his words are not heard .
a wise man 's heart is at his right hand , but a fool 's heart at his left .
a feast is made for laughter , and wine makes the life glad ; and money is the answer for all things .
give a portion to seven , yes , even to eight ; for you don '@@ t know what evil will be on the earth .
if the clouds are full of rain , they empty themselves on the earth ; and if a tree falls toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree falls , there shall it be .
in the morning sow your seed , and in the evening don '@@ t with@@ hold your hand ; for you don '@@ t know which will prosper , whether this or that , or whether they both will be equally good .
in the day when the keepers of the house shall trem@@ ble , and the strong men shall bow themselves , and the gr@@ inders cease because they are few , and those who look out of the windows are dark@@ ened ,
further , because the Pre@@ acher was wise , he still taught the people knowledge . yes , he pon@@ dered , sought out , and set in order many prover@@ bs .
as the apple tree among the trees of the wood , so is my beloved among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great delight , his fruit was sweet to my taste .
my beloved is like a ro@@ e or a young hart . behold , he stands behind our wall ! he looks in at the windows . he g@@ lan@@ ces through the lat@@ tice .
my beloved spoke , and said to me , " R@@ ise up , my love , my beautiful one , and come away .
the fi@@ g tree ri@@ pens her green fi@@ gs . the v@@ ines are in blos@@ som . they give forth their fragrance . arise , my love , my beautiful one , and come away . " lover
my do@@ ve in the cle@@ fts of the rock , In the hiding places of the mountain@@ side , Let me see your face . let me hear your voice ; for your voice is sweet , and your face is lovely .
catch for us the fo@@ xes , the little fo@@ xes that spoil the vineyards ; for our vineyards are in blos@@ som . beloved
I will get up now , and go about the city ; in the streets and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves . I sought him , but I did@@ n '@@ t find him .
who is this who comes up from the wilderness like pillars of smoke , perf@@ um@@ ed with my@@ rr@@ h and frank@@ inc@@ ense , with all spices of the merchant ?
behold , it is Solomon 's carriage ! sixty mighty men are around it , of the mighty men of Israel .
they all handle the sword , and are expert in war . every man has his sword on his thi@@ gh , because of fear in the night .
go forth , you daughters of Z@@ ion , and see king Solomon , with the crown with which his mother has crowned him , in the day of his weddings , in the day of the gl@@ ad@@ ness of his heart . lover
behold , you are beautiful , my love . behold , you are beautiful . your eyes are d@@ oves behind your veil . your hair is as a flock of goats , that descend from Mount Gil@@ e@@ ad .
your teeth are like a newly shor@@ n flock , which have come up from the washing , where every one of them has twins . none is ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed among them .
until the day is cool , and the shadows flee away , I will go to the mountain of my@@ rr@@ h , to the hill of frank@@ inc@@ ense .
come with me from Lebanon , my bride , with me from Lebanon . look from the top of A@@ man@@ a , from the top of Sen@@ ir and Her@@ mon , from the lions ' dens , from the mountains of the le@@ op@@ ards .
your lips , my bride , dri@@ p like the honey@@ comb . honey and milk are under your tongue . the smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon .
I have come into my garden , my sister , my bride . I have gathered my my@@ rr@@ h with my sp@@ ice ; I have eaten my honey@@ comb with my honey ; I have drunk my wine with my milk . friends E@@ at , friends ! drink , yes , drink ab@@ und@@ antly , beloved . beloved
how is your beloved better than another beloved , you fai@@ rest among women ? how is your beloved better than another beloved , that you do so ad@@ j@@ ure us ? beloved
my beloved has gone down to his garden , to the beds of spices , to feed in the gardens , and to gather l@@ ilies .
I went down into the nut tree gro@@ ve , to see the green plants of the valley , to see whether the vine bud@@ ded , and the p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates were in flower .
I ad@@ j@@ ure you , daughters of Jerusalem , that you not stir up , nor awaken love , until it so desires . friends
who is this who comes up from the wilderness , leaning on her beloved ? under the apple tree I aroused you . there your mother conceived you . there she was in labor and bore you .
the vision of Isaiah the son of A@@ mo@@ z , which he saw concerning Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem , in the days of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , Jo@@ th@@ am , A@@ haz , and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , kings of Jud@@ ah .
why should you be beaten more , that you revolt more and more ? the whole head is sick , and the whole heart faint .
from the sole of the foot even to the head there is no sound@@ ness in it : wounds , wel@@ ts , and open so@@ res . they haven '@@ t been closed , neither band@@ aged , neither soo@@ thed with oil .
the daughter of Z@@ ion is left like a shelter in a viney@@ ard , like a hu@@ t in a field of mel@@ ons , like a be@@ sieg@@ ed city .
wash yourselves , make yourself clean . put away the evil of your do@@ ings from before my eyes . cease to do evil .
" come now , and let us reason together , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : " though your sins be as scar@@ let , they shall be as white as snow . though they be red like cri@@ m@@ son , they shall be as wool .
your princes are rebelli@@ ous , and companions of thieves . everyone loves bribes , and follows after rewards . they don '@@ t judge the fa@@ ther@@ less , neither does the cause of the widow come to them .
therefore the Lord , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , the Mi@@ ghty One of Israel , says : " Ah , I will get relief from my adversaries , and av@@ enge myself of my enemies ;
the strong will be like tin@@ der , and his work like a spark . they will both burn together , and no one will qu@@ en@@ ch them . "
he will judge between the nations , and will decide concerning many peoples ; and they shall beat their s@@ words into pl@@ ow@@ shares , and their spe@@ ars into pr@@ un@@ ing hoo@@ ks . nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
their land is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures . their land also is full of horses , neither is there any end of their ch@@ ari@@ ots .
their land also is full of idols . they worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fingers have made .
for there will be a day of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies for all that is proud and ha@@ u@@ ghty , and for all that is lifted up ; and it shall be brought low :
in that day , men shall cast away their idols of silver , and their idols of gold , which have been made for themselves to worship , to the mol@@ es and to the b@@ ats ;
for , behold , the Lord , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , takes away from Jerusalem and from Jud@@ ah supply and support , the whole supply of bread , and the whole supply of water ;
the mighty man , the man of war , the judge , the prophet , the div@@ iner , the elder ,
the captain of fifty , the honorable man , the counsel@@ or , the skilled cra@@ fts@@ man , and the clever enchan@@ ter .
the people will be oppressed , everyone by another , and everyone by his neighbor . the child will behave himself proudly against the old man , and the base against the honorable .
in that day he will cry out , saying , " I will not be a heal@@ er ; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing . you shall not make me ruler of the people . "
as for my people , children are their op@@ pres@@ sors , and women rule over them . my people , those who lead you cause you to er@@ r , and destroy the way of your paths .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will enter into judgment with the elders of his people , and their leaders : " it is you who have eaten up the viney@@ ard . the spoil of the poor is in your houses .
in that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their ank@@ lets , the head@@ bands , the c@@ rescent nec@@ kl@@ aces ,
in that day , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's branch will be beautiful and glorious , and the fruit of the land will be the beauty and glory of the survivors of Israel .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will create over the whole hab@@ itation of Mount Z@@ ion , and over her assemblies , a cloud and smoke by day , and the shining of a fl@@ aming fire by night ; for over all the glory will be a can@@ op@@ y .
let me sing for my well beloved a song of my beloved about his viney@@ ard . my beloved had a viney@@ ard on a very fruitful hill .
now I will tell you what I will do to my viney@@ ard . I will take away its hedge , and it will be eaten up . I will break down its wall of it , and it will be tram@@ pled down .
for the viney@@ ard of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies is the house of Israel , and the men of Jud@@ ah his pleasant plant : and he looked for justice , but , behold , oppression ; for righteousness , but , behold , a cry of distress .
w@@ oe to those who join house to house , who lay field to field , until there is no room , and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land !
for ten acres of viney@@ ard shall yield one bath , and a Hom@@ er of seed shall yield an ep@@ ha@@ h . "
the har@@ p , ly@@ re , t@@ amb@@ our@@ ine , and fl@@ ute , with wine , are at their fe@@ asts ; but they don '@@ t respect the work of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , neither have they considered the operation of his hands .
who say , " Let him make speed , let him ha@@ sten his work , that we may see it ; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come , that we may know it ! "
he will lift up a banner to the nations from far , and he will whistle for them from the end of the earth . behold , they will come spe@@ ed@@ ily and swiftly .
their ro@@ aring will be like a lion@@ ess . they will ro@@ ar like young lions . yes , they shall ro@@ ar , and seize their prey and carry it off , and there will be no one to deliver .
one called to another , and said , " Holy , holy , holy , is Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies ! the whole earth is full of his glory ! "
then I said , " W@@ oe is me ! for I am un@@ done , because I am a man of un@@ clean lips , and I dwell in the midst of a people of un@@ clean lips : for my eyes have seen the King , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies ! "
then one of the ser@@ ap@@ him flew to me , having a live coal in his hand , which he had taken with the t@@ ongs from off the altar .
he touched my mouth with it , and said , " Be@@ hold , this has touched your lips ; and your ini@@ qu@@ ity is taken away , and your sin forgiven . "
I heard the Lord 's voice , saying , " Who@@ m shall I send , and who will go for us ? " then I said , " Here I am . send me ! "
he said , " Go , and tell this people , ' You hear indeed , but don '@@ t understand ; and you see indeed , but don '@@ t perceive . '
make the heart of this people fat . make their ears heavy , and shut their eyes ; lest they see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and understand with their heart , and turn again , and be healed . "
it happened in the days of A@@ haz the son of Jo@@ th@@ am , the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , king of Jud@@ ah , that Re@@ zin the king of Syria , and Pe@@ k@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah , king of Israel , went up to Jerusalem to war against it , but could not prevail against it .
it was told the house of David , saying , " Syria is allied with E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im . " his heart trem@@ bled , and the heart of his people , as the trees of the forest trem@@ ble with the wind .
then Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Isaiah , " Go out now to meet A@@ haz , you , and S@@ hear@@ j@@ ash@@ u@@ b your son , at the end of the condu@@ it of the upper pool , on the highway of the ful@@ ler 's field .
tell him , ' Be careful , and keep calm . Don '@@ t be afraid , neither let your heart be faint because of these two tails of smoking tor@@ ches , for the fierce anger of Re@@ zin and Syria , and of the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah .
because Syria , E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah , have plo@@ tted evil against you , saying ,
and the head of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is Sam@@ aria , and the head of Sam@@ aria is Rem@@ ali@@ ah 's son . if you will not believe , surely you shall not be established . ' "
he said , " List@@ en now , house of David . is it not enough for you to try the patience of men , that you will try the patience of my God also ?
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will bring on you , on your people , and on your father 's house , days that have not come , from the day that E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im departed from Jud@@ ah ; even the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
it will happen in that day that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will whistle for the fly that is in the utter@@ most part of the rivers of Egypt , and for the bee that is in the land of As@@ sy@@ ria .
it shall happen in that day that a man shall keep alive a young cow , and two sheep ;
all the hills that were cultivated with the ho@@ e , you shall not come there for fear of bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns ; but it shall be for the sending forth of ox@@ en , and for the t@@ reading of sheep . "
and I will take for myself faithful witnesses to testify : Uri@@ ah the priest , and Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah the son of Je@@ ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah . "
it will sweep on@@ ward into Jud@@ ah . it will over@@ flow and pass through ; it will reach even to the neck ; and the stretching out of its wings will fill the breadth of your land , Im@@ manuel .
" Don '@@ t say , ' A conspiracy ! ' concerning all about which this people say , ' A conspiracy ! ' neither fear their threats , nor be terror@@ ized .
behold , I and the children whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , who d@@ wells in Mount Z@@ ion .
when they tell you , " Consul@@ t with those who have familiar spirits and with the w@@ izards , who ch@@ ir@@ p and who mut@@ ter : " shoul@@ d@@ n '@@ t a people consult with their God ? should they consult the dead on behalf of the living ?
turn to the law and to the testimony ! if they don '@@ t speak according to this word , surely there is no morning for them .
you have multiplied the nation . you have increased their joy . they rejoice before you according to the joy in harvest , as men rejoice when they divide the spoil .
for all the armor of the armed man in the noisy battle , and the garments rolled in blood , will be for burning , fuel for the fire .
for to us a child is born . to us a son is given ; and the government will be on his shoulders . his name will be called Won@@ der@@ ful , Coun@@ sel@@ or , Mi@@ ghty God , Ever@@ lasting Father , Prince of Peace .
all the people will know , including E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and the inhabitants of Sam@@ aria , who say in pride and in arrogance of heart ,
the Syrians in front , and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines behind ; and they will dev@@ our Israel with open mouth . for all this , his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
through the wrath of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , the land is burnt up ; and the people are the fuel for the fire . no one sp@@ ares his brother .
one will dev@@ our on the right hand , and be hungry ; and he will eat on the left hand , and they will not be satisfied . everyone will eat the flesh of his own arm :
Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , Man@@ as@@ se@@ h ; and they together shall be against Jud@@ ah . for all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
what will you do in the day of vis@@ itation , and in the des@@ ol@@ ation which will come from af@@ ar ? to whom will you flee for help ? where will you leave your wealth ?
they will only bow down under the prisoners , and will fall under the sl@@ ain . for all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
however he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t mean so , neither does his heart think so ; but it is in his heart to destroy , and to cut off not a few nations .
therefore it will happen that , when the Lord has performed his whole work on Mount Z@@ ion and on Jerusalem , I will punish the fruit of the will@@ ful proud heart of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , and the in@@ sol@@ ence of his ha@@ u@@ ghty looks .
for he has said , " By the strength of my hand I have done it , and by my wisdom ; for I have understanding : and I have removed the boundaries of the peoples , and have robbed their treasures . like a val@@ i@@ ant man I have brought down their rulers .
therefore the Lord , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , will send among his fat ones lean@@ ness ; and under his glory a burning will be kind@@ led like the burning of fire .
the light of Israel will be for a fire , and his Holy One for a flame ; and it will burn and dev@@ our his thor@@ ns and his bri@@ ers in one day .
he will consume the glory of his forest , and of his fruitful field , both soul and body . it will be as when a standard be@@ arer f@@ aints .
it will come to pass in that day that the remn@@ ant of Israel , and those who have escaped from the house of Jacob will no more again lean on him who struck them , but shall lean on Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the Holy One of Israel , in truth .
therefore the Lord , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , says " My people who dwell in Z@@ ion , don '@@ t be afraid of the As@@ sy@@ rian , though he strike you with the rod , and lift up his staff against you , as Egypt did .
for yet a very little while , and the indignation against you will be accomplished , and my anger will be directed to his destruction . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies will stir up a scourge against him , as in the slaughter of Mi@@ dian at the rock of O@@ re@@ b . his rod will be over the sea , and he will lift it up like he did against Egypt .
it will happen in that day , that his burden will depart from off your shoulder , and his y@@ oke from off your neck , and the y@@ oke shall be destroyed because of the ano@@ in@@ ting oil .
behold , the Lord , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , will lo@@ p the b@@ ough@@ s with terror . the tall will be cut down , and the lofty will be brought low .
his delight will be in the fear of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . he will not judge by the sight of his eyes , neither decide by the hearing of his ears ;
the nursing child will play near a co@@ bra 's hole , and the we@@ an@@ ed child will put his hand on the vi@@ per 's den .
they will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain ; for the earth will be full of the knowledge of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , as the waters cover the sea .
the envy also of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im will depart , and those who persec@@ ute Jud@@ ah will be cut off . E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im won '@@ t envy Jud@@ ah , and Jud@@ ah won '@@ t persec@@ ute E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
there will be a highway for the remn@@ ant that is left of his people from As@@ sy@@ ria , like there was for Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt .
in that day you will say , " Gi@@ ve thanks to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ! call on his name . declare his do@@ ings among the peoples . proclaim that his name is exalted !
I have commanded my consec@@ rated ones ; yes , I have called my mighty men for my anger , even my proudly ex@@ ul@@ ting ones .
they come from a far country , from the utter@@ most part of heaven , even Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the weapons of his indignation , to destroy the whole land .
w@@ ail ; for the day of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is at hand ! it will come as destruction from the Almighty .
behold , the day of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h comes , cruel , with wrath and fierce anger ; to make the land a des@@ ol@@ ation , and to destroy its sinners out of it .
I will punish the world for their evil , and the wicked for their ini@@ qu@@ ity . I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease , and will humble the ha@@ u@@ ght@@ iness of the terrible .
their infants also will be d@@ ashed in pieces before their eyes . their houses will be r@@ ans@@ acked , and their wives raped .
Babylon , the glory of king@@ doms , the beauty of the Chal@@ de@@ ans ' pride , will be like when God over@@ threw So@@ dom and Gom@@ or@@ rah .
it will never be inhabited , neither will it be lived in from generation to generation . the Arabian will not pitch a tent there , neither will shep@@ herds make their f@@ locks lie down there .
but wild animals of the desert will lie there , and their houses will be full of jack@@ als . O@@ stric@@ hes will dwell there , and wild goats will fro@@ lic there .
the peoples will take them , and bring them to their place . the house of Israel will possess them in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's land for servants and for hand@@ m@@ aids . they will take as cap@@ tives those whose cap@@ tives they were ; and they shall rule over their op@@ pres@@ sors .
it will happen in the day that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will give you rest from your sorrow , from your trouble , and from the hard service in which you were made to serve ,
they all will answer and ask you , " Have you also become as weak as we are ? have you become like us ? "
your pom@@ p is brought down to She@@ ol , with the sound of your str@@ ing@@ ed instruments . mag@@ go@@ ts are spread out under you , and worms cover you .
you said in your heart , " I will asc@@ end into heaven ! I will ex@@ alt my throne above the stars of God ! I will sit on the mountain of assembly , in the far north !
those who see you will stare at you . they will ponder you , saying , " Is this the man who made the earth to trem@@ ble , who shook king@@ doms ;
you will not join them in burial , because you have destroyed your land . you have killed your people . the seed of ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers will not be named forever .
" I will rise up against them , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , " and cut off from Babylon name and remn@@ ant , and son and son 's son , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
this is the plan that is determined for the whole earth . this is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations .
for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies has planned , and who can stop it ? his hand is stretched out , and who can turn it back ? "
Don '@@ t rejoice , O Phil@@ is@@ tia , all of you , because the rod that struck you is broken ; for out of the ser@@ pent 's root an adder will emerge , and his fruit will be a fiery flying ser@@ pent .
the fir@@ st@@ born of the poor will eat , and the ne@@ edy will lie down in safety ; and I will kill your root with famine , and your remn@@ ant will be killed .
how@@ l , gate ! cry , city ! you are melted away , Phil@@ is@@ tia , all of you ; for smoke comes out of the north , and there is no str@@ ag@@ gl@@ er in his ranks .
the burden of Mo@@ ab : for in a night , A@@ r of Mo@@ ab is laid waste , and brought to nothing ; for in a night K@@ ir of Mo@@ ab is laid waste , and brought to nothing .
they have gone up to Bay@@ ith , and to Di@@ bon , to the high places , to we@@ ep . Mo@@ ab w@@ ails over Ne@@ bo and over Me@@ deb@@ a . bal@@ dness is on all of their heads . every beard is cut off .
for the waters of Dim@@ on are full of blood ; for I will bring yet more on Dim@@ on , a lion on those of Mo@@ ab who escape , and on the remn@@ ant of the land .
give counsel ! execute justice ! make your shade like the night in the midst of the no@@ on@@ day ! hide the out@@ casts ! Don '@@ t betray the fu@@ gi@@ tive !
a throne will be established in loving kindness . one will sit on it in truth , in the tent of David , judging , seeking justice , and swift to do righteousness .
we have heard of the pride of Mo@@ ab , that he is very proud ; even of his arrogance , his pride , and his wrath . his bo@@ ast@@ ings are nothing .
for the fields of H@@ esh@@ bon langu@@ ish with the vine of Sib@@ ma@@ h . the lords of the nations have broken down its choice branches , which reached even to J@@ az@@ er , which wan@@ dered into the wilderness . its shoots were spread abroad . they passed over the sea .
it will happen that when Mo@@ ab presents himself , when he wear@@ ies himself on the high place , and comes to his sanctuary to pray , that he will not prevail .
the burden of Damascus : " behold , Damascus is taken away from being a city , and it will be a ru@@ inous heap .
the fortress shall cease from E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and the kingdom from Damascus , and the remn@@ ant of Syria . they will be as the glory of the children of Israel , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies .
it will be like when the har@@ vest@@ er g@@ athers the wheat , and his arm re@@ aps the grain . yes , it will be like when one g@@ leans grain in the valley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
yet g@@ lean@@ ings will be left there , like the shaking of an olive tree , two or three oli@@ ves in the top of the up@@ per@@ most b@@ ough , four or five in the ou@@ ter@@ most branches of a fruitful tree , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel .
in that day , their strong cities will be like the for@@ s@@ aken places in the woods and on the mountain top , which were for@@ s@@ aken from before the children of Israel ; and it will be a des@@ ol@@ ation .
in the day of your planting , you hedge it in . in the morning , you make your seed blos@@ som , but the harvest fle@@ es away in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow .
Ah , the upro@@ ar of many peoples , who ro@@ ar like the ro@@ aring of the seas ; and the rushing of nations , that rush like the rushing of mighty waters !
the nations will rush like the rushing of many waters : but he will rebu@@ ke them , and they will flee far off , and will be ch@@ ased like the cha@@ ff of the mountains before the wind , and like the whir@@ ling dust before the storm .
all you inhabitants of the world , and you dwellers on the earth , when a banner is lifted up on the mountains , look ! when the trum@@ pet is blown , listen !
for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to me , " I will be still , and I will see in my dwelling place , like clear heat in sunshine , like a cloud of de@@ w in the heat of harvest . "
the burden of Egypt : " behold , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h rides on a swift cloud , and comes to Egypt . the idols of Egypt will trem@@ ble at his presence ; and the heart of Egypt will melt in its midst .
I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians , and they will fight everyone against his brother , and everyone against his neighbor ; city against city , and kingdom against kingdom .
the spirit of Egypt will fail in its midst . I will destroy its counsel . they will seek the idols , the char@@ mers , those who have familiar spirits , and the w@@ izards .
I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord . a fierce king will rule over them , " says the Lord , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has mixed a spirit of per@@ vers@@ eness in the midst of her ; and they have caused Egypt to go astr@@ ay in all of its works , like a drun@@ ken man stagg@@ ers in his vom@@ it .
in that day the Egyptians will be like women . they will trem@@ ble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , which he sha@@ kes over them .
it will be for a sign and for a witness to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies in the land of Egypt ; for they will cry to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h because of op@@ pres@@ sors , and he will send them a s@@ avi@@ or and a defender , and he will deliver them .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will be known to Egypt , and the Egyptians will know Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in that day . yes , they will worship with sacrifice and offering , and will vo@@ w a vo@@ w to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and will perform it .
at that time Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke by Isaiah the son of A@@ mo@@ z , saying , " Go , and lo@@ osen the s@@ ack@@ cloth from off your waist , and take your shoes from off your feet . " he did so , walking naked and b@@ are@@ foot .
so the king of As@@ sy@@ ria will lead away the cap@@ tives of Egypt and the ex@@ iles of Ethiopia , young and old , naked and b@@ are@@ foot , and with but@@ to@@ cks uncovered , to the shame of Egypt .
the burden of the wilderness of the sea . as whir@@ l@@ winds in the South sweep through , it comes from the wilderness , from an awesome land .
a griev@@ ous vision is declared to me . the treach@@ erous man deals treach@@ er@@ ously , and the destro@@ yer destroys . go up , EL@@ AM ; attack ! I have stopped all of Media 's sigh@@ ing .
behold , here comes a troop of men , hor@@ sem@@ en in pairs . " he answered , " F@@ all@@ en , fallen is Babylon ; and all the engra@@ ved images of her gods are broken to the ground .
you are my thresh@@ ing , and the grain of my floor ! " that which I have heard from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , the God of Israel , I have declared to you .
the burden of Dum@@ ah . one calls to me out of Se@@ ir , " Wat@@ ch@@ man , what of the night ? watch@@ man , what of the night ? "
the watch@@ man said , " The morning comes , and also the night . if you will inqu@@ ire , inqu@@ ire . come back again . "
the burden on Arabia . in the forest in Arabia you will lodge , you car@@ av@@ ans of D@@ ed@@ an@@ ites .
for they fled away from the s@@ words , from the drawn sword , from the bent bow , and from the heat of battle .
the burden of the valley of vision . what ails you now , that you have all gone up to the hous@@ et@@ ops ?
all your rulers fled away together . they were bound by the arch@@ ers . all who were found by you were bound together . they fled far away .
therefore I said , " Look away from me . I will we@@ ep bit@@ terly . Don '@@ t labor to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people .
it happened that your cho@@ ic@@ est valleys were full of ch@@ ari@@ ots , and the hor@@ sem@@ en set themselves in array at the gate .
you saw the breaches of the city of David , that they were many ; and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool .
in that day , the Lord , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , called to we@@ eping , and to mourning , and to bal@@ dness , and to dressing in s@@ ack@@ cloth :
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies revealed himself in my ears , " Su@@ rely this ini@@ qu@@ ity will not be forgiven you until you die , " says the Lord , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies .
thus says the Lord , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , " Go , get yourself to this treas@@ u@@ rer , even to She@@ b@@ na , who is over the house , and say ,
'@@ What are you doing here ? who has you here , that you have dug out a tomb here ? ' cutting himself out a tomb on high , ch@@ is@@ eling a hab@@ itation for himself in the rock ! "
he will surely wind you around and around , and throw you like a ball into a large country . there you will die , and there the ch@@ ari@@ ots of your glory will be , you shame of your lord 's house .
and I will clo@@ the him with your robe , and strengthen him with your belt . I will commit your government into his hand ; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and to the house of Jud@@ ah .
I will fast@@ en him like a nail in a sure place . he will be for a throne of glory to his father 's house .
they will hang on him all the glory of his father 's house , the offspring and the issue , every small vessel , from the cups even to all the p@@ itch@@ ers .
" in that day , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , " the nail that was fast@@ ened in a sure place will give way . it will be cut down , and fall . the burden that was on it will be cut off , for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken it . "
the burden of Ty@@ re . how@@ l , you ships of Tar@@ sh@@ ish ! for it is laid waste , so that there is no house , no entering in . from the land of Kit@@ tim it is revealed to them .
on great waters , the seed of the Shi@@ h@@ or , the harvest of the Nile , was her revenue . she was the market of nations .
be ashamed , Sid@@ on ; for the sea has spoken , the strongh@@ old of the sea , saying , " I have not tr@@ avail@@ ed , nor brought forth , neither have I nourished young men , nor brought up vir@@ gins . "
who has planned this against Ty@@ re , the gi@@ ver of crow@@ ns , whose merchants are princes , whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth ?
he has stretched out his hand over the sea . he has shaken the king@@ doms . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has ordered the destruction of Can@@ a@@ an 's strongh@@ olds .
behold , the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans . this people was not . the As@@ sy@@ rians founded it for those who dwell in the wilderness . they set up their towers . they over@@ threw its palaces . they made it a ruin .
it will come to pass in that day that Ty@@ re will be forgotten seventy years , according to the days of one king . after the end of seventy years it will be to Ty@@ re like in the song of the pro@@ stitute .
take a har@@ p ; go about the city , you pro@@ stitute that has been forgotten . make sweet melody . sing many songs , that you may be remembered .
it will happen after the end of seventy years that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will visit Ty@@ re , and she shall return to her wages , and will play the pro@@ stitute with all the king@@ doms of the world on the surface of the earth .
the earth also is polluted under its inhabitants , because they have trans@@ g@@ ressed the laws , violated the statutes , and broken the everlasting covenant .
therefore the curse has dev@@ oured the earth , and those who dwell therein are found guilty . therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned , and few men left .
these shall lift up their voice . they will shout for the maj@@ esty of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . they cry aloud from the sea .
the earth will stag@@ ger like a drun@@ ken man , and will sway back and forth like a ham@@ mo@@ ck . its disobedience will be heavy on it , and it will fall and not rise again .
they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the pit , and shall be shut up in the prison ; and after many days shall they be visited .
then the moon shall be conf@@ ounded , and the sun ashamed ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies will reign on Mount Z@@ ion , and in Jerusalem ; and before his elders will be glory .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , you are my God . I will ex@@ alt you ! I will praise your name , for you have done wonderful things , things planned long ago , in complete faith@@ fulness and truth .
for you have made a city into a heap , a fortified city into a ruin , a palace of strangers to be no city . it will never be built .
in this mountain , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies will make all peoples a feast of fat things , a feast of choice wines , of fat things full of marrow , of well refined choice wines .
he will destroy in this mountain the surface of the covering that covers all peoples , and the veil that is spread over all nations .
he has swallowed up death forever ! the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will wipe away tears from off all faces . he will take the repro@@ ach of his people away from off all the earth , for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken it .
it shall be said in that day , " Be@@ hold , this is our God ! we have waited for him , and he will save us ! this is Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ! we have waited for him . we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation ! "
he will spread out his hands in its midst , like one who swim@@ s spreads out hands to swim , but his pride will be hum@@ bled together with the craft of his hands .
in that day , this song will be sung in the land of Jud@@ ah : " we have a strong city . God ap@@ points salvation for walls and bul@@ war@@ ks .
let favor be shown to the wicked , yet he will not learn righteousness . in the land of upri@@ ghtness he will deal wrong@@ fully , and will not see Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's maj@@ esty .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , your hand is lifted up , yet they don '@@ t see ; but they will see your zeal for the people , and be disappointed . yes , fire will consume your adversaries .
the dead shall not live . the deceased shall not rise . therefore have you visited and destroyed them , and caused all memory of them to perish .
your dead shall live . my dead bodies shall arise . awake and sing , you who dwell in the dust ; for your de@@ w is like the de@@ w of herbs , and the earth will cast forth the dead .
for , behold , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h comes forth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their ini@@ qu@@ ity . the earth also will disclose her blood , and will no longer cover her sl@@ ain .
in that day , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h with his hard and great and strong sword will punish lev@@ i@@ athan , the fleeing ser@@ pent , and lev@@ i@@ athan the twisted ser@@ pent ; and he will kill the dragon that is in the sea .
or else let him take hold of my strength , that he may make peace with me . let him make peace with me . "
in measure , when you send them away , you contend with them . he has removed them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind .
for the fortified city is solitary , a hab@@ itation deserted and for@@ s@@ aken , like the wilderness . the cal@@ f will feed there , and there he will lie down , and consume its branches .
it will happen in that day , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will th@@ resh from the flowing stream of the E@@ uph@@ rates to the bro@@ ok of Egypt ; and you will be gathered one by one , children of Israel .
behold , the Lord has a mighty and strong one . like a storm of hail , a destroying storm , and like a storm of mighty waters over@@ flowing , he will cast them down to the earth with his hand .
to whom he said , " This is the resting place . give rest to weary " ; and " This is the refreshing " ; yet they would not hear .
therefore thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " Be@@ hold , I lay in Z@@ ion for a foundation a stone , a tried stone , a precious cornerstone of a sure foundation . he who believes shall not act hastily .
your covenant with death shall be ann@@ ul@@ led , and your agreement with She@@ ol shall not stand . when the over@@ flowing scourge passes through , then you will be tram@@ pled down by it .
for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will rise up as on Mount Per@@ az@@ im . he will be angry as in the valley of Gi@@ be@@ on ; that he may do his work , his unusual work , and bring to pass his act , his extraordinary act .
now therefore don '@@ t be s@@ coff@@ ers , lest your bonds be made strong ; for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , on the whole earth .
bread flour must be ground ; so he will not always be thresh@@ ing it . although he drives the wheel of his thresh@@ ing cart over it , his horses don '@@ t gr@@ ind it .
but the multitude of your fo@@ es will be like fine dust , and the multitude of the ruthless ones like cha@@ ff that blows away . yes , it will be in an instant , suddenly .
the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ari@@ el , even all who fight against her and her strongh@@ old , and who distress her , will be like a dream , a vision of the night .
is@@ n '@@ t it yet a very little while , and Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field , and the fruitful field will be regarded as a forest ?
for the ruthless is brought to nothing , and the s@@ coff@@ er c@@ eases , and all those who are alert to do evil are cut off@@ --
" w@@ oe to the rebelli@@ ous children , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " who take counsel , but not from me ; and who make an alliance , but not with my Spirit , that they may add sin to sin ,
who tell the se@@ ers , " Don '@@ t see ! " and to the prophets , " Don '@@ t proph@@ esy to us right things . tell us pleasant things . proph@@ esy dece@@ its .
but you said , " No , for we will flee on horses " ; therefore you will flee ; and , " We will ride on the swift " ; therefore those who pursue you will be swift .
therefore Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will wait , that he may be gr@@ acious to you ; and therefore he will be exalted , that he may have mercy on you , for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is a God of justice . blessed are all those who wait for him .
for the people will dwell in Z@@ ion at Jerusalem . you will we@@ ep no more . he will surely be gr@@ acious to you at the voice of your cry . when he hears you , he will answer you .
you shall def@@ ile the over@@ laying of your engra@@ ved images of silver , and the pl@@ ating of your mol@@ ten images of gold . you shall cast them away as an un@@ clean thing . you shall tell it , " Go away ! "
he will give the rain for your seed , with which you will sow the ground ; and bread of the increase of the ground will be rich and plentiful . in that day , your livestock will feed in large past@@ ures .
behold , the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h comes from far away , burning with his anger , and in thick rising smoke . his lips are full of indignation , and his tongue is as a dev@@ ouring fire .
his breath is as an over@@ flowing stream that reaches even to the neck , to si@@ ft the nations with the si@@ eve of destruction ; and a bri@@ dle that leads to ruin will be in the j@@ aws of the peoples .
you will have a song , as in the night when a holy feast is kept ; and gl@@ ad@@ ness of heart , as when one goes with a fl@@ ute to come to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's mountain , to Israel 's Rock .
every stroke of the rod of punishment , which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will lay on him , will be with the sound of t@@ amb@@ our@@ ines and har@@ ps . he will fight with them in battles , bran@@ dis@@ hing weapons .
for his burning place has long been ready . yes , for the king it is prepared . he has made its py@@ re deep and large with fire and much wood . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's breath , like a stream of sulfur , kind@@ les it .
now the Egyptians are men , and not God ; and their horses flesh , and not spirit . when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h stretches out his hand , both he who helps shall stum@@ ble , and he who is helped shall fall , and they all shall be consumed together .
as birds ho@@ vering , so Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies will protect Jerusalem . he will protect and deliver it . he will pass over and preserve it . "
his rock will pass away by reason of terror , and his princes will be afraid of the banner , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , whose fire is in Z@@ ion , and his furnace in Jerusalem .
a man shall be as a hiding place from the wind , and a covert from the storm , as streams of water in a dry place , as the shade of a large rock in a weary land .
rise up , you women who are at ease ! hear my voice ! you ca@@ reless daughters , give ear to my speech !
for the palace will be for@@ s@@ aken . the populous city will be deserted . the hill and the watch@@ tower will be for dens forever , a delight for wild don@@ keys , a past@@ ure of f@@ locks ;
until the Spirit is poured on us from on high , and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field , and the fruitful field is considered a forest .
there will be stability in your times , abundance of salvation , wisdom , and knowledge . the fear of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is your treasure .
the highways are des@@ ol@@ ate . the traveling man c@@ eases . the covenant is broken . he has desp@@ ised the cities . he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t respect man .
hear , you who are far off , what I have done ; and , you who are near , acknowledge my might . "
he will dwell on high . his place of defense will be the fortress of rocks . his bread will be supplied . his waters will be sure .
your heart will meditate on the terror . where is he who counted ? where is he who weighed ? where is he who counted the towers ?
look at Z@@ ion , the city of our appointed festivals . your eyes will see Jerusalem , a quiet hab@@ itation , a tent that won '@@ t be removed . its stakes will never be pl@@ ucked up , nor will any of its cor@@ ds be broken .
but there Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will be with us in maj@@ esty , a place of broad rivers and streams , in which no gal@@ ley with o@@ ars will go , neither will any gall@@ ant ship pass by there .
your ri@@ gging is unti@@ ed . they cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t strengthen the foot of their m@@ ast . they cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t spread the sail . then the prey of a great spoil was divided . the lame took the prey .
come near , you nations , to hear ! listen , you peoples . let the earth and all it contains hear ; the world , and everything that comes from it .
their sl@@ ain will also be cast out , and the sten@@ ch of their dead bodies will come up ; and the mountains will melt in their blood .
all of the army of the sky will be dissolved . the sky will be rolled up like a scroll , and all its armies will fade away , as a leaf f@@ ades from off a vine or a fi@@ g tree .
for my sword has drunk its fill in the sky . behold , it will come down on E@@ dom , and on the people of my curse , for judgment .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's sword is filled with blood . it is covered with fat , with the blood of lam@@ bs and goats , with the fat of the kidneys of r@@ ams ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has a sacrifice in Bo@@ z@@ rah , And a great slaughter in the land of E@@ dom .
thor@@ ns will come up in its palaces , net@@ tles and th@@ ist@@ les in its fort@@ resses ; and it will be a hab@@ itation of jack@@ als , a court for o@@ stric@@ hes .
the arrow snake will make her nest there , and lay , hat@@ ch , and gather under her shade . yes , the k@@ ites will be gathered there , every one with her mate .
it will blos@@ som ab@@ und@@ antly , and rejoice even with joy and singing . Lebanon 's glory Lebanon will be given to it , the excellence of Car@@ me@@ l and Sharon . they will see Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's glory , the excellence of our God .
tell those who have a fearful heart , " Be strong . Don '@@ t be afraid . behold , your God will come with vengeance , God 's re@@ tribution . he will come and save you .
then the lame man will leap like a deer , and the tongue of the mute will sing ; for waters will break out in the wilderness , and streams in the desert .
no lion will be there , nor will any ra@@ ven@@ ous animal go up on it . they will not be found there ; but the re@@ deemed will walk there .
the Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's r@@ ans@@ omed ones will return , and come with singing to Z@@ ion ; and everlasting joy will be on their heads . they will obtain gl@@ ad@@ ness and joy , and sorrow and sigh@@ ing will flee away . "
now it happened in the four@@ teenth year of king He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , that Sen@@ n@@ ach@@ eri@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ria attacked all of the fortified cities of Jud@@ ah , and captured them .
the king of As@@ sy@@ ria sent Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h from L@@ ach@@ ish to Jerusalem to king He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah with a large army . he stood by the aqu@@ educ@@ t from the upper pool in the ful@@ ler 's field highway .
then Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of Hil@@ ki@@ ah , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the scri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah , the son of As@@ ap@@ h , the recorder came out to him .
Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h said to them , " Now tell He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , ' Th@@ us says the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , " What confidence is this in which you trust ?
behold , you trust in the staff of this bru@@ ised re@@ ed , even in Egypt , which if a man leans on it , it will go into his hand and pi@@ erce it . so is Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him .
but if you tell me , ' We trust in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God , ' is@@ n '@@ t that he whose high places and whose al@@ t@@ ars He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah has taken away , and has said to Jud@@ ah and to Jerusalem , ' You shall worship before this altar ? ' "
now therefore , please make a pledge to my master the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , and I will give you two thousand horses , if you are able on your part to set riders on them .
how then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put your trust on Egypt for ch@@ ari@@ ots and for hor@@ sem@@ en ?
have I come up now without Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h against this land to destroy it ? Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to me , " Go up against this land , and destroy it . " ' "
then Eli@@ ak@@ im , She@@ b@@ na and Jo@@ ah said to Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h , " Please speak to your servants in Ar@@ am@@ aic , for we understand it ; and don '@@ t speak to us in the Jews ' language in the hearing of the people who are on the wall . "
then Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h stood , and called out with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and said , " He@@ ar the words of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ria !
thus says the king , ' Don '@@ t let He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah deceive you ; for he will not be able to deliver you .
Don '@@ t let He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah make you trust in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , saying , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will surely deliver us . this city won '@@ t be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria . " '
Don '@@ t listen to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , for thus says the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , ' Make your peace with me , and come out to me ; and each of you eat from his vine , and each one from his fi@@ g tree , and each one of you drink the waters of his own ci@@ stern ;
beware lest He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah persuade you , saying , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will deliver us . " have any of the gods of the nations delivered their lands from the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria ?
where are the gods of Ham@@ ath and Ar@@ pad ? where are the gods of Sep@@ harv@@ aim ? have they delivered Sam@@ aria from my hand ?
who are they among all the gods of these countries that have delivered their country out of my hand , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand ? ' "
then Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of Hil@@ ki@@ ah , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the scri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah , the son of As@@ ap@@ h , the recorder , came to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah with their clothes torn , and told him the words of Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h .
it happened , when king He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah heard it , that he t@@ ore his clothes , covered himself with s@@ ack@@ cloth , and went into Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's house .
he sent Eli@@ ak@@ im , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the scri@@ be , and the elders of the priests , covered with s@@ ack@@ cloth , to Isaiah the prophet , the son of A@@ mo@@ z .
Isaiah said to them , " Tell your master , ' Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " Don '@@ t be afraid of the words that you have heard , with which the servants of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria have bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed me .
behold , I will put a spirit in him and he will hear news , and will return to his own land . I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land . " ' "
" thus you shall speak to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , saying , ' Don '@@ t let your God in whom you trust deceive you , saying , " Jerusalem won '@@ t be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria . "
and have cast their gods into the fire ; for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone ; therefore they have destroyed them .
this is the word which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken concerning him . the virgin daughter of Z@@ ion has desp@@ ised you and ridicul@@ ed you . the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you .
whom have you de@@ fied and bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed ? against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high ? against the Holy One of Israel .
I have dug and drunk water , and with the sole of my feet I will dry up all the rivers of Egypt . "
have you not heard how I have done it long ago , and formed it in ancient times ? now I have brought it to pass , that it should be yours to destroy fortified cities , turning them into ru@@ inous he@@ aps .
therefore their inhabitants had little power . they were dis@@ may@@ ed and conf@@ ounded . they were like the grass of the field , and like the green her@@ b , like the grass on the hous@@ et@@ ops , and like a field before its crop has grown .
therefore thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h concerning the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , ' He will not come to this city , nor shoot an arrow there , neither will he come before it with shield , nor cast up a m@@ ound against it .
'@@ For I will defend this city to save it , for my own sake , and for my servant David 's sake . ' "
the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h went out and struck one hundred and eighty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand men in the camp of the As@@ sy@@ rians . when men arose early in the morning , behold , these were all dead bodies .
in those days was He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah sick and near death . Isaiah the prophet , the son of A@@ mo@@ z , came to him , and said to him , " Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' Set your house in order , for you will die , and not live . ' "
and said , " Rem@@ ember now , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , I beg you , how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in your sight . " He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah we@@ pt bit@@ terly .
" go , and tell He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , ' Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of David your father , " I have heard your prayer . I have seen your tears . behold , I will add fifteen years to your life .
the writing of He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , when he had been sick , and had recovered of his sickness .
I said , " In the middle of my life I go into the gates of She@@ ol . I am deprived of the resi@@ due of my years . "
I said , " I won '@@ t see Y@@ ah , Y@@ ah in the land of the living . I will see man no more with the inhabitants of the world .
what will I say ? he has both spoken to me , and himself has done it . I will walk carefully all my years because of the angu@@ ish of my soul .
Lord , men live by these things ; and my spirit finds life in all of them : you restore me , and cause me to live .
behold , for peace I had great angu@@ ish , but you have in love for my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption ; for you have cast all my sins behind your back .
for She@@ ol can '@@ t praise you . death can '@@ t celebrate you . those who go down into the pit can '@@ t hope for your truth .
He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah also had said , " What is the sign that I will go up to the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ? "
at that time , Mer@@ od@@ ach Bal@@ adan the son of Bal@@ adan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah ; for he heard that he had been sick , and had recovered .
then Isaiah the prophet came to king He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , and asked him , " What did these men say ? where did they come from to you ? " He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah said , " They have come from a country far from me , even from Babylon . "
'@@ Be@@ hold , the days are coming when all that is in your house , and that which your fathers have stored up until this day , will be carried to Babylon . nothing will be left , ' says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
'@@ They will take away your sons who will issue from you , whom you shall father , and they will be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s in the king of Babylon 's palace . ' "
then He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah said to Isaiah , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's word which you have spoken is good . " he said moreover , " For there will be peace and truth in my days . "
" speak comfortably to Jerusalem ; and call out to her that her warfare is accomplished , that her ini@@ qu@@ ity is par@@ d@@ oned , that she has received of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's hand double for all her sins . "
every valley shall be exalted , and every mountain and hill shall be made low . the uneven shall be made level , and the rough places a plain .
the glory of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall be revealed , and all flesh shall see it together ; for the mouth of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken it . "
the voice of one saying , " C@@ ry ! " one said , " What shall I cry ? " " all flesh is like grass , and all its glory is like the flower of the field .
behold , the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will come as a mighty one , and his arm will rule for him . behold , his reward is with him , and his re@@ comp@@ ense before him .
who did he take counsel with , and who instructed him , and taught him in the path of justice , and taught him knowledge , and showed him the way of understanding ?
he who is too impoverished for such an offering chooses a tree that will not rot . he seeks a skillful work@@ man to set up an engra@@ ved image for him that will not be moved .
haven '@@ t you known ? haven '@@ t you heard , yet ? haven '@@ t you been told from the beginning ? haven '@@ t you understood from the foundations of the earth ?
they are planted scarcely . they are s@@ own scarcely . their stock has scarcely taken root in the ground . he merely blows on them , and they wi@@ ther , and the whir@@ l@@ wind takes them away as stub@@ ble .
haven '@@ t you known ? haven '@@ t you heard ? the everlasting God , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , The Creator of the ends of the earth , do@@ es@@ n '@@ t faint . he is@@ n '@@ t weary . his understanding is un@@ search@@ able .
but those who wait for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will renew their strength . they will mount up with wings like eag@@ les . they will run , and not be weary . they will walk , and not faint .
" keep silent before me , islands , and let the peoples renew their strength . let them come near , then let them speak . let 's meet together for judgment .
he pursues them , and passes by safely , Even by a way that he had not gone with his feet .
the islands have seen , and fear . the ends of the earth trem@@ ble . they approach , and come .
you whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth , and called from its corners , and said to you , ' You are my servant , I have chosen you and not cast you away ; '
behold , all those who are incen@@ sed against you will be disappointed and conf@@ ounded . those who strive with you will be like nothing , and shall perish .
behold , I have made you into a new sharp thresh@@ ing instrument with teeth . you will th@@ resh the mountains , and beat them small , and will make the hills like cha@@ ff .
you will win@@ now them , and the wind will carry them away , and the whir@@ l@@ wind will sc@@ atter them . you will rejoice in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . you will glory in the Holy One of Israel .
the poor and ne@@ edy seek water , and there is none . their tongue fails for thirst . I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , will answer them . I , the God of Israel , will not for@@ sake them .
that they may see , know , consider , and understand together , that the hand of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has done this , and the Holy One of Israel has created it .
produce your cause , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . " bring forth your strong reasons , " says the King of Jacob .
" I have raised up one from the north , and he has come ; from the rising of the sun , one who calls on my name ; and he shall come on rulers as on mortar , and as the pot@@ ter t@@ reads clay .
he won '@@ t break a bru@@ ised re@@ ed . he won '@@ t qu@@ en@@ ch a dim@@ ly burning wick . he will faithfully bring justice .
he will not fail nor be discouraged , until he has set justice in the earth , and the islands will wait for his law . "
" I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have called you in righteousness , and will hold your hand , and will keep you , and make you a covenant for the people , as a light for the nations ;
" I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . that is my name . I will not give my glory to another , nor my praise to engra@@ ved images .
sing to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h a new song , and his praise from the end of the earth , you who go down to the sea , and all that is therein , the islands and their inhabitants .
let the wilderness and its cities raise their voices , with the villages that K@@ edar inhab@@ its . let the inhabitants of S@@ ela sing . let them shout from the top of the mountains !
I will destroy mountains and hills , and dry up all their herbs . I will make the rivers islands , and will dry up the pools .
who is blind , but my servant ? or who is as deaf as my messenger whom I send ? who is as blind as he who is at peace , and as blind as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's servant ?
but this is a robbed and pl@@ under@@ ed people . all of them are sn@@ ared in holes , and they are hidden in prisons . they have become a prey , and no one delivers ; and a spoil , and no one says , ' Restore them ! '
who gave Jacob as pl@@ under , and Israel to the rob@@ bers ? did@@ n '@@ t Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , he against whom we have sin@@ ned ? for they would not walk in his ways , and they dis@@ obeyed his law .
but now thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h who created you , Jacob , and he who formed you , Israel : " Don '@@ t be afraid , for I have re@@ deemed you . I have called you by your name . you are mine .
when you pass through the waters , I will be with you ; and through the rivers , they will not over@@ flow you . when you walk through the fire , you will not be burned , and flame will not scor@@ ch you .
Don '@@ t be afraid ; for I am with you . I will bring your seed from the east , and gather you from the west .
" you are my witnesses , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " With my servant whom I have chosen ; that you may know and believe me , and understand that I am he . before me there was no God formed , neither will there be after me .
I have declared , I have saved , and I have shown ; and there was no strange god among you . therefore you are my witnesses , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " and I am God .
behold , I will do a new thing . it springs forth now . Don '@@ t you know it ? I will even make a way in the wilderness , and rivers in the desert .
the animals of the field shall honor me , the jack@@ als and the o@@ stric@@ hes ; because I give water in the wilderness and rivers in the desert , to give drink to my people , my chosen ,
you have not brought me of your sheep for burnt offerings ; neither have you honored me with your sacrifices . I have not burdened you with offerings , nor wear@@ ied you with frank@@ inc@@ ense .
you have bought me no sweet cane with money , nor have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices ; but you have burdened me with your sins . you have wear@@ ied me with your ini@@ qu@@ ities .
this is what Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h who made you , and formed you from the womb , who will help you says : " Don '@@ t be afraid , Jacob my servant ; and you , Jes@@ hur@@ un , whom I have chosen .
for I will pour water on him who is thir@@ sty , and streams on the dry ground . I will pour my Spirit on your seed , and my blessing on your offspring :
one will say , ' I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's ; ' and another will be called by the name of Jacob ; and another will write with his hand ' to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' and honor the name of Israel . "
who is like me ? who will call , and will declare it , and set it in order for me , since I established the ancient people ? let them declare the things that are coming , and that will happen .
Don '@@ t fear , neither be afraid . haven '@@ t I declared it to you long ago , and shown it ? you are my witnesses . is there a God besides me ? indeed , there is not . I don '@@ t know any other Rock . "
behold , all his fellows will be disappointed ; and the work@@ men are mere men . let them all be gathered together . let them stand up . they will fear . they will be put to shame together .
he burns part of it in the fire . with part of it , he eats meat . he ro@@ asts a ro@@ ast , and is satisfied . yes , he war@@ ms himself , and says , " A@@ ha ! I am warm . I have seen the fire . "
the rest of it he makes into a god , even his engra@@ ved image . he b@@ ows down to it and wor@@ ships , and pra@@ ys to it , and says , " Deli@@ ver me ; for you are my god ! "
they don '@@ t know , neither do they consider : for he has shut their eyes , that they can '@@ t see ; and their hearts , that they can '@@ t understand .
remember these things , Jacob and Israel ; for you are my servant . I have formed you . you are my servant . Israel , you will not be forgotten by me .
I have blo@@ tted out , as a thick cloud , your trans@@ gres@@ sions , and , as a cloud , your sins . return to me , for I have re@@ deemed you .
sing , you heavens , for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has done it ! shout , you lower parts of the earth ! break out into singing , you mountains , O forest , all of your trees , for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has re@@ deemed Jacob , and will glori@@ fy himself in Israel .
who frustr@@ ates the signs of the li@@ ars , and makes div@@ in@@ ers mad ; who turns wise men backward , and makes their knowledge foolish ;
who says to the deep , ' Be dry , ' and ' I will dry up your rivers ; '
who says of Cy@@ rus , ' He is my shepherd , and shall perform all my pleasure , ' even saying of Jerusalem , ' She will be built ; ' and of the temple , ' Your foundation will be laid . ' "
I will give you the treasures of darkness , and hidden riches of secret places , that you may know that it is I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , who call you by your name , even the God of Israel .
I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and there is none else . besides me , there is no God . I will strengthen you , though you have not known me ;
I form the light , and create darkness . I make peace , and create calamity . I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , who does all these things .
Dis@@ til , you heavens , from above , and let the skies pour down righteousness . let the earth open , that it may bring forth salvation , and let it cause righteousness to spring up with it . I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have created it .
w@@ oe to him who says to a father , ' What have you become the father of ? ' or to a mother , ' To what have you given birth ? ' "
I have made the earth , and created man on it . I , even my hands , have stretched out the heavens ; and I have commanded all their army .
I have raised him up in righteousness , and I will make straight all his ways . he shall build my city , and he shall let my ex@@ iles go free , not for price nor reward , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies .
they will be disappointed , yes , conf@@ ounded , all of them . those who are makers of idols will go into confusion together .
I have not spoken in secret , in a place of the land of darkness . I did@@ n '@@ t say to the seed of Jacob , ' Se@@ ek me in vain . ' I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , speak righteousness . I declare things that are right .
" look to me , and be saved , all the ends of the earth ; for I am God , and there is no other .
they st@@ oop , they bow down together ; they could not deliver the burden , but themselves have gone into cap@@ tivity .
and even to old age I am he , and even to gray ha@@ irs will I carry you . I have made , and I will bear ; yes , I will carry , and will deliver .
some pour out gold from the bag , and weigh silver in the balance . they hire a g@@ old@@ sm@@ ith , and he makes it a god . they fall down@@ -@@ -@@ yes , they worship .
remember the former things of old : for I am God , and there is none else ; I am God , and there is none like me ;
calling a ra@@ ven@@ ous bird from the east , the man of my counsel from a far country ; yes , I have spoken , I will also bring it to pass ; I have pur@@ posed , I will also do it .
I bring near my righteousness , it shall not be far off , and my salvation shall not wait ; and I will place salvation in Z@@ ion for Israel my glory .
" come down , and sit in the dust , virgin daughter of Babylon ; sit on the ground without a throne , daughter of the Chal@@ de@@ ans : for you shall no more be called tender and delicate .
take the mil@@ l@@ stones , and gr@@ ind meal ; remove your veil , strip off the train , un@@ cover the leg , pass through the rivers .
your n@@ ak@@ edness shall be uncovered , yes , your shame shall be seen : I will take vengeance , and will spare no man . "
" sit in silence , and go into darkness , daughter of the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; for you shall no more be called the mistress of king@@ doms .
you said , ' I shall be a mistress forever ; ' so that you did not lay these things to your heart , nor did you remember the latter end of it .
" now therefore hear this , you who are given to pleasures , who sit securely , who say in your heart , ' I am , and there is none else besides me ; I shall not sit as a widow , neither shall I know the loss of children : '
but these two things shall come to you in a moment in one day , the loss of children , and wi@@ do@@ wh@@ ood ; in their full measure shall they come on you , in the multitude of your sorcer@@ ies , and the great abundance of your enchan@@ tments .
" stand now with your enchan@@ tments , and with the multitude of your sorcer@@ ies , in which you have lab@@ ored from your youth ; if so be you shall be able to profit , if so be you may prevail .
you are wear@@ ied in the multitude of your coun@@ sels : let now the astro@@ log@@ ers , the St@@ arg@@ az@@ ers , the monthly prog@@ no@@ stic@@ ators , stand up , and save you from the things that shall come on you .
behold , they shall be as stub@@ ble ; the fire shall burn them ; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame : it shall not be a coal to warm at , nor a fire to sit before .
thus shall the things be to you in which you have lab@@ ored : those who have traff@@ icked with you from your youth shall wander everyone to his quarter ; there shall be none to save you .
( for they call themselves of the holy city , and stay themselves on the God of Israel ; Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies is his name ) :
I have declared the former things from of old ; yes , they went forth out of my mouth , and I showed them : suddenly I did them , and they happened .
you have heard it ; see all this ; and you , will you not declare it ? " I have shown you new things from this time , even hidden things , which you have not known .
yes , you did@@ n '@@ t hear ; yes , you did@@ n '@@ t know ; yes , from of old your ear was not opened : for I knew that you dealt very treach@@ er@@ ously , and was called a trans@@ gres@@ sor from the womb .
for my own sake , for my own sake , will I do it ; for how should my name be prof@@ an@@ ed ? I will not give my glory to another .
" listen to me , O Jacob , and Israel my called : I am he ; I am the first , I also am the last .
" assemble yourselves , all you , and hear ; who among them has declared these things ? he whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h loves shall perform his pleasure on Babylon , and his arm shall be on the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
I , even I , have spoken ; yes , I have called him ; I have brought him , and he shall make his way prosperous .
go forth from Babylon , flee from the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; with a voice of singing declare , tell this , utter it even to the end of the earth : say , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has re@@ deemed his servant Jacob .
they did@@ n '@@ t thirst when he led them through the deserts ; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them ; he split the rock also , and the waters g@@ ushed out .
and he said to me , " You are my servant ; Israel , in whom I will be glori@@ fied . "
but I said , " I have lab@@ ored in vain , I have spent my strength for nothing and van@@ ity ; yet surely the justice due to me is with Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and my reward with my God . "
now says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h who formed me from the womb to be his servant , to bring Jacob again to him , and that Israel be gathered to him ( for I am honorable in the eyes of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and my God has become my strength ) ;
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " In an acceptable time have I answered you , and in a day of salvation have I helped you ; and I will preserve you , and give you for a covenant of the people , to raise up the land , to make them inherit the des@@ ol@@ ate heritage :
saying to those who are bound , ' Come out ! ' ; to those who are in darkness , ' Show yourselves ! ' " they shall feed in the ways , and on all bare heights shall be their past@@ ure .
they shall not hunger nor thirst ; neither shall the heat nor sun strike them : for he who has mercy on them will lead them , even by springs of water he will guide them .
sing , heavens ; and be joyful , earth ; and break forth into singing , mountains : for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has comfor@@ ted his people , and will have compassion on his afflicted .
" can a woman forget her nursing child , that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb ? yes , these may forget , yet I will not forget you !
kings shall be your nursing fathers , and their que@@ ens your nursing mothers : they shall bow down to you with their faces to the earth , and l@@ ick the dust of your feet ; and you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and those who wait for me shall not be disappointed . "
but thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " Even the cap@@ tives of the mighty shall be taken away , and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered ; for I will contend with him who cont@@ ends with you , and I will save your children .
I will feed those who op@@ press you with their own flesh ; and they shall be drun@@ ken with their own blood , as with sweet wine : and all flesh shall know that I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , am your Savior , and your Re@@ deem@@ er , the Mi@@ ghty One of Jacob . "
for the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will help me ; therefore I have not been conf@@ ounded : therefore have I set my face like a fl@@ int , and I know that I shall not be disappointed .
he is near who justifies me ; who will bring charges against me ? let us stand up together : who is my adversary ? let him come near to me .
behold , the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will help me ; who is he who shall condemn me ? behold , all they shall wax old as a garment , the moth shall eat them up .
who is among you who fears Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , who obe@@ ys the voice of his servant ? he who walks in darkness , and has no light , let him trust in the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and rely on his God .
" listen to me , you who follow after righteousness , you who seek Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : look to the rock you were cut from , and to the hold of the pit you were dug from .
for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has comfor@@ ted Z@@ ion ; he has comfor@@ ted all her waste places , and has made her wilderness like Eden , and her desert like the garden of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; joy and gl@@ ad@@ ness shall be found therein , thank@@ s@@ giving , and the voice of melody .
" attend to me , my people ; and give ear to me , my nation : for a law shall go forth from me , and I will establish my justice for a light of the peoples .
my righteousness is near , my salvation is gone forth , and my arms shall judge the peoples ; the islands shall wait for me , and on my arm shall they trust .
" listen to me , you who know righteousness , the people in whose heart is my law ; don '@@ t fear the repro@@ ach of men , neither be dis@@ may@@ ed at their insul@@ ts .

the r@@ ans@@ omed of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall return , and come with singing to Z@@ ion ; and everlasting joy shall be on their heads . they shall obtain gl@@ ad@@ ness and joy . sorrow and sigh@@ ing shall flee away .
" I , even I , am he who comforts you : who are you , that you are afraid of man who shall die , and of the son of man who shall be made as grass ;
I have put my words in your mouth , and have covered you in the shadow of my hand , that I may plant the heavens , and lay the foundations of the earth , and tell Z@@ ion , ' You are my people . ' "
awake , awake , stand up , Jerusalem , that have drunk at the hand of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h the cup of his wrath ; you have drun@@ ken the bowl of the cup of staggering , and drained it .
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has brought forth ; neither is there any who takes her by the hand among all the sons who she has brought up .
these two things have happened to you . who will b@@ emo@@ an you ? des@@ ol@@ ation and destruction , and the famine and the sword ; how shall I comfort you ?
thus says your Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and your God who ple@@ ads the cause of his people , " Be@@ hold , I have taken out of your hand the cup of staggering , even the bowl of the cup of my wrath ; you shall no more drink it again :
shake yourself from the dust ! arise , sit up , Jerusalem ! release yourself from the bonds of your neck , captive daughter of Z@@ ion !
the voice of your watch@@ men ! they lift up the voice , together do they sing ; for they shall see eye to eye , when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h returns to Z@@ ion .
depart , depart , go out from there , touch no un@@ clean thing ! go out of the midst of her ! clean@@ se yourselves , you who bear the vessels of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
for you shall not go out in ha@@ ste , neither shall you go by flight : for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will go before you ; and the God of Israel will be your rear guard .
but he was pi@@ er@@ ced for our trans@@ gres@@ sions . he was crushed for our ini@@ qu@@ ities . the punishment that brought our peace was on him ; and by his wounds we are healed .
all we like sheep have gone astr@@ ay . everyone has turned to his own way ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has laid on him the ini@@ qu@@ ity of us all .
he was oppressed , yet when he was afflicted he did@@ n '@@ t open his mouth . as a lamb that is led to the slaughter , and as a sheep that before its sh@@ ear@@ ers is mute , so he did@@ n '@@ t open his mouth .
he was taken away by oppression and judgment ; and as for his generation , who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living and stricken for the disobedience of my people ?
they made his grave with the wicked , and with a rich man in his death ; although he had done no violence , neither was any dece@@ it in his mouth .
" Don '@@ t be afraid ; for you shall not be ashamed : neither be conf@@ ounded ; for you shall not be disappointed : for you shall forget the shame of your youth ; and the repro@@ ach of your wi@@ do@@ wh@@ ood you shall remember no more .
for your Maker is your husband ; Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies is his name : and the Holy One of Israel is your Re@@ deem@@ er ; the God of the whole earth shall he be called .
" for a small moment have I for@@ s@@ aken you ; but with great mer@@ cies will I gather you .
in over@@ flowing wrath I hid my face from you for a moment ; but with everlasting loving kindness will I have mercy on you , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your Re@@ deem@@ er .
" for this is like the waters of Noah to me ; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more go over the earth , so have I sworn that I will not be angry with you , nor rebu@@ ke you .
for the mountains may depart , and the hills be removed ; but my loving kindness shall not depart from you , neither shall my covenant of peace be removed , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h who has mercy on you .
" you afflicted , tos@@ sed with storms , and not comfor@@ ted , behold , I will set your stones in beautiful colors , and lay your foundations with s@@ app@@ hi@@ res .
in righteousness you shall be established : you shall be far from oppression , for you shall not be afraid ; and from terror , for it shall not come near you .
" behold , I have created the sm@@ ith who blows the fire of co@@ als , and brings forth a weapon for his work ; and I have created the w@@ aster to destroy .
why do you spend money for that which is not bread ? and your labor for that which do@@ es@@ n '@@ t satisfy ? listen dilig@@ ently to me , and eat you that which is good , and let your soul delight itself in fat@@ ness .
behold , I have given him for a witness to the peoples , a leader and commander to the peoples .
behold , you shall call a nation that you don '@@ t know ; and a nation that did@@ n '@@ t know you shall run to you , because of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and for the Holy One of Israel ; for he has glori@@ fied you . "
let the wicked for@@ sake his way , and the un@@ righteous man his thoughts ; and let him return to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and he will have mercy on him ; and to our God , for he will ab@@ und@@ antly pardon .
" for as the heavens are higher than the earth , so are my ways higher than your ways , and my thoughts than your thoughts .
so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth : it shall not return to me void , but it shall accomplish that which I please , and it shall prosper in the thing I sent it to do .
for you shall go out with joy , and be led forth with peace : the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing ; and all the trees of the fields shall cl@@ ap their hands .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " Keep justice , and do righteousness ; for my salvation is near to come , and my righteousness to be revealed .
neither let the foreigner , who has joined himself to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , speak , saying , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will surely separate me from his people " ; neither let the e@@ un@@ uch say , " Be@@ hold , I am a dry tree . "
to them I will give in my house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters ; I will give them an everlasting name , that shall not be cut off .
also the foreigners who join themselves to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to minister to him , and to love the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to be his servants , everyone who keeps the Sabbath from prof@@ aning it , and holds fast my covenant ;
even them will I bring to my holy mountain , and make them joyful in my house of prayer : their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar ; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all peoples . "
his watch@@ men are blind , they are all without knowledge ; they are all mute dogs , they can '@@ t bark ; dreaming , lying down , loving to sl@@ umber .
yes , the dogs are greedy , they can never have enough ; and these are shep@@ herds who can '@@ t understand : they have all turned to their own way , each one to his gain , from every quarter .
" come , " say they , " I will get wine , and we will fill ourselves with strong drink ; and tomorrow shall be as this day , great beyond measure . "
he enters into peace ; they rest in their beds , each one who walks in his upri@@ ghtness .
on a high and lofty mountain you have set your bed ; there also you went up to offer sacrifice .
you were wear@@ ied with the length of your way ; yet you did@@ n '@@ t say , ' It is in vain . ' you found a reviving of your strength ; therefore you wer@@ en '@@ t faint .
for thus says the high and lofty One who inhab@@ its eternity , whose name is Holy : " I dwell in the high and holy place , with him also who is of a contr@@ ite and humble spirit , to revive the spirit of the humble , and to revive the heart of the contr@@ ite .
for I will not contend forever , neither will I be always angry ; for the spirit would faint before me , and the souls who I have made .
for the ini@@ qu@@ ity of his co@@ vet@@ ousness was I angry , and struck him ; I hid myself and was angry ; and he went on back@@ sliding in the way of his heart .
I have seen his ways , and will heal him : I will lead him also , and restore comforts to him and to his mour@@ ners .
yet they seek me daily , and delight to know my ways : as a nation that did righteousness , and did@@ n '@@ t for@@ sake the ordin@@ ance of their God , they ask of me righteous judgments ; they delight to draw near to God .
then your light shall break forth as the morning , and your healing shall spring forth spe@@ ed@@ ily ; and your righteousness shall go before you ; the glory of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall be your rear guard .
then you shall call , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will answer ; you shall cry , and he will say , ' Here I am . ' " if you take away from the midst of you the y@@ oke , the putting forth of the finger , and speaking w@@ ick@@ edly ;
and if you draw out your soul to the hungry , and satisfy the afflicted soul : then your light shall rise in darkness , and your obs@@ cur@@ ity be as the no@@ on@@ day ;
they hat@@ ch Ad@@ ders ' eggs , and we@@ ave the spider 's web : he who eats of their eggs dies ; and that which is crushed breaks out into a vi@@ per .
their web@@ s shall not become garments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works : their works are works of ini@@ qu@@ ity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
we gro@@ pe for the wall like the blind ; yes , we gro@@ pe as those who have no eyes : we stum@@ ble at no@@ on@@ day as in the tw@@ ilight ; among those who are lu@@ sty we are as dead men .
for our trans@@ gres@@ sions are multiplied before you , and our sins testify against us ; for our trans@@ gres@@ sions are with us , and as for our ini@@ qu@@ ities , we know them :
for , behold , darkness shall cover the earth , and gross darkness the peoples ; but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will arise on you , and his glory shall be seen on you .
" lift up your eyes all around , and see : they all gather themselves together , they come to you ; your sons shall come from far , and your daughters shall be carried in the arms .
then you shall see and be radiant , and your heart shall thr@@ ill and be enlarged ; because the abundance of the sea shall be turned to you , the wealth of the nations shall come to you .
the multitude of cam@@ els shall cover you , the dro@@ med@@ aries of Mi@@ dian and ep@@ ha@@ h ; all they from She@@ ba shall come ; they shall bring gold and frank@@ inc@@ ense , and shall proclaim the pra@@ ises of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
surely the islands shall wait for me , and the ships of Tar@@ sh@@ ish first , to bring your sons from far , their silver and their gold with them , for the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and for the Holy One of Israel , because he has glori@@ fied you .
your gates also shall be open continually ; they shall not be shut day nor night ; that men may bring to you the wealth of the nations , and their kings led captive .
you shall also drink the milk of the nations , and shall nurse from royal breasts ; and you shall know that I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , am your Savior , and your Re@@ deem@@ er , the Mi@@ ghty One of Jacob .
the sun shall be no more your light by day ; neither for brightness shall the moon give light to you : but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will be to you an everlasting light , and your God your glory .
your sun shall no more go down , neither shall your moon withdraw itself ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will be your everlasting light , and the days of your mourning shall be ended .
your people also shall be all righteous ; they shall inherit the land forever , the branch of my planting , the work of my hands , that I may be glori@@ fied .
they shall build the old wastes , they shall raise up the former des@@ ol@@ ations , and they shall repair the waste cities , the des@@ ol@@ ations of many generations .
instead of your shame you shall have double ; and instead of dis@@ honor they shall rejoice in their portion : therefore in their land they shall possess double ; everlasting joy shall be to them .
" for I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , love justice , I hate robbery with ini@@ qu@@ ity ; and I will give them their re@@ comp@@ ense in truth , and I will make an everlasting covenant with them .
their seed shall be known among the nations , and their offspring among the peoples ; all who see them shall acknowledge them , that they are the seed which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has blessed . "
for Z@@ ion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jerusalem 's sake I will not rest , until her righteousness go forth as brightness , and her salvation as a lamp that burns .
the nations shall see your righteousness , and all kings your glory , and you shall be called by a new name , which the mouth of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall name .
for as a young man mar@@ ries a virgin , so your sons shall marry you ; and as the bri@@ deg@@ room rejo@@ ices over the bride , so your God will rejoice over you .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has sworn by his right hand , and by the arm of his strength , " Su@@ rely I will no more give your grain to be food for your enemies ; and foreigners shall not drink your new wine , for which you have lab@@ ored :
but those who have gar@@ nered it shall eat it , and praise Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and those who have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary . "
they shall call them The holy people , The re@@ deemed of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : and you shall be called sought out , A city not for@@ s@@ aken .
who is this who comes from E@@ dom , with dy@@ ed garments from Bo@@ z@@ rah ? this who is glorious in his clothing , marching in the greatness of his strength ? " it is I who speak in righteousness , mighty to save . "
I looked , and there was none to help ; and I wondered that there was none to uphold : therefore my own arm brought salvation to me ; and my wrath , it upheld me .
in all their afflic@@ tion he was afflicted , and the angel of his presence saved them : in his love and in his pity he re@@ deemed them ; and he bore them , and carried them all the days of old .
then he remembered the days of old , Moses and his people , saying , Where is he who brought them up out of the sea with the shep@@ herds of his flock ? where is he who put his holy Spirit in their midst ?
who caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses ? who divided the waters before them , to make himself an everlasting name ?
as the livestock that go down into the valley , the Spirit of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h caused them to rest ; so you led your people , to make yourself a glorious name .
look down from heaven , and see from the hab@@ itation of your hol@@ iness and of your glory : where are your zeal and your mighty acts ? the yearning of your heart and your compassion is restrained toward me .
Oh that you would tear the heavens , that you would come down , that the mountains might quake at your presence ,
as when fire kind@@ les the br@@ ush@@ wood , and the fire causes the waters to boil ; to make your name known to your adversaries , that the nations may trem@@ ble at your presence !
you meet him who rejo@@ ices and works righteousness , those who remember you in your ways . behold , you were angry , and we sin@@ ned . we have been in sin for a long time ; and shall we be saved ?
there is none who calls on your name , who stir@@ s up himself to take hold of you ; for you have hidden your face from us , and have consumed us by means of our ini@@ qu@@ ities .
" I am inqui@@ red of by those who did@@ n '@@ t ask ; I am found by those who did@@ n '@@ t seek me : I said , See me , see me , to a nation that was not called by my name .
who sit among the graves , and lodge in the secret places ; who eat pig 's flesh , and bro@@ th of ab@@ om@@ in@@ able things is in their vessels ;
who say , Stand by yourself , don '@@ t come near to me , for I am hol@@ ier than you . these are a smoke in my nose , a fire that burns all the day .
your own ini@@ qu@@ ities , and the ini@@ qu@@ ities of your fathers together , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " who have burned inc@@ ense on the mountains , and bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed me on the hills ; therefore will I first measure their work into their bos@@ om . "
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " As the new wine is found in the cluster , and one says , ' Don '@@ t destroy it , for a blessing is in it : ' so will I do for my servants ' sake , that I may not destroy them all .
I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob , and out of Jud@@ ah an inher@@ itor of my mountains ; and my chosen shall inherit it , and my servants shall dwell there .
Sharon shall be a fold of f@@ locks , and the valley of Ach@@ or a place for herds to lie down in , for my people who have sought me .
you shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen ; and the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will kill you ; and he will call his servants by another name :
so that he who bl@@ esses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth ; and he who sw@@ ears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth ; because the former troubles are forgotten , and because they are hidden from my eyes .
I will rejoice in Jerusalem , and joy in my people ; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of we@@ eping and the voice of crying .
they shall not build , and another inhabit ; they shall not plant , and another eat : for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people , and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands .
they shall not labor in vain , nor bring forth for calamity ; for they are the seed of the blessed of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and their offspring with them .
for all these things has my hand made , and so all these things came to be , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : " but to this man will I look , even to him who is poor and of a contr@@ ite spirit , and who trem@@ bles at my word .
a voice of tum@@ ult from the city , a voice from the temple , a voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h that renders re@@ comp@@ ense to his enemies .
who has heard such a thing ? who has seen such things ? shall a land be born in one day ? shall a nation be brought forth at once ? for as soon as Z@@ ion tr@@ avail@@ ed , she brought forth her children .
shall I bring to the birth , and not cause to bring forth ? " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : " shall I who cause to bring forth shut the womb ? " says your God .
" rejoice with Jerusalem , and be glad for her , all you who love her : rejoice for joy with her , all you who mour@@ n over her ;
for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " Be@@ hold , I will extend peace to her like a river , and the glory of the nations like an over@@ flowing stream : and you will nurse . you will be carried on her side , and will be d@@ and@@ led on her knees .
you will see it , and your heart shall rejoice , and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass : and the hand of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall be known toward his servants ; and he will have indignation against his enemies .
for , behold , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will come with fire , and his ch@@ ari@@ ots shall be like the whir@@ l@@ wind ; to render his anger with fierc@@ eness , and his rebu@@ ke with flames of fire .
for by fire will Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h execute judgment , and by his sword , on all flesh ; and the sl@@ ain of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall be many .
" for I know their works and their thoughts : the time comes , that I will gather all nations and languages ; and they shall come , and shall see my glory .
it shall happen , that from one new moon to another , and from one Sabbath to another , shall all flesh come to worship before me , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
" they shall go forth , and look on the dead bodies of the men who have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me : for their worm shall not die , neither shall their fire be qu@@ en@@ ched ; and they will be lo@@ ath@@ some to all mankind . "
the words of Jer@@ emi@@ ah the son of Hil@@ ki@@ ah , of the priests who were in An@@ ath@@ o@@ th in the land of Benjamin :
to whom the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came in the days of Jo@@ si@@ ah the son of Am@@ on , king of Jud@@ ah , in the thir@@ teenth year of his reign .
" before I formed you in the belly , I knew you . before you came forth out of the womb , I sancti@@ fied you . I have appointed you a prophet to the nations . "
then I said , " Ah , Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ! behold , I don '@@ t know how to speak ; for I am a child . "
but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to me , " Don '@@ t say , ' I am a child ; ' for to whoever I shall send you , you shall go , and whatever I shall command you , you shall speak .
behold , I have this day set you over the nations and over the king@@ doms , to pl@@ uck up and to break down and to destroy and to overthrow , to build and to plant . "
the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came to me the second time , saying , " What do you see ? " I said , " I see a boiling cal@@ dr@@ on ; and it is tipping away from the north . "
for , behold , I will call all the families of the king@@ doms of the north , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; " and they shall come , and they shall each set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem , and against all its walls all around , and against all the cities of Jud@@ ah .
I will utter my judgments against them touching all their w@@ ick@@ edness , in that they have for@@ s@@ aken me , and have burned inc@@ ense to other gods , and worshi@@ ped the works of their own hands .
for , behold , I have made you this day a fortified city , and an iron pillar , and bronze walls , against the whole land , against the kings of Jud@@ ah , against its princes , against its priests , and against the people of the land .
they will fight against you ; but they will not prevail against you ; for I am with you , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " to deliver you . "
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " What un@@ righteousness have your fathers found in me , that they have gone far from me , and have walked after van@@ ity , and are become vain ?
" for my people have committed two evils : they have for@@ s@@ aken me , the spring of living waters , and cut them out ci@@ ster@@ ns , broken ci@@ ster@@ ns , that can hold no water .
the young lions have ro@@ ared at him , and y@@ elled . they have made his land waste . his cities are burned up , without inhabit@@ ant .
now what have you to do in the way to Egypt , to drink the waters of the Shi@@ h@@ or ? or what have you to do in the way to As@@ sy@@ ria , to drink the waters of the River ?
" your own w@@ ick@@ edness shall correct you , and your back@@ sliding shall re@@ prove you . know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and a bitter , that you have for@@ s@@ aken Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and that my fear is not in you , " says the Lord , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies .
yet I had planted you a noble vine , wholly a right seed . how then have you turned into the de@@ generate branches of a foreign vine to me ?
" I have struck your children in vain . they received no correction . your own sword has dev@@ oured your prophets , like a destroying lion .
also the blood of the souls of the innocent poor is found in your skirts . you did not find them breaking in ; but it is because of all these things .
from there also you shall go forth , with your hands on your head ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has rejected those in whom you trust , and you shall not prosper with them .
" lift up your eyes to the bare heights , and see ! where have you not been lain with ? you have sat for them by the ways , as an Arabian in the wilderness . you have polluted the land with your prostitution and with your w@@ ick@@ edness .
therefore the showers have been with@@ held , and there has been no latter rain ; yet you have a pro@@ stitute 's forehead , you refused to be ashamed .
moreover , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to me in the days of Jo@@ si@@ ah the king , " Have you seen that which back@@ sliding Israel has done ? she has gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree , and there has played the pro@@ stitute .
I saw , when , for this very cause that back@@ sliding Israel had committed adul@@ tery , I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce , yet treach@@ erous Jud@@ ah , her sister , did@@ n '@@ t fear ; but she also went and played the pro@@ stitute .
yet for all this her treach@@ erous sister , Jud@@ ah , has not returned to me with her whole heart , but only in pre@@ tense , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
only acknowledge your ini@@ qu@@ ity , that you have trans@@ g@@ ressed against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree , and you have not obeyed my voice , ' says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
" return , back@@ sliding children , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; " for I am a husband to you . I will take you one of a city , and two of a family , and I will bring you to Z@@ ion .
in those days the house of Jud@@ ah shall walk with the house of Israel , and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your fathers .
" if you will return , Israel , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " if you will return to me , and if you will put away your ab@@ om@@ inations out of my sight ; then you shall not be removed ;
and you shall swear , ' As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , ' in truth , in justice , and in righteousness . the nations shall bless themselves in him , and in him shall they glory . "
for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to the men of Jud@@ ah and to Jerusalem , " Bre@@ ak up your f@@ allow ground , and don '@@ t sow among thor@@ ns .
circum@@ c@@ ise yourselves to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and take away the fores@@ kins of your heart , you men of Jud@@ ah and inhabitants of Jerusalem ; lest my wrath go forth like fire , and burn so that none can qu@@ en@@ ch it , because of the evil of your do@@ ings .
declare in Jud@@ ah , and publish in Jerusalem ; and say , ' B@@ low the trum@@ pet in the land ! ' cry aloud and say , ' assemble yourselves ! let us go into the fortified cities ! '
set up a standard toward Z@@ ion . flee for safety ! Don '@@ t wait ; for I will bring evil from the north , and a great destruction . "
a lion is gone up from his th@@ icket , and a destro@@ yer of nations ; he is on his way , he is gone forth from his place , to make your land des@@ ol@@ ate , that your cities be laid waste , without inhabit@@ ant .
for this clo@@ the yourself with s@@ ack@@ cloth , lam@@ ent and w@@ ail ; for the fierce anger of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h h@@ as@@ n '@@ t turned back from us .
at that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem , " A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people , not to win@@ now , nor to clean@@ se ;
behold , he shall come up as clouds , and his ch@@ ari@@ ots shall be as the whir@@ l@@ wind : his horses are swif@@ ter than eag@@ les . w@@ oe to us ! for we are ruined .
as keepers of a field , they are against her all around , because she has been rebelli@@ ous against me , ' " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
" your way and your do@@ ings have brought these things to you . this is your w@@ ick@@ edness ; for it is bitter , for it reaches to your heart . "
my angu@@ ish , my angu@@ ish ! I am p@@ ained at my very heart ; my heart is dis@@ qui@@ eted in me ; I can '@@ t hold my peace ; because you have heard , O my soul , the sound of the trum@@ pet , the alarm of war .
destruction on destruction is cried ; for the whole land is laid waste : suddenly are my tents destroyed , and my curtains in a moment .
" for my people are foolish , they don '@@ t know me . they are foolish children , and they have no understanding . they are skillful in doing evil , but to do good they have no knowledge . "
I saw , and behold , there was no man , and all the birds of the sky had fled .
I saw , and behold , the fruitful field was a wilderness , and all its cities were broken down at the presence of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , before his fierce anger .
for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " The whole land shall be a des@@ ol@@ ation ; yet will I not make a full end .
for this the earth will mour@@ n , and the heavens above be black ; because I have spoken it , I have pur@@ posed it , and I have not rep@@ ented , neither will I turn back from it . "
therefore a lion out of the forest shall kill them , a wolf of the evenings shall destroy them , a le@@ op@@ ard shall watch against their cities ; everyone who goes out there shall be torn in pieces ; because their trans@@ gres@@ sions are many , and their back@@ sliding is increased .
" how can I pardon you ? your children have for@@ s@@ aken me , and sworn by what are no gods . when I had fed them to the full , they committed adul@@ tery , and assembled themselves in troops at the prostitutes ' houses .
Sh@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t I punish them for these things ? " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; " and shoul@@ d@@ n '@@ t my soul be av@@ eng@@ ed on such a nation as this ?
" go up on her walls , and destroy ; but don '@@ t make a full end . take away her branches ; for they are not Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's .
for the house of Israel and the house of Jud@@ ah have dealt very treach@@ er@@ ously against me , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
behold , I will bring a nation on you from far , house of Israel , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . " it is a mighty nation . it is an ancient nation , a nation whose language you don '@@ t know , neither understand what they say .
" but even in those days , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " I will not make a full end with you .
neither do they say in their heart , ' Let us now fear Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God , who gives rain , both the former and the latter , in its season ; who preserves to us the appointed weeks of the harvest . '
as a cage is full of birds , so are their houses full of dece@@ it . therefore they have become great , and grew rich .
" shall I not punish for these things ? " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . " shall not my soul be av@@ eng@@ ed on such a nation as this ?
the prophets proph@@ esy fal@@ sely , and the priests rule by their own authority ; and my people love to have it so . what will you do in the end of it ?
shep@@ herds with their f@@ locks shall come to her ; they shall pitch their tents against her all around ; they shall feed everyone in his place . "
for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies said , " C@@ ut down trees , and cast up a m@@ ound against Jerusalem : this is the city to be visited ; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , " They shall thoroughly g@@ lean the remn@@ ant of Israel like a vine . turn again your hand as a grap@@ e gather@@ er into the bas@@ kets . "
to whom shall I speak and testify , that they may hear ? behold , their ear is un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , and they can '@@ t listen . behold , the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has become a repro@@ ach to them . they have no delight in it .
their houses shall be turned to others , their fields and their wives together ; for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants of the land , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
" for from their least even to their greatest , everyone is given to co@@ vet@@ ousness ; and from the prophet even to the priest , everyone deals fal@@ sely .
they have healed also the hurt of my people superf@@ icially , saying , ' Peace , peace ! ' when there is no peace .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " Stand in the ways and see , and ask for the old paths , ' Where is the good way ? ' and walk in it , and you will find rest for your souls . but they said , ' We will not walk in it . '
hear , earth ! behold , I will bring evil on this people , even the fruit of their thoughts , because they have not listened to my words ; and as for my law , they have rejected it .
to what purpose comes there to me frank@@ inc@@ ense from She@@ ba , and the sweet cane from a far country ? your burnt offerings are not acceptable , nor your sacrifices pleasing to me . "
therefore thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " Be@@ hold , I will lay stumbling blocks before this people . the fathers and the sons together shall stum@@ ble against them . the neighbor and his friend shall perish . "
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " Be@@ hold , a people comes from the north country . a great nation shall be stirred up from the utter@@ most parts of the earth .
they take hold of bow and spe@@ ar . they are cruel , and have no mercy . their voice ro@@ ars like the sea , and they ride on horses , everyone set in array , as a man to the battle , against you , daughter of Z@@ ion . "
Don '@@ t go forth into the field , nor walk by the way ; for the sword of the enemy and terror , are on every side .
" I have made you a t@@ ester of metals and a fortress among my people ; that you may know and try their way .
Don '@@ t trust in lying words , saying , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's temple , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's temple , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's temple , are these .
if you don '@@ t op@@ press the foreigner , the fa@@ ther@@ less , and the widow , and don '@@ t shed innocent blood in this place , neither walk after other gods to your own hurt :
then will I cause you to dwell in this place , in the land that I gave to your fathers , from of old even fore@@ ver@@ more .
is this house , which is called by my name , become a den of rob@@ bers in your eyes ? behold , I , even I , have seen it , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
but go now to my place which was in Sh@@ il@@ oh , where I caused my name to dwell at the first , and see what I did to it for the w@@ ick@@ edness of my people Israel .
now , because you have done all these works , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and I spoke to you , rising up early and speaking , but you did@@ n '@@ t hear ; and I called you , but you did@@ n '@@ t answer :
I will cast you out of my sight , as I have cast out all your brothers , even the whole seed of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
do they provoke me to anger ? says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . Don '@@ t they provoke themselves , to the confusion of their own faces ?
you shall tell them , This is the nation that has not listened to the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God , nor received instruction : truth is perished , and is cut off from their mouth .
cut off your hair , and throw it away , and take up a lam@@ entation on the bare heights ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has rejected and for@@ s@@ aken the generation of his wrath .
for the children of Jud@@ ah have done that which is evil in my sight , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : they have set their ab@@ om@@ inations in the house which is called by my name , to def@@ ile it .
they have built the high places of T@@ oph@@ eth , which is in the valley of the son of H@@ inno@@ m , to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire ; which I did@@ n '@@ t command , nor did it come into my mind .
therefore behold , the days come , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that it shall no more be called T@@ oph@@ eth , nor The valley of the son of H@@ inno@@ m , but The valley of S@@ laughter : for they shall bury in T@@ oph@@ eth , until there is no place to bury .
death shall be chosen rather than life by all the resi@@ due that remain of this evil family , that remain in all the places where I have driven them , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies .
moreover you shall tell them , Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : shall men fall , and not rise up again ? shall one turn away , and not return ?
yes , the stor@@ k in the sky knows her appointed times ; and the tur@@ t@@ le@@ do@@ ve and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming ; but my people don '@@ t know Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's law .
the wise men are disappointed , they are dis@@ may@@ ed and taken : behold , they have rejected the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and what kind of wisdom is in them ?
therefore will I give their wives to others , and their fields to those who shall possess them : for everyone from the least even to the greatest is given to co@@ vet@@ ousness ; from the prophet even to the priest every one deals fal@@ sely .
were they ashamed when they had committed ab@@ om@@ ination ? n@@ ay , they were not at all ashamed , neither could they bl@@ ush : therefore shall they fall among those who fall ; in the time of their vis@@ itation they shall be cast down , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
I will utterly consume them , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : no grapes shall be on the vine , nor fi@@ gs on the fi@@ g tree , and the leaf shall fade ; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them .
is there no bal@@ m in Gil@@ e@@ ad ? is there no physician there ? why then is@@ n '@@ t the health of the daughter of my people recovered ?
Oh that my head were waters , and my eyes a spring of tears , that I might we@@ ep day and night for the sl@@ ain of the daughter of my people !
Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of way@@ far@@ ing men ; that I might leave my people , and go from them ! for they are all adul@@ ter@@ ers , an assembly of treach@@ erous men .
they bend their tongue , as their bow , for false@@ hood ; and they are grown strong in the land , but not for truth : for they proceed from evil to evil , and they don '@@ t know me , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
they will deceive everyone his neighbor , and will not speak the truth : they have taught their tongue to speak lies ; they weary themselves to commit ini@@ qu@@ ity .
therefore thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , Be@@ hold , I will melt them , and try them ; for how should I deal with the daughter of my people ?
their tongue is a deadly arrow ; it speaks dece@@ it : one speaks peace@@ ably to his neighbor with his mouth , but in his heart he lays wait for him .
I will make Jerusalem he@@ aps , a dwelling place of jack@@ als ; and I will make the cities of Jud@@ ah a des@@ ol@@ ation , without inhabit@@ ant .
therefore thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , the God of Israel , Be@@ hold , I will feed them , even this people , with wor@@ m@@ wood , and give them water of g@@ all to drink .
I will sc@@ atter them also among the nations , whom neither they nor their fathers have known ; and I will send the sword after them , until I have consumed them .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , Con@@ sider , and call for the mourning women , that they may come ; and send for the skillful women , that they may come :
and let them make ha@@ ste , and take up a w@@ ailing for us , that our eyes may run down with tears , and our ey@@ eli@@ ds g@@ ush out with waters .
for a voice of w@@ ailing is heard out of Z@@ ion , How are we ruined ! we are greatly conf@@ ounded , because we have for@@ s@@ aken the land , because they have cast down our dwell@@ ings .
for death has come up into our windows , it is entered into our palaces ; to cut off the children from outside , and the young men from the streets .
speak , Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , The dead bodies of men shall fall as d@@ ung on the open field , and as the handful after the har@@ vest@@ er ; and none shall gather them .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , Don '@@ t let the wise man glory in his wisdom , neither let the mighty man glory in his might , don '@@ t let the rich man glory in his riches ;
but let him who gl@@ ories glory in this , that he has understanding , and knows me , that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h who exercises loving kindness , justice , and righteousness , in the earth : for in these things I delight , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
Egypt , and Jud@@ ah , and E@@ dom , and the children of Am@@ mon , and Mo@@ ab , and all that have the corners of their hair cut off , who dwell in the wilderness ; for all the nations are un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , and all the house of Israel are un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised in heart .
they are like a palm tree , of turned work , and don '@@ t speak : they must be carried , because they can '@@ t go . Don '@@ t be afraid of them ; for they can '@@ t do evil , neither is it in them to do good . "
who should not fear you , King of the nations ? for it ap@@ per@@ tains to you ; because among all the wise men of the nations , and in all their royal estate , there is none like you .
there is silver beaten into plates , which is brought from Tar@@ sh@@ ish , and gold from Up@@ haz , the work of the arti@@ fic@@ er and of the hands of the g@@ old@@ sm@@ ith ; blue and purple for their clothing ; they are all the work of skillful men .
but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is the true God ; he is the living God , and an everlasting King : at his wrath the earth trem@@ bles , and the nations are not able to withstand his indignation .
every man has become bru@@ tish and without knowledge ; every g@@ old@@ sm@@ ith is disappointed by his engra@@ ved image ; for his mol@@ ten image is false@@ hood , and there is no breath in them .
my tent is destroyed , and all my cor@@ ds are broken : my children are gone forth from me , and they are no more : there is none to spread my tent any more , and to set up my curtains .
pour out your wrath on the nations that don '@@ t know you , and on the families that don '@@ t call on your name : for they have dev@@ oured Jacob , yes , they have dev@@ oured him and consumed him , and have laid waste his hab@@ itation .
and say to them , Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel : cur@@ sed is the man who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t hear the words of this covenant ,
that I may establish the oath which I s@@ wore to your fathers , to give them a land flowing with milk and honey , as at this day . then answered I , and said , A@@ men , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to me , proclaim all these words in the cities of Jud@@ ah , and in the streets of Jerusalem , saying , He@@ ar the words of this covenant , and do them .
yet they did@@ n '@@ t obey , nor turn their ear , but walked everyone in the stubbor@@ n@@ ness of their evil heart : therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant , which I commanded them to do , but they did@@ n '@@ t do them .
they are turned back to the ini@@ qu@@ ities of their fore@@ fathers , who refused to hear my words ; and they are gone after other gods to serve them : the house of Israel and the house of Jud@@ ah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers .
therefore thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , Be@@ hold , I will bring evil on them , which they shall not be able to escape ; and they shall cry to me , but I will not listen to them .
then shall the cities of Jud@@ ah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry to the gods to which they offer inc@@ ense : but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble .
for according to the number of your cities are your gods , Jud@@ ah ; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up al@@ t@@ ars to the shameful thing , even al@@ t@@ ars to burn inc@@ ense to Ba@@ al .
what has my beloved to do in my house , since she has worked le@@ w@@ dness with many , and the holy flesh is passed from you ? when you do evil , then you rejoice .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h called your name , A green olive tree , beautiful with goo@@ dly fruit : with the noise of a great tum@@ ult he has kind@@ led fire on it , and its branches are broken .
for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , who planted you , has pronounced evil against you , because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Jud@@ ah , which they have worked for themselves in provoking me to anger by offering inc@@ ense to Ba@@ al .
but , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , who judges righte@@ ously , who tests the heart and the mind , I shall see your vengeance on them ; for to you have I revealed my cause .
therefore thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h concerning the men of An@@ ath@@ o@@ th , who seek your life , saying , You shall not proph@@ esy in the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that you not die by our hand ;
therefore thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , Be@@ hold , I will punish them : the young men shall die by the sword ; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine ;
and there shall be no remn@@ ant to them : for I will bring evil on the men of An@@ ath@@ o@@ th , even the year of their vis@@ itation .
you are righteous , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , when I contend with you ; yet I would reason the cause with you : why does the way of the wicked prosper ? why are all they at ease who deal very treach@@ er@@ ously ?
you have planted them , yes , they have taken root ; they grow , yes , they bring forth fruit : you are near in their mouth , and far from their heart .
if you have run with the foot@@ men , and they have wear@@ ied you , then how can you contend with horses ? and though in a land of peace you are secure , yet how will you do in the pride of the Jordan ?
for even your brothers , and the house of your father , even they have dealt treach@@ er@@ ously with you ; even they have cried aloud after you : Don '@@ t believe them , though they speak beautiful words to you .
many shep@@ herds have destroyed my viney@@ ard , they have tro@@ dden my portion under foot , they have made my pleasant portion a des@@ ol@@ ate wilderness .
destroyers have come on all the bare heights in the wilderness ; for the sword of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h dev@@ ours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land : no flesh has peace .
they have s@@ own wheat , and have re@@ aped thor@@ ns ; they have put themselves to pain , and profit nothing : and you shall be ashamed of your fruits , because of the fierce anger of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h against all my evil neighbors , who touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit : behold , I will pl@@ uck them up from off their land , and will pl@@ uck up the house of Jud@@ ah from among them .
it shall happen , if they will dilig@@ ently learn the ways of my people , to swear by my name , As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives ; even as they taught my people to swear by Ba@@ al ; then shall they be built up in the midst of my people .
but if they will not hear , then will I pl@@ uck up that nation , pl@@ uc@@ king up and destroying it , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
take the belt that you have bought , which is on your waist , and arise , go to the E@@ uph@@ rates , and hide it there in a cle@@ ft of the rock .
it happened after many days , that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to me , A@@ rise , go to the E@@ uph@@ rates , and take the belt from there , which I commanded you to hide there .
therefore you shall speak to them this word : thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , Every bottle shall be filled with wine : and they shall tell you , Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine ?
I will d@@ ash them one against another , even the fathers and the sons together , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : I will not pity , nor spare , nor have compassion , that I should not destroy them .
what will you say , when he shall set over you as head those whom you have yourself taught to be friends to you ? shall not sor@@ rows take hold of you , as of a woman in trav@@ ail ?
I have seen your ab@@ om@@ inations , even your adul@@ ter@@ ies , and your neigh@@ ing , the le@@ w@@ dness of your prostitution , on the hills in the field . w@@ oe to you , Jerusalem ! you will not be made clean ; how long shall it yet be ?
Jud@@ ah mour@@ ns , and its gates langu@@ ish , they sit in black on the ground ; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up .
their no@@ bles send their little ones to the waters : they come to the ci@@ ster@@ ns , and find no water ; they return with their vessels empty ; they are disappointed and conf@@ ounded , and cover their heads .
yes , the h@@ ind also in the field cal@@ ves , and for@@ s@@ akes her young , because there is no grass .
you hope of Israel , its Savior in the time of trouble , why should you be as a foreigner in the land , and as a way@@ far@@ ing man who turns aside to stay for a night ?
why should you be like a scared man , as a mighty man who can '@@ t save ? yet you , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , are in the midst of us , and we are called by your name ; don '@@ t leave us .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to this people , Even so have they loved to wander ; they have not ref@@ rained their feet : therefore Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h does not accept them ; now he will remember their ini@@ qu@@ ity , and visit their sins .
when they fast , I will not hear their cry ; and when they offer burnt offering and meal offering , I will not accept them ; but I will consume them by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pesti@@ l@@ ence .
you shall say this word to them , Let my eyes run down with tears night and day , and let them not cease ; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach , with a very griev@@ ous wound .
have you utterly rejected Jud@@ ah ? has your soul lo@@ athed Z@@ ion ? why have you struck us , and there is no healing for us ? we looked for peace , but no good came ; and for a time of healing , and behold , dis@@ may !
do not abh@@ or us , for your name 's sake ; do not dis@@ grace the throne of your glory : remember , don '@@ t break your covenant with us .
I will appoint over them four kinds , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : the sword to kill , and the dogs to tear , and the birds of the sky , and the animals of the earth , to dev@@ our and to destroy .
I will cause them to be tos@@ sed back and forth among all the king@@ doms of the earth , because of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , the son of He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , king of Jud@@ ah , for that which he did in Jerusalem .
you have rejected me , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , you have gone backward : therefore have I stretched out my hand against you , and destroyed you ; I am weary with rep@@ enting .
I have win@@ now@@ ed them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I have ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed them of children , I have destroyed my people ; they did@@ n '@@ t return from their ways .
their wid@@ ows are increased to me above the sand of the seas ; I have brought on them against the mother of the young men a destro@@ yer at no@@ on@@ day : I have caused angu@@ ish and terr@@ ors to fall on her suddenly .
she who has borne seven langu@@ ishes ; she has given up the spirit ; her sun is gone down while it was yet day ; she has been disappointed and conf@@ ounded : and their resi@@ due will I deliver to the sword before their enemies , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said , Most certainly I will strengthen you for good ; most certainly I will cause the enemy to make suppl@@ ication to you in the time of evil and in the time of afflic@@ tion .
your substance and your treasures will I give for a spoil without price , and that for all your sins , even in all your borders .
I will make them to pass with your enemies into a land which you don '@@ t know ; for a fire is kind@@ led in my anger , which shall burn on you .
I did@@ n '@@ t sit in the assembly of those who make mer@@ ry , nor rejo@@ iced ; I sat alone because of your hand ; for you have filled me with indignation .
I will make you to this people a fortified bronze wall ; and they shall fight against you , but they shall not prevail against you ; for I am with you to save you and to deliver you , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , Don '@@ t enter into the house of mourning , neither go to lam@@ ent , neither b@@ emo@@ an them ; for I have taken away my peace from this people , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , even loving kindness and tender mer@@ cies .
both great and small shall die in this land ; they shall not be buried , neither shall men lam@@ ent for them , nor cut themselves , nor make themselves bal@@ d for them ;
therefore will I cast you forth out of this land into the land that you have not known , neither you nor your fathers ; and there you shall serve other gods day and night ; for I will show you no favor .
therefore behold , the days come , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that it shall no more be said , As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
but , As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north , and from all the countries where he had driven them . I will bring them again into their land that I gave to their fathers .
behold , I will send for many fishermen , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and they shall fish them up ; and afterward I will send for many hunters , and they shall hunt them from every mountain , and from every hill , and out of the cle@@ fts of the rocks .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , my strength , and my strongh@@ old , and my refuge in the day of afflic@@ tion , to you shall the nations come from the ends of the earth , and shall say , Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies , van@@ ity and things in which there is no profit .
therefore behold , I will cause them to know , this once will I cause them to know my hand and my might ; and they shall know that my name is Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
my mountain in the field , I will give your substance and all your treasures for a spoil , and your high places , because of sin , throughout all your borders .
for he shall be like the he@@ ath in the desert , and shall not see when good comes , but shall inhabit the par@@ ched places in the wilderness , a salt land and not inhabited .
I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , search the mind , I try the heart , even to give every man according to his ways , according to the fruit of his do@@ ings .
a glorious throne , set on high from the beginning , is the place of our sanctuary .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the hope of Israel , all who for@@ sake you shall be disappointed . those who depart from me shall be written in the earth , because they have for@@ s@@ aken Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the spring of living waters .
heal me , O Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and I shall be healed ; save me , and I shall be saved : for you are my praise .
as for me , I have not hur@@ ried from being a shepherd after you ; neither have I desired the wo@@ eful day ; you know : that which came out of my lips was before your face .
let them be disappointed who persec@@ ute me , but let not me be disappointed ; let them be dis@@ may@@ ed , but don '@@ t let me be dis@@ may@@ ed ; bring on them the day of evil , and destroy them with double destruction .
and tell them , He@@ ar the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , you kings of Jud@@ ah , and all Jud@@ ah , and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , that enter in by these gates :
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , Take heed to yourselves , and bear no burden on the Sabbath day , nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem ;
but they did@@ n '@@ t listen , neither turn their ear , but made their neck stiff , that they might not hear , and might not receive instruction .
it shall happen , if you dilig@@ ently listen to me , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day , but to make the Sabbath day holy , to do no work therein ;
then shall there enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David , riding in ch@@ ari@@ ots and on horses , they , and their princes , the men of Jud@@ ah , and the inhabitants of Jerusalem ; and this city shall remain forever .
but if you will not listen to me to make the Sabbath day holy , and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day ; then will I kind@@ le a fire in its gates , and it shall dev@@ our the palaces of Jerusalem , and it shall not be qu@@ en@@ ched .
arise , and go down to the pot@@ ter 's house , and there I will cause you to hear my words .
when the vessel that he made of the clay was mar@@ red in the hand of the pot@@ ter , he made it again another vessel , as seemed good to the pot@@ ter to make it .
at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a kingdom , to pl@@ uck up and to break down and to destroy it ;
if they do that which is evil in my sight , that they not obey my voice , then I will repent of the good , with which I said I would benefit them .
but they say , It is in vain ; for we will walk after our own devices , and we will do everyone after the stubbor@@ n@@ ness of his evil heart .
therefore thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : ask now among the nations , who has heard such things ; the virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing .
I will sc@@ atter them as with an east wind before the enemy ; I will show them the back , and not the face , in the day of their calamity .
yet , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , you know all their counsel against me to kill me ; don '@@ t forgive their ini@@ qu@@ ity , neither b@@ lot out their sin from your sight ; but let them be overthrown before you ; deal you with them in the time of your anger .
thus said Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , Go , and buy a pot@@ ter 's ear@@ then bottle , and take some of the elders of the people , and of the elders of the priests ;
and say , He@@ ar the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , kings of Jud@@ ah , and inhabitants of Jerusalem : thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , the God of Israel , Be@@ hold , I will bring evil on this place , which whoever hears , his ears shall ting@@ le .
because they have for@@ s@@ aken me , and have e@@ strang@@ ed this place , and have burned inc@@ ense in it to other gods , that they did@@ n '@@ t know , they and their fathers and the kings of Jud@@ ah ; and have filled this place with the blood of inno@@ cents ,
and have built the high places of Ba@@ al , to burn their sons in the fire for burnt offerings to Ba@@ al ; which I did@@ n '@@ t command , nor spoke it , neither came it into my mind :
therefore , behold , the days come , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that this place shall no more be called T@@ oph@@ eth , nor The valley of the son of H@@ inno@@ m , but The valley of S@@ laughter .
and shall tell them , Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies : even so will I break this people and this city , as one breaks a pot@@ ter 's vessel , that can '@@ t be made whole again ; and they shall bury in T@@ oph@@ eth , until there is no place to bury .
then came Jer@@ emi@@ ah from T@@ oph@@ eth , where Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had sent him to proph@@ esy ; and he stood in the court of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's house , and said to all the people :
then Pash@@ hu@@ r struck Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet , and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin , which was in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
you , Pash@@ hu@@ r , and all who dwell in your house shall go into cap@@ tivity ; and you shall come to Babylon , and there you shall die , and there you shall be buried , you , and all your friends , to whom you have prophe@@ si@@ ed fal@@ sely .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , you have persuaded me , and I was persuaded ; you are stronger than I , and have prevailed : I am become a laughing @@@ -@@ @ stock all the day , every one mo@@ cks me .
for as often as I speak , I cry out ; I cry , Viol@@ ence and destruction ! because the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is made a repro@@ ach to me , and a deri@@ sion , all the day .
but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is with me as an awesome mighty one : therefore my persec@@ utors shall stum@@ ble , and they shall not prevail ; they shall be utterly disappointed , because they have not dealt wisely , even with an everlasting dis@@ honor which shall never be forgotten .
but , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , who tests the righteous , who sees the heart and the mind , let me see your vengeance on them ; for to you have I revealed my cause .
I myself will fight against you with an out@@ stretched hand and with a strong arm , even in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation .
to this people you shall say , Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , I set before you the way of life and the way of death .
for I have set my face on this city for evil , and not for good , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire .
behold , I am against you , O inhabit@@ ant of the valley , and of the rock of the plain , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; you that say , Who shall come down against us ? or who shall enter into our hab@@ itations ?
I will punish you according to the fruit of your do@@ ings , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and I will kind@@ le a fire in her forest , and it shall dev@@ our all that is around her .
say , He@@ ar the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , king of Jud@@ ah , who sits on the throne of David , you , and your servants , and your people who enter in by these gates .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : execute justice and righteousness , and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the op@@ pres@@ sor : and do no wrong , do no violence , to the foreigner , the fa@@ ther@@ less , nor the widow ; neither shed innocent blood in this place .
for if you do this thing indeed , then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting on the throne of David , riding in ch@@ ari@@ ots and on horses , he , and his servants , and his people .
I will prepare destroyers against you , everyone with his weapons ; and they shall cut down your choice c@@ ed@@ ars , and cast them into the fire .
for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h touching Sh@@ all@@ um the son of Jo@@ si@@ ah , king of Jud@@ ah , who re@@ igned instead of Jo@@ si@@ ah his father , and who went forth out of this place : he shall not return there any more .
but in the place where they have led him captive , there shall he die , and he shall see this land no more .
w@@ oe to him who builds his house by un@@ righteousness , and his rooms by injustice ; who uses his neighbor 's service without wages , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t give him his hire ;
he shall be buried with the burial of a don@@ key , drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem .
inhabit@@ ant of Lebanon , who makes your nest in the c@@ ed@@ ars , how greatly to be p@@ iti@@ ed you will be when p@@ ang@@ s come on you , the pain as of a woman in trav@@ ail !
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , Write you this man chil@@ dless , a man who shall not prosper in his days ; for no more shall a man of his seed prosper , sitting on the throne of David , and ruling in Jud@@ ah .
I will gather the remn@@ ant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them , and will bring them again to their fol@@ ds ; and they shall be fruitful and multiply .
behold , the days come , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that I will raise to David a righteous Branch , and he shall reign as king and deal wisely , and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land .
therefore behold , the days come , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that they shall no more say , As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
but , As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , who brought up and who led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country , and from all the countries where I had driven them . they shall dwell in their own land .
concerning the prophets . my heart within me is broken , all my bones shake ; I am like a drun@@ ken man , and like a man whom wine has overcome , because of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and because of his holy words .
for the land is full of adul@@ ter@@ ers ; for because of sw@@ earing the land mour@@ ns ; the past@@ ures of the wilderness are dried up . their course is evil , and their might is not right ;
therefore their way shall be to them as slip@@ per@@ y places in the darkness : they shall be driven on , and fall therein ; for I will bring evil on them , even the year of their vis@@ itation , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
therefore thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies concerning the prophets : behold , I will feed them with wor@@ m@@ wood , and make them drink the water of g@@ all ; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is un@@ god@@ liness gone forth into all the land .
for who has stood in the council of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that he should perceive and hear his word ? who has marked my word , and heard it ?
the anger of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall not return , until he has executed , and until he have performed the int@@ ents of his heart : in the latter days you shall understand it perfectly .
but if they had stood in my council , then had they caused my people to hear my words , and had turned them from their evil way , and from the evil of their do@@ ings .
when this people , or the prophet , or a priest , shall ask you , saying , What is the burden of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ? then you shall tell them , What burden ! I will cast you off , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
as for the prophet , and the priest , and the people , who shall say , The burden of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , I will even punish that man and his house .
therefore , behold , I will utterly forget you , and I will cast you off , and the city that I gave to you and to your fathers , away from my presence :
one basket had very good fi@@ gs , like the fi@@ gs that are first @@@ -@@ @ ripe ; and the other basket had very bad fi@@ gs , which could not be eaten , they were so bad .
for I will set my eyes on them for good , and I will bring them again to this land : and I will build them , and not pull them down ; and I will plant them , and not pl@@ uck them up .
I will give them a heart to know me , that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God ; for they shall return to me with their whole heart .
I will even give them up to be tos@@ sed back and forth among all the king@@ doms of the earth for evil ; to be a repro@@ ach and a prover@@ b , a ta@@ unt and a curse , in all places where I shall drive them .
I will send the sword , the famine , and the pesti@@ l@@ ence , among them , until they be consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers .
the word that came to Jer@@ emi@@ ah concerning all the people of Jud@@ ah , in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jo@@ si@@ ah , king of Jud@@ ah ( the same was the first year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon ) ,
saying , Return now everyone from his evil way , and from the evil of your do@@ ings , and dwell in the land that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has given to you and to your fathers , from of old and even fore@@ ver@@ more ;
and don '@@ t go after other gods to serve them or worship them , and don '@@ t provoke me to anger with the work of your hands ; and I will do you no harm .
it shall happen , when seventy years are accomplished , that I will punish the king of Babylon , and that nation , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , for their ini@@ qu@@ ity , and the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; and I will make it des@@ ol@@ ate forever .
for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , to me : take this cup of the wine of wrath at my hand , and cause all the nations , to whom I send you , to drink it .
they shall drink , and re@@ el back and forth , and be mad , because of the sword that I will send among them .
then took I the cup at Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's hand , and made all the nations to drink , to whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had sent me :
Jerusalem , and the cities of Jud@@ ah , and its kings , and its princes , to make them a des@@ ol@@ ation , an aston@@ ishment , a his@@ sing , and a curse , as it is this day ;
and all the mixed people , and all the kings of the land of the U@@ z , and all the kings of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and Ash@@ kel@@ on , and Gaza , and Ek@@ ron , and the remn@@ ant of Ash@@ do@@ d ;
and all the kings of Ty@@ re , and all the kings of Sid@@ on , and the kings of the is@@ le which is beyond the sea ;
and all the kings of Arabia , and all the kings of the mixed people who dwell in the wilderness ;
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another ; and all the king@@ doms of the world , which are on the surface of the earth : and the king of Sh@@ esh@@ ach shall drink after them .
you shall tell them , Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , the God of Israel : drink , and be drunk , vom@@ it , fall , and rise no more , because of the sword which I will send among you .
it shall be , if they refuse to take the cup at your hand to drink , then you shall tell them , Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies : you shall surely drink .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , Be@@ hold , evil shall go forth from nation to nation , and a great storm shall be raised up from the utter@@ most parts of the earth .
w@@ ail , you shep@@ herds , and cry ; and wal@@ low in dust , you principal of the flock ; for the days of your slaughter and of your disper@@ sions are fully come , and you shall fall like a goo@@ dly vessel .
he has left his covert , as the lion ; for their land has become an aston@@ ishment because of the fierc@@ eness of the oppression , and because of his fierce anger .
in the beginning of the reign of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jo@@ si@@ ah , king of Jud@@ ah , came this word from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , saying ,
it may be they will listen , and turn every man from his evil way ; that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their do@@ ings .
it happened , when Jer@@ emi@@ ah had made an end of speaking all that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h had commanded him to speak to all the people , that the priests and the prophets and all the people laid hold on him , saying , You shall surely die .
why have you prophe@@ si@@ ed in the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , saying , This house shall be like Sh@@ il@@ oh , and this city shall be des@@ ol@@ ate , without inhabit@@ ant ? all the people were gathered to Jer@@ emi@@ ah in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
then spoke the priests and the prophets to the princes and to all the people , saying , This man is worthy of death ; for he has prophe@@ si@@ ed against this city , as you have heard with your ears .
then spoke Jer@@ emi@@ ah to all the princes and to all the people , saying , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h sent me to proph@@ esy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard .
now therefore amend your ways and your do@@ ings , and obey the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will repent him of the evil that he has pronounced against you .
only know for certain that , if you put me to death , you will bring innocent blood on yourselves , and on this city , and on its inhabitants ; for of a truth Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears .
then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets : this man is not worthy of death ; for he has spoken to us in the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God .
Mic@@ ah the Mor@@ ash@@ tite prophe@@ si@@ ed in the days of He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah ; and he spoke to all the people of Jud@@ ah , saying , Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies : Z@@ ion shall be pl@@ owed as a field , and Jerusalem shall become he@@ aps , and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest .
there was also a man who prophe@@ si@@ ed in the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , Uri@@ ah the son of Sh@@ em@@ aiah of Kiri@@ ath j@@ ear@@ im ; and he prophe@@ si@@ ed against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jer@@ emi@@ ah :
and when Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king , with all his mighty men , and all the princes , heard his words , the king sought to put him to death ; but when Uri@@ ah heard it , he was afraid , and fled , and went into Egypt :
and they fetched forth Uri@@ ah out of Egypt , and brought him to Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king , who killed him with the sword , and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people .
but the hand of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an was with Jer@@ emi@@ ah , that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death .
in the beginning of the reign of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jo@@ si@@ ah , king of Jud@@ ah , came this word to Jer@@ emi@@ ah from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , saying ,
and give them a command to their masters , saying , Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , the God of Israel , You shall tell your masters :
I have made the earth , the men and the animals that are on the surface of the earth , by my great power and by my out@@ stretched arm ; and I give it to whom it seems right to me .
now have I given all these lands into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king of Babylon , my servant ; and the animals of the field also have I given him to serve him .
but as for you , don '@@ t you listen to your prophets , nor to your div@@ in@@ ers , nor to your dreams , nor to your soo@@ th@@ say@@ ers , nor to your sorcer@@ ers , who speak to you , saying , You shall not serve the king of Babylon :
for they proph@@ esy a lie to you , to remove you far from your land , and that I should drive you out , and you should perish .
but the nation that shall bring their neck under the y@@ oke of the king of Babylon , and serve him , that nation will I let remain in their own land , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and they shall till it , and dwell therein .
why will you die , you and your people , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pesti@@ l@@ ence , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon ?
Don '@@ t listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you , saying , You shall not serve the king of Babylon ; for they proph@@ esy a lie to you .
for I have not sent them , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , but they proph@@ esy fal@@ sely in my name ; that I may drive you out , and that you may perish , you , and the prophets who proph@@ esy to you .
Don '@@ t listen to them ; serve the king of Babylon , and live : why should this city become a des@@ ol@@ ation ?
for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies concerning the pillars , and concerning the sea , and concerning the bases , and concerning the resi@@ due of the vessels that are left in this city ,
which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon did@@ n '@@ t take , when he carried away captive J@@ econ@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , king of Jud@@ ah , from Jerusalem to Babylon , and all the no@@ bles of Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem ;
they shall be carried to Babylon , and there shall they be , until the day that I visit them , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; then will I bring them up , and restore them to this place .
it happened the same year , in the beginning of the reign of Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , in the fourth year , in the fifth month , that Han@@ ani@@ ah the son of A@@ zz@@ ur , the prophet , who was of Gi@@ be@@ on , spoke to me in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , in the presence of the priests and of all the people , saying ,
within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's house , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon took away from this place , and carried to Babylon :
and I will bring again to this place J@@ econ@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , king of Jud@@ ah , with all the cap@@ tives of Jud@@ ah , who went to Babylon , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; for I will break the y@@ oke of the king of Babylon .
nevertheless hear you now this word that I speak in your ears , and in the ears of all the people :
the prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophe@@ si@@ ed against many countries , and against great king@@ doms , of war , and of evil , and of pesti@@ l@@ ence .
then Han@@ ani@@ ah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jer@@ emi@@ ah 's neck , and broke it .
Han@@ ani@@ ah spoke in the presence of all the people , saying , Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : even so will I break the y@@ oke of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon within two full years from off the neck of all the nations . the prophet Jer@@ emi@@ ah went his way .
go , and tell Han@@ ani@@ ah , saying , Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : you have broken the bars of wood ; but you have made in their place bars of iron .
then the prophet Jer@@ emi@@ ah said to Han@@ ani@@ ah the prophet , He@@ ar now , Han@@ ani@@ ah : Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has not sent you ; but you make this people to trust in a lie .
therefore thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , Be@@ hold , I will send you away from off the surface of the earth : this year you shall die , because you have spoken rebellion against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
now these are the words of the letter that Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the resi@@ due of the elders of the cap@@ tivity , and to the priests , to the prophets , and to all the people , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon ,
( after that J@@ econ@@ i@@ ah the king , the queen mother , the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , the princes of Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem , the craftsmen , and the s@@ mi@@ ths , had departed from Jerusalem ) ,
by the hand of El@@ as@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and G@@ em@@ ari@@ ah the son of Hil@@ ki@@ ah , ( whom Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah sent to Babylon to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon ) , saying ,
take wives , and father sons and daughters ; and take wives for your sons , and give your daughters to husbands , that they may bear sons and daughters ; and multiply there , and don '@@ t be diminished .
seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive , and pray to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h for it ; for in its peace you shall have peace .
for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , the God of Israel : Don '@@ t let your prophets who are in the midst of you , and your div@@ in@@ ers , deceive you ; neither listen to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies ; Be@@ hold , I will send on them the sword , the famine , and the pesti@@ l@@ ence , and will make them like v@@ ile fi@@ gs , that can '@@ t be eaten , they are so bad .
and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the cap@@ tives of Jud@@ ah who are in Babylon , saying , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h make you like Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah and like A@@ hab , whom the king of Babylon ro@@ asted in the fire ;
because they have worked folly in Israel , and have committed adul@@ tery with their neighbors ' wives , and have spoken words in my name fal@@ sely , which I did@@ n '@@ t command them ; and I am he who knows , and am witness , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
thus speaks Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , the God of Israel , saying , Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are at Jerusalem , and to Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah the son of Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah , the priest , and to all the priests , saying ,
send to all them of the cap@@ tivity , saying , Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h concerning Sh@@ em@@ aiah the Ne@@ hel@@ am@@ ite : because Sh@@ em@@ aiah has prophe@@ si@@ ed to you , and I did@@ n '@@ t send him , and he has caused you to trust in a lie ;
thus speaks Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , saying , Write all the words that I have spoken to you in a book .
for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : we have heard a voice of trembling , of fear , and not of peace .
ask now , and see whether a man does trav@@ ail with child : why do I see every man with his hands on his waist , as a woman in trav@@ ail , and all faces are turned into pal@@ eness ?
alas ! for that day is great , so that none is like it : it is even the time of Jacob 's trouble ; but he shall be saved out of it .
it shall come to pass in that day , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , that I will break his y@@ oke from off your neck , and will burst your bonds ; and strangers shall no more make him their bond@@ servant ;
for I am with you , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to save you : for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you , but I will not make a full end of you ; but I will correct you in measure , and will in no way leave you un@@ punished .
why do you cry for your hurt ? your pain is incur@@ able : for the greatness of your ini@@ qu@@ ity , because your sins were increased , I have done these things to you .
for I will restore health to you , and I will heal you of your wounds , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; because they have called you an out@@ cast , saying , It is Z@@ ion , whom no man seeks after .
their prince shall be of themselves , and their ruler shall proceed from their midst ; and I will cause him to draw near , and he shall approach to me : for who is he who has had bold@@ ness to approach to me ? says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
the fierce anger of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will not return , until he has executed , and until he has performed the intentions of his heart . in the latter days you will understand it .
at that time , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , will I be the God of all the families of Israel , and they shall be my people .
for there shall be a day , that the watch@@ men on the hills of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall cry , A@@ rise , and let us go up to Z@@ ion to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God .
they shall come with we@@ eping ; and with peti@@ tions will I lead them : I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters , in a straight way in which they shall not stum@@ ble ; for I am a father to Israel , and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is my fir@@ st@@ born .
then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance , and the young men and the old together ; for I will turn their mourning into joy , and will comfort them , and make them rejoice from their sorrow .
I will sati@@ ate the soul of the priests with fat@@ ness , and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : a voice is heard in Ram@@ ah , lam@@ entation , and bitter we@@ eping , Rach@@ el we@@ eping for her children ; she refuses to be comfor@@ ted for her children , because they are no more .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : refrain your voice from we@@ eping , and your eyes from tears ; for your work shall be rewarded , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy .
I have surely heard E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im b@@ emo@@ aning himself thus , You have ch@@ asti@@ sed me , and I was ch@@ asti@@ sed , as an un@@ trained cal@@ f : turn me , and I shall be turned ; for you are Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h my God .
surely after that I was turned , I rep@@ ented ; and after that I was instructed , I struck on my thi@@ gh : I was ashamed , yes , even conf@@ ounded , because I bore the repro@@ ach of my youth .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , the God of Israel , Y@@ et again shall they use this speech in the land of Jud@@ ah and in its cities , when I shall bring again their cap@@ tivity : Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h bless you , hab@@ itation of righteousness , mountain of hol@@ iness .
it shall happen that , like as I have watched over them to pl@@ uck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to aff@@ l@@ ict , so will I watch over them to build and to plant , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
behold , the days come , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel , and with the house of Jud@@ ah :
but this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : I will put my law in their inward parts , and in their heart will I write it ; and I will be their God , and they shall be my people :
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , who gives the sun for a light by day , and the ordin@@ ances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night , who stir@@ s up the sea , so that its waves ro@@ ar ; Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies is his name :
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : if heaven above can be measured , and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath , then will I also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
behold , the days come , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that the city shall be built to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h from the tower of Han@@ an@@ el to the gate of the corner .
and Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon , and shall speak with him mouth to mouth , and his eyes shall see his eyes ;
and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Bar@@ uch the son of N@@ eri@@ ah , the son of Mah@@ se@@ i@@ ah , in the presence of Han@@ am@@ el my uncle 's son , and in the presence of the witnesses who subscri@@ bed the deed of the purchase , before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , the God of Israel : take these deeds , this deed of the purchase which is sealed , and this deed which is open , and put them in an ear@@ then vessel ; that they may continue many days .
for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , the God of Israel : houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land .
Ah Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ! behold , you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your out@@ stretched arm ; there is nothing too hard for you ,
who show loving kindness to thousands , and re@@ comp@@ ense the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the fathers into the bos@@ om of their children after them ; the great , the mighty God , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies is his name ;
great in counsel , and mighty in work ; whose eyes are open on all the ways of the sons of men , to give everyone according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his do@@ ings :
therefore thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , I will give this city into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon , and he shall take it :
for this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Jud@@ ah , which they have done to provoke me to anger , they , their kings , their princes , their priests , and their prophets , and the men of Jud@@ ah , and the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
they have turned to me the back , and not the face : and though I taught them , rising up early and teaching them , yet they have not listened to receive instruction .
now therefore thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , concerning this city , about which you say , It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pesti@@ l@@ ence :
behold , I will gather them out of all the countries , where I have driven them in my anger , and in my wrath , and in great indignation ; and I will bring them again to this place , and I will cause them to dwell safely :
and I will make an everlasting covenant with them , that I will not turn away from following them , to do them good ; and I will put my fear in their hearts , that they may not depart from me .
call to me , and I will answer you , and will show you great things , and difficult , which you don '@@ t know .
behold , I will bring it health and cure , and I will cure them ; and I will reveal to them abundance of peace and truth .
I will clean@@ se them from all their ini@@ qu@@ ity , by which they have sin@@ ned against me ; and I will pardon all their ini@@ qu@@ ities , by which they have sin@@ ned against me , and by which they have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies : yet again shall there be in this place , which is waste , without man and without animal , and in all its cities , a hab@@ itation of shep@@ herds causing their f@@ locks to lie down .
behold , the days come , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Jud@@ ah .
in those days shall Jud@@ ah be saved , and Jerusalem shall dwell safely ; and this is the name by which she shall be called : Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our righteousness .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : if you can break my covenant of the day , and my covenant of the night , so that there shall not be day and night in their season ;
the word which came to Jer@@ emi@@ ah from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , when Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon , and all his army , and all the king@@ doms of the earth that were under his dom@@ inion , and all the peoples , were fighting against Jerusalem , and against all the cities of it , saying :
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , Go , and speak to Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , and tell him , Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , Be@@ hold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire :
and you shall not escape out of his hand , but shall surely be taken , and delivered into his hand ; and your eyes shall see the eyes of the king of Babylon , and he shall speak with you mouth to mouth , and you shall go to Babylon .
when the king of Babylon 's army was fighting against Jerusalem , and against all the cities of Jud@@ ah that were left , against L@@ ach@@ ish and against A@@ ze@@ k@@ ah ; for these alone remained of the cities of Jud@@ ah as fortified cities .
that every man should let his male servant , and every man his female servant , who is a Hebrew or a He@@ bre@@ w@@ ess , go free ; that none should make bond@@ servants of them , of a Jew his brother .
but afterwards they turned , and caused the servants and the hand@@ m@@ aids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subj@@ ection for servants and for hand@@ m@@ aids .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel : I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bond@@ age , saying ,
you had now turned , and had done that which is right in my eyes , in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor ; and you had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name :
I will give the men who have trans@@ g@@ ressed my covenant , who have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me , when they cut the cal@@ f in two and passed between its parts ;
Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of those who seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Babylon 's army , who have gone away from you .
behold , I will command , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and cause them to return to this city ; and they shall fight against it , and take it , and burn it with fire : and I will make the cities of Jud@@ ah a des@@ ol@@ ation , without inhabit@@ ant .
the word which came to Jer@@ emi@@ ah from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in the days of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jo@@ si@@ ah , king of Jud@@ ah , saying ,
go to the house of the Rec@@ hab@@ ites , and speak to them , and bring them into the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , into one of the rooms , and give them wine to drink .
then I took Ja@@ az@@ ani@@ ah the son of Jer@@ emi@@ ah , the son of Hab@@ azz@@ ini@@ ah , and his brothers , and all his sons , and the whole house of the Rec@@ hab@@ ites ;
but it happened , when Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon came up into the land , that we said , Come , and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and for fear of the army of the Syrians ; so we dwell at Jerusalem .
because the sons of Jon@@ ad@@ ab the son of Rec@@ hab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them , but this people has not listened to me ;
it happened in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jo@@ si@@ ah , king of Jud@@ ah , that this word came to Jer@@ emi@@ ah from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , saying ,
take a scroll of a book , and write therein all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel , and against Jud@@ ah , and against all the nations , from the day I spoke to you , from the days of Jo@@ si@@ ah , even to this day .
it may be that the house of Jud@@ ah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them ; that they may return every man from his evil way ; that I may forgive their ini@@ qu@@ ity and their sin .
then Jer@@ emi@@ ah called Bar@@ uch the son of N@@ eri@@ ah ; and Bar@@ uch wrote from the mouth of Jer@@ emi@@ ah all the words of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he had spoken to him , on a scroll of a book .
then read Bar@@ uch in the book the words of Jer@@ emi@@ ah in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , in the room of G@@ em@@ ari@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , the scri@@ be , in the upper court , at the entry of the new gate of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's house , in the ears of all the people .
when Mic@@ aiah the son of G@@ em@@ ari@@ ah , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , had heard out of the book all the words of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ,
then Mic@@ aiah declared to them all the words that he had heard , when Bar@@ uch read the book in the ears of the people .
they said to him , S@@ it down now , and read it in our ears . so Bar@@ uch read it in their ears .
now it happened , when they had heard all the words , they turned in fear one toward another , and said to Bar@@ uch , We will surely tell the king of all these words .
so the king sent Je@@ h@@ ud@@ i to get the scroll ; and he took it out of the room of Elis@@ h@@ ama the scri@@ be . Je@@ h@@ ud@@ i read it in the ears of the king , and in the ears of all the princes who stood beside the king .
now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month : and there was a fire in the bra@@ z@@ ier burning before him .
it happened , when Je@@ h@@ ud@@ i had read three or four leaves , that the king cut it with the pen@@ knife , and cast it into the fire that was in the bra@@ z@@ ier , until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the bra@@ z@@ ier .
moreover El@@ na@@ than and Del@@ aiah and G@@ em@@ ari@@ ah had made interc@@ ession to the king that he would not burn the scroll ; but he would not hear them .
the king commanded Jer@@ ah@@ me@@ el the king 's son , and Ser@@ aiah the son of Az@@ riel , and Shel@@ emi@@ ah the son of Ab@@ de@@ el , to take Bar@@ uch the scri@@ be and Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet ; but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h hid them .
therefore thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h concerning Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im king of Jud@@ ah : he shall have none to sit on the throne of David ; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat , and in the night to the frost .
I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their ini@@ qu@@ ity ; and I will bring on them , and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and on the men of Jud@@ ah , all the evil that I have pronounced against them , but they did@@ n '@@ t listen .
Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the son of Jo@@ si@@ ah re@@ igned as king , instead of Con@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon made king in the land of Jud@@ ah .
but neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , listened to the words of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which he spoke by the prophet Jer@@ emi@@ ah .
Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the king sent Je@@ h@@ uc@@ al the son of Shel@@ emi@@ ah , and Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah the son of Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah , the priest , to the prophet Jer@@ emi@@ ah , saying , Pr@@ ay now to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God for us .
Phar@@ aoh 's army had come forth out of Egypt ; and when the Chal@@ de@@ ans who were be@@ sieg@@ ing Jerusalem heard news of them , they broke up from Jerusalem .
it happened that , when the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Phar@@ aoh 's army ,
when he was in the gate of Benjamin , a captain of the guard was there , whose name was I@@ ri@@ jah , the son of Shel@@ emi@@ ah , the son of Han@@ ani@@ ah ; and he laid hold on Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet , saying , You are falling away to the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
then Jer@@ emi@@ ah said , It is false ; I am not falling away to the Chal@@ de@@ ans . but he did@@ n '@@ t listen to him ; so I@@ ri@@ jah laid hold on Jer@@ emi@@ ah , and brought him to the princes .
the princes were angry with Jer@@ emi@@ ah , and struck him , and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scri@@ be ; for they had made that the prison .
when Jer@@ emi@@ ah had come into the dun@@ geon house , and into the cells , and Jer@@ emi@@ ah had remained there many days ;
then Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the king sent , and fetched him : and the king asked him secretly in his house , and said , Is there any word from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ? Jer@@ emi@@ ah said , There is . he said also , You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon .
now please hear , my lord the king : please let my suppl@@ ication be presented before you , that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scri@@ be , lest I die there .
then Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the king commanded , and they committed Jer@@ emi@@ ah into the court of the guard ; and they gave him daily a lo@@ af of bread out of the b@@ akers ' street , until all the bread in the city was spent . thus Jer@@ emi@@ ah remained in the court of the guard .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , He who remains in this city shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pesti@@ l@@ ence ; but he who goes forth to the Chal@@ de@@ ans shall live , and his life shall be to him for a prey , and he shall live .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon , and he shall take it .
then took they Jer@@ emi@@ ah , and cast him into the dun@@ geon of Mal@@ chi@@ jah the king 's son , that was in the court of the guard : and they let down Jer@@ emi@@ ah with cor@@ ds . in the dun@@ geon there was no water , but mire ; and Jer@@ emi@@ ah sank in the mire .
now when E@@ bed@@ m@@ elec@@ h the Ethiopian , a e@@ un@@ uch , who was in the king 's house , heard that they had put Jer@@ emi@@ ah in the dun@@ geon ( the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin ) ,
then the king commanded E@@ bed@@ m@@ elec@@ h the Ethiopian , saying , Take from here thirty men with you , and take up Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet out of the dun@@ geon , before he dies .
so E@@ bed@@ m@@ elec@@ h took the men with him , and went into the house of the king under the treasury , and took there r@@ ags and worn @@@ -@@ @ out garments , and let them down by cor@@ ds into the dun@@ geon to Jer@@ emi@@ ah .
then Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the king sent , and took Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : and the king said to Jer@@ emi@@ ah , I will ask you something . hide nothing from me .
then Jer@@ emi@@ ah said to Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah , If I declare it to you , will you not surely put me to death ? and if I give you counsel , you will not listen to me .
so Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the king s@@ wore secretly to Jer@@ emi@@ ah , saying , As Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lives , who made us this soul , I will not put you to death , neither will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life .
but if you will not go forth to the king of Babylon 's princes , then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and they shall burn it with fire , and you shall not escape out of their hand .
but Jer@@ emi@@ ah said , They shall not deliver you . obey , I beg you , the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , in that which I speak to you : so it shall be well with you , and your soul shall live .
they shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; and you shall not escape out of their hand , but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon : and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire .
then came all the princes to Jer@@ emi@@ ah , and asked him ; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded . so they left off speaking with him ; for the matter was not perceived .
it happened when Jerusalem was taken , ( in the ninth year of Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , in the tenth month , came Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem , and be@@ sieg@@ ed it ;
but the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans pursued after them , and over@@ took Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah in the plains of Jer@@ ich@@ o : and when they had taken him , they brought him up to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon to Ri@@ b@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath ; and he gave judgment on him .
then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah in Ri@@ b@@ lah before his eyes : also the king of Babylon killed all the no@@ bles of Jud@@ ah .
but Ne@@ bu@@ z@@ ar@@ adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , who had nothing , in the land of Jud@@ ah , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time .
they sent , and took Jer@@ emi@@ ah out of the court of the guard , and committed him to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , that he should carry him home : so he lived among the people .
but I will deliver you in that day , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid .
for I will surely save you , and you shall not fall by the sword , but your life shall be for a prey to you ; because you have put your trust in me , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
the word which came to Jer@@ emi@@ ah from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , after that Ne@@ bu@@ z@@ ar@@ adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ram@@ ah , when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the cap@@ tives of Jerusalem and Jud@@ ah , who were carried away captive to Babylon .
G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an s@@ wore to them and to their men , saying , Don '@@ t be afraid to serve the Chal@@ de@@ ans : dwell in the land , and serve the king of Babylon , and it shall be well with you .
likewise when all the Jews who were in Mo@@ ab , and among the children of Am@@ mon , and in E@@ dom , and who were in all the countries , heard that the king of Babylon had left a remn@@ ant of Jud@@ ah , and that he had set over them G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an ;
now it happened in the seventh month , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ ani@@ ah , the son of Elis@@ h@@ ama , of the seed royal and one of the chief officers of the king , and ten men with him , came to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am to M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h ; and there they ate bread together in M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h .
then arose I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ ani@@ ah , and the ten men who were with him , and struck G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an with the sword , and killed him , whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land .
I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ ani@@ ah went forth from M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h to meet them , we@@ eping all along as he went : and it happened , as he met them , he said to them , Come to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am .
but when Johan@@ an the son of Kare@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces who were with him , heard of all the evil that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ ani@@ ah had done ,
then they took all the men , and went to fight with I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ ani@@ ah , and found him by the great waters that are in Gi@@ be@@ on .
and they departed , and lived in Ger@@ u@@ th Ch@@ im@@ ham , which is by Bethlehem , to go to enter into Egypt ,
because of the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; for they were afraid of them , because I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ ani@@ ah had killed G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land .
then all the cap@@ tains of the forces , and Johan@@ an the son of Kare@@ ah , and J@@ ez@@ ani@@ ah the son of Hos@@ ha@@ i@@ ah , and all the people from the least even to the greatest , came near ,
and said to Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet , Please let our suppl@@ ication be presented before you , and pray for us to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God , even for all this remn@@ ant ; for we are left but a few of many , as your eyes do see us :
whether it be good , or whether it be evil , we will obey the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God , to whom we send you ; that it may be well with us , when we obey the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God .
then called he Johan@@ an the son of Kare@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces who were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
if you will still live in this land , then will I build you , and not pull you down , and I will plant you , and not pl@@ uck you up ; for I gri@@ eve over the distress that I have brought on you .
Don '@@ t be afraid of the king of Babylon , of whom you are afraid ; don '@@ t be afraid of him , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : for I am with you to save you , and to deliver you from his hand .
I will grant you mercy , that he may have mercy on you , and cause you to return to your own land .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trum@@ pet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
then it shall happen , that the sword , which you fear , shall over@@ take you there in the land of Egypt ; and the famine , about which you are afraid , shall follow close behind you there in Egypt ; and there you shall die .
and I have this day declared it to you ; but you have not obeyed the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God in anything for which he has sent me to you .
now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pesti@@ l@@ ence , in the place where you desire to go to live there .
it happened that , when Jer@@ emi@@ ah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God , with which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God had sent him to them , even all these words ,
but Bar@@ uch the son of N@@ eri@@ ah sets you on against us , to deliver us into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , that they may put us to death , and carry us away captive to Babylon .
so Johan@@ an the son of Kare@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , and all the people , did@@ n '@@ t obey the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , to dwell in the land of Jud@@ ah .
but Johan@@ an the son of Kare@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , took all the remn@@ ant of Jud@@ ah , who were returned from all the nations where they had been driven , to live in the land of Jud@@ ah ;
and they came into the land of Egypt ; for they did@@ n '@@ t obey the voice of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : and they came to Tah@@ pan@@ hes .
he shall come , and shall strike the land of Egypt ; such as are for death shall be put to death , and such as are for cap@@ tivity to cap@@ tivity , and such as are for the sword to the sword .
the word that came to Jer@@ emi@@ ah concerning all the Jews who lived in the land of Egypt , who lived at M@@ ig@@ dol , and at Tah@@ pan@@ hes , and at M@@ emp@@ his , and in the country of P@@ ath@@ ros , saying ,
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , the God of Israel : you have seen all the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem , and on all the cities of Jud@@ ah ; and behold , this day they are a des@@ ol@@ ation , and no man d@@ wells therein ,
because of their w@@ ick@@ edness which they have committed to provoke me to anger , in that they went to burn inc@@ ense , to serve other gods , that they did@@ n '@@ t know , neither they , nor you , nor your fathers .
therefore my wrath and my anger was poured forth , and was kind@@ led in the cities of Jud@@ ah and in the streets of Jerusalem ; and they are wasted and des@@ ol@@ ate , as it is this day .
therefore thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , the God of Israel : behold , I will set my face against you for evil , even to cut off all Jud@@ ah .
when we burned inc@@ ense to the queen of the sky , and poured out drink offerings to her , did we make her cakes to worship her , and pour out drink offerings to her , without our husbands ?
moreover Jer@@ emi@@ ah said to all the people , and to all the women , He@@ ar the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , all Jud@@ ah who are in the land of Egypt :
behold , I watch over them for evil , and not for good ; and all the men of Jud@@ ah who are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine , until they are all gone .
the message that Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet spoke to Bar@@ uch the son of N@@ eri@@ ah , when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jer@@ emi@@ ah , in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jo@@ si@@ ah , king of Jud@@ ah , saying ,
you shall tell him , Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , that which I have built will I break down , and that which I have planted I will pl@@ uck up ; and this in the whole land .
do you seek great things for yourself ? Don '@@ t seek them ; for , behold , I will bring evil on all flesh , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; but your life will I give to you for a prey in all places where you go .
Don '@@ t let the swift flee away , nor the mighty man escape ; in the north by the river E@@ uph@@ rates have they stum@@ bled and fallen .
Egypt rises up like the Nile , and his waters tos@@ s themselves like the rivers : and he says , I will rise up , I will cover the earth ; I will destroy cities and its inhabitants .
go up , you horses ; and rage , you ch@@ ari@@ ots ; and let the mighty men go forth : C@@ ush and P@@ ut , who handle the shield ; and the Lu@@ dim , who handle and bend the bow .
go up into Gil@@ e@@ ad , and take bal@@ m , virgin daughter of Egypt : in vain do you use many medicines ; there is no healing for you .
the word that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke to Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet , how that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon should come and strike the land of Egypt .
as I live , says the King , whose name is Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , surely like Tab@@ or among the mountains , and like Car@@ me@@ l by the sea , so shall he come .
you daughter who d@@ wells in Egypt , fur@@ nish yourself to go into cap@@ tivity ; for M@@ emp@@ his shall become a des@@ ol@@ ation , and shall be burnt up , without inhabit@@ ant .
also her hired men in the midst of her are like cal@@ ves of the stall ; for they also are turned back , they are fled away together , they did@@ n '@@ t stand : for the day of their calamity has come on them , the time of their vis@@ itation .
the sound of it shall go like the ser@@ pent ; for they shall march with an army , and come against her with axes , as wood cut@@ ters .
they shall cut down her forest , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , though it can '@@ t be searched ; because they are more than the lo@@ cu@@ sts , and are innumerable .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , the God of Israel , says : behold , I will punish Am@@ on of No , and Phar@@ aoh , and Egypt , with her gods , and her kings ; even Phar@@ aoh , and those who trust in him :
and I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives , and into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon , and into the hand of his servants ; and afterwards it shall be inhabited , as in the days of old , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , waters rise up out of the north , and shall become an over@@ flowing stream , and shall over@@ flow the land and all that is therein , the city and those who dwell therein ; and the men shall cry , and all the inhabitants of the land shall w@@ ail .
at the noise of the stam@@ ping of the hoo@@ fs of his strong ones , at the rushing of his ch@@ ari@@ ots , at the rum@@ bling of his wheels , the fathers don '@@ t look back to their children for fee@@ bl@@ eness of hands ;
because of the day that comes to destroy all the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , to cut off from Ty@@ re and Sid@@ on every hel@@ per who remains : for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will destroy the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , the remn@@ ant of the is@@ le of Cap@@ h@@ tor .
you sword of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , how long will it be before you be quiet ? put up yourself into your S@@ cab@@ bard ; rest , and be still .
how can you be quiet , since Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has given you a command ? against Ash@@ kel@@ on , and against the se@@ ash@@ ore , there has he appointed it .
the praise of Mo@@ ab is no more ; in H@@ esh@@ bon they have devised evil against her : come , and let us cut her off from being a nation . you also , mad@@ men , shall be brought to silence : the sword shall pursue you .
the destro@@ yer shall come on every city , and no city shall escape ; the valley also shall perish , and the plain shall be destroyed ; as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken .
give wings to Mo@@ ab , that she may fly and get her away : and her cities shall become a des@@ ol@@ ation , without any to dwell therein .
Mo@@ ab has been at ease from his youth , and he has settled on his le@@ es , and has not been emp@@ tied from vessel to vessel , neither has he gone into cap@@ tivity : therefore his taste remains in him , and his scent is not changed .
Mo@@ ab is laid waste , and they are gone up into his cities , and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter , says the King , whose name is Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies .
all you who are around him , b@@ emo@@ an him , and all you who know his name ; say , How is the strong staff broken , the beautiful rod !
you daughter who d@@ wells in Di@@ bon , come down from your glory , and sit in thirst ; for the destro@@ yer of Mo@@ ab has come up against you , he has destroyed your strongh@@ olds .
Mo@@ ab is disappointed ; for it is broken down : w@@ ail and cry ; tell it by the Ar@@ non , that Mo@@ ab is laid waste .
you inhabitants of Mo@@ ab , leave the cities , and dwell in the rock ; and be like the do@@ ve that makes her nest over the mouth of the abyss .
we have heard of the pride of Mo@@ ab . he is very proud ; his lo@@ ft@@ iness , and his pride , and his arrogance , and the ha@@ u@@ ght@@ iness of his heart .
with more than the we@@ eping of J@@ az@@ er will I we@@ ep for you , vine of Sib@@ ma@@ h : your branches passed over the sea , they reached even to the sea of J@@ az@@ er : on your summer fruits and on your v@@ intage the destro@@ yer is fallen .
gl@@ ad@@ ness and joy is taken away from the fruitful field and from the land of Mo@@ ab ; and I have caused wine to cease from the wine presses : none shall t@@ read with shouting ; the shouting shall be no shouting .
from the cry of H@@ esh@@ bon even to Ele@@ al@@ eh , even to Ja@@ haz have they uttered their voice , from Zo@@ ar even to Hor@@ on@@ aim , to E@@ gl@@ ath Shel@@ is@@ hi@@ yah : for the waters of N@@ im@@ rim also shall become des@@ ol@@ ate .
on all the hous@@ et@@ ops of Mo@@ ab and in its streets there is lam@@ entation every where ; for I have broken Mo@@ ab like a vessel in which none deli@@ ghts , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
K@@ eri@@ o@@ th is taken , and the strongh@@ olds are seized , and the heart of the mighty men of Mo@@ ab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her p@@ ang@@ s .
he who fle@@ es from the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he who gets up out of the pit shall be taken in the sn@@ are : for I will bring on him , even on Mo@@ ab , the year of their vis@@ itation , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
w@@ ail , H@@ esh@@ bon , for A@@ i is laid waste ; cry , you daughters of Rab@@ ba@@ h , clo@@ the yourself in s@@ ack@@ cloth : lam@@ ent , and run back and forth among the fences ; for Mal@@ cam shall go into cap@@ tivity , his priests and his princes together .
flee , turn back , dwell in the depths , inhabitants of D@@ ed@@ an ; for I will bring the calamity of Es@@ au on him , the time that I shall visit him .
but I have made Es@@ au bare , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his seed is destroyed , and his brothers , and his neighbors ; and he is no more .
for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , they to whom it did@@ n '@@ t per@@ tain to drink of the cup shall certainly drink ; and are you he who shall altogether go un@@ punished ? you shall not go un@@ punished , but you shall surely drink .
for I have sworn by myself , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that Bo@@ z@@ rah shall become an aston@@ ishment , a repro@@ ach , a waste , and a curse ; and all its cities shall be perpetual wastes .
I have heard news from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and an ambassador is sent among the nations , saying , G@@ ather yourselves together , and come against her , and rise up to the battle .
the earth trem@@ bles at the noise of their fall ; there is a cry , the noise which is heard in the Red Sea .
behold , he shall come up and fly as the eagle , and spread out his wings against Bo@@ z@@ rah : and the heart of the mighty men of E@@ dom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her p@@ ang@@ s .
of Damascus . Ham@@ ath is conf@@ ounded , and Ar@@ pad ; for they have heard evil news , they are melted away : there is sorrow on the sea ; it can '@@ t be quiet .
therefore her young men shall fall in her streets , and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies .
of K@@ edar , and of the king@@ doms of Haz@@ or , which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon struck . thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : arise , go up to K@@ edar , and destroy the children of the east .
their tents and their f@@ locks shall they take ; they shall carry away for themselves their curtains , and all their vessels , and their cam@@ els ; and they shall cry to them , Terror on every side !
flee , wander far off , dwell in the depths , you inhabitants of Haz@@ or , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; for Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon has taken counsel against you , and has conceived a purpose against you .
arise , go up to a nation that is at ease , that d@@ wells without care , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; that have neither gates nor bars , that dwell alone .
their cam@@ els shall be a boo@@ ty , and the multitude of their livestock a spoil : and I will sc@@ atter to all winds those who have the corners of their be@@ ards cut off ; and I will bring their calamity from every side of them , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h that came to Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet concerning EL@@ AM , in the beginning of the reign of Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , saying ,
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies : behold , I will break the bow of EL@@ AM , the chief of their might .
on EL@@ AM will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of the sky , and will sc@@ atter them toward all those winds ; and there shall be no nation where the out@@ casts of EL@@ AM shall not come .
I will cause EL@@ AM to be dis@@ may@@ ed before their enemies , and before those who seek their life ; and I will bring evil on them , even my fierce anger , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and I will send the sword after them , until I have consumed them ;
the word that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke concerning Babylon , concerning the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , by Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet .
declare among the nations and publish , and set up a standard ; publish , and don '@@ t conceal : say , Babylon is taken , B@@ el is disappointed , Mer@@ od@@ ach is dis@@ may@@ ed ; her images are disappointed , her idols are dis@@ may@@ ed .
for out of the north there comes up a nation against her , which shall make her land des@@ ol@@ ate , and none shall dwell therein : they are fled , they are gone , both man and animal .
in those days , and in that time , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the children of Israel shall come , they and the children of Jud@@ ah together ; they shall go on their way we@@ eping , and shall seek Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God .
my people have been lost sheep : their shep@@ herds have caused them to go astr@@ ay ; they have turned them away on the mountains ; they have gone from mountain to hill ; they have forgotten their resting place .
because you are glad , because you rejoice , O you who pl@@ under my heritage , because you are w@@ ant@@ on as a hei@@ fer that t@@ reads out the grain , and nei@@ gh as strong horses ;
because of the wrath of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h she shall not be inhabited , but she shall be wholly des@@ ol@@ ate : everyone who goes by Babylon shall be astonished , and h@@ iss at all her pl@@ agues .
cut off the s@@ ower from Babylon , and him who handles the sick@@ le in the time of harvest : for fear of the op@@ pressing sword they shall turn everyone to his people , and they shall flee everyone to his own land .
Israel is a hun@@ ted sheep ; the lions have driven him away : first , the king of As@@ sy@@ ria dev@@ oured him ; and now at last Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon has broken his bones .
therefore thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , the God of Israel : behold , I will punish the king of Babylon and his land , as I have punished the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
I will bring Israel again to his past@@ ure , and he shall feed on Car@@ me@@ l and Bash@@ an , and his soul shall be satisfied on the hills of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and in Gil@@ e@@ ad .
in those days , and in that time , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the ini@@ qu@@ ity of Israel shall be sought for , and there shall be none ; and the sins of Jud@@ ah , and they shall not be found : for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remn@@ ant .
go up against the land of Mer@@ ath@@ aim , even against it , and against the inhabitants of Pe@@ k@@ od : kill and utterly destroy after them , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and do according to all that I have commanded you .
I have laid a sn@@ are for you , and you are also taken , Babylon , and you wer@@ en '@@ t aware : you are found , and also caught , because you have stri@@ ven against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
kill all her bul@@ ls ; let them go down to the slaughter : w@@ oe to them ! for their day has come , the time of their vis@@ itation .
the voice of those who flee and escape out of the land of Babylon , to declare in Z@@ ion the vengeance of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God , the vengeance of his temple .
therefore her young men will fall in her streets , and all her men of war will be brought to silence in that day , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
behold , I am against you , you proud one , says the Lord , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies ; for your day has come , the time that I will visit you .
the proud one shall stum@@ ble and fall , and none shall raise him up ; and I will kind@@ le a fire in his cities , and it shall dev@@ our all who are around him .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies : the children of Israel and the children of Jud@@ ah are oppressed together ; and all who took them captive hold them fast ; they refuse to let them go .
their Re@@ deem@@ er is strong ; Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies is his name : he will thoroughly ple@@ ad their cause , that he may give rest to the earth , and dis@@ quiet the inhabitants of Babylon .
a sword is on the Chal@@ de@@ ans , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and on the inhabitants of Babylon , and on her princes , and on her wise men .
a sword is on their horses , and on their ch@@ ari@@ ots , and on all the mixed people who are in the midst of her ; and they shall become as women : a sword is on her treasures , and they shall be robbed .
a drought is on her waters , and they shall be dried up ; for it is a land of engra@@ ved images , and they are mad over idols .
behold , a people comes from the north ; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the utter@@ most parts of the earth .
they lay hold on bow and spe@@ ar ; they are cruel , and have no mercy ; their voice ro@@ ars like the sea ; and they ride on horses , everyone set in array , as a man to the battle , against you , daughter of Babylon .
the king of Babylon has heard the news of them , and his hands wax fee@@ ble : angu@@ ish has taken hold of him , pains as of a woman in labor .
at the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trem@@ bles , and the cry is heard among the nations .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , I will raise up against Babylon , and against those who dwell in Le@@ b@@ kam@@ ai , a destroying wind .
I will send to Babylon strangers , who shall win@@ now her ; and they shall empty her land : for in the day of trouble they shall be against her around .
for Israel is not for@@ s@@ aken , nor Jud@@ ah , of his God , of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies ; though their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and save every man his life ; don '@@ t be cut off in her ini@@ qu@@ ity : for it is the time of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's vengeance ; he will render to her a re@@ comp@@ ense .
we would have healed Babylon , but she is not healed : for@@ sake her , and let us go everyone into his own country ; for her judgment reaches to heaven , and is lifted up even to the skies .
make sharp the arrows ; hold firm the shi@@ elds : Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Med@@ es ; because his purpose is against Babylon , to destroy it : for it is the vengeance of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the vengeance of his temple .
set up a standard against the walls of Babylon , make the watch strong , set the watch@@ men , prepare the amb@@ ushes ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has both pur@@ posed and done that which he spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies has sworn by himself , saying , Su@@ rely I will fill you with men , as with the can@@ ker worm ; and they shall lift up a shout against you .
behold , I am against you , destroying mountain , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , which destroys all the earth ; and I will stretch out my hand on you , and roll you down from the rocks , and will make you a burnt mountain .
they shall not take of you a stone for a corner , nor a stone for foundations ; but you shall be des@@ ol@@ ate for ever , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
set up a standard in the land , blow the trum@@ pet among the nations , prepare the nations against her , call together against her the king@@ doms of Ar@@ ar@@ at , Min@@ ni , and Ash@@ ken@@ az : appoint a marsh@@ al against her ; cause the horses to come up as the rough can@@ ker worm .
prepare against her the nations , the kings of the Med@@ es , its governors , and all its deputies , and all the land of their dom@@ inion .
one runner will run to meet another , and one messenger to meet another , to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken on every quarter :
therefore thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , I will ple@@ ad your cause , and take vengeance for you ; and I will dry up her sea , and make her fountain dry .
when they are heated , I will make their feast , and I will make them drun@@ ken , that they may rejoice , and sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
how is Sh@@ esh@@ ach taken ! and the praise of the whole earth seized ! how is Babylon become a des@@ ol@@ ation among the nations !
her cities are become a des@@ ol@@ ation , a dry land , and a desert , a land in which no man d@@ wells , neither does any son of man pass thereby .
my people , go away from the midst of her , and save yourselves every man from the fierce anger of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
Don '@@ t let your heart faint , neither fear for the news that shall be heard in the land ; for news shall come one year , and after that in another year shall come news , and violence in the land , ruler against ruler .
therefore behold , the days come , that I will execute judgment on the engra@@ ved images of Babylon ; and her whole land shall be conf@@ ounded ; and all her sl@@ ain shall fall in the midst of her .
then the heavens and the earth , and all that is therein , shall sing for joy over Babylon ; for the destroyers shall come to her from the north , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
we are conf@@ ounded , because we have heard repro@@ ach ; confusion has covered our faces : for strangers have come into the sanc@@ tu@@ aries of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's house .
the sound of a cry from Babylon , and of great destruction from the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans !
for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h lays Babylon waste , and destroys out of her the great voice ; and their waves ro@@ ar like many waters ; the noise of their voice is uttered :
for the destro@@ yer has come on her , even on Babylon , and her mighty men are taken , their b@@ ows are broken in pieces ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is a God of re@@ comp@@ enses , he will surely requ@@ ite .
I will make drunk her princes and her wise men , her governors and her deputies , and her mighty men ; and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake up , says the King , whose name is Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies : the broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly overthrown , and her high gates shall be burned with fire ; and the peoples shall labor for van@@ ity , and the nations for the fire ; and they shall be weary .
the word which Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet commanded Ser@@ aiah the son of N@@ eri@@ ah , the son of Mah@@ se@@ i@@ ah , when he went with Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the king of Jud@@ ah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign . now Ser@@ aiah was chief quar@@ ter@@ master .
Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah was twenty @@@ -@@ @ one years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned eleven years in Jerusalem : and his mother 's name was Ham@@ ut@@ al the daughter of Jer@@ emi@@ ah of Lib@@ n@@ ah .
but the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans pursued after the king , and over@@ took Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah in the plains of Jer@@ ich@@ o ; and all his army was scattered from him .
the king of Babylon killed the sons of Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah before his eyes : he killed also all the princes of Jud@@ ah in Ri@@ b@@ lah .
he put out the eyes of Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah ; and the king of Babylon bound him in fet@@ ters , and carried him to Babylon , and put him in prison until the day of his death .
now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which was the nineteenth year of king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar , king of Babylon , came Ne@@ bu@@ z@@ ar@@ adan the captain of the guard , who stood before the king of Babylon , into Jerusalem :
and he burned the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the king 's house ; and all the houses of Jerusalem , even every great house , burned he with fire .
the Chal@@ de@@ ans broke the pillars of brass that were in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in pieces , and carried all the of their brass to Babylon .
they took the two pillars , the one sea , and the twelve bronze bul@@ ls that were under the bases , which king Solomon had made for the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . the brass of all these vessels was without weight .
as for the pillars , the height of the one pillar was eighteen cub@@ its ; and a line of twelve cub@@ its en@@ cir@@ cled it ; and its thickness was four fingers . it was hollow .
a capital of brass was on it ; and the height of the one capital was five cub@@ its , with network and p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates on the capital all around , all of brass : and the second pillar also had like these , and p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates .
there were ninety @@@ -@@ @ six p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates on the sides ; all the p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates were one hundred on the network all around .
the captain of the guard took Ser@@ aiah the chief priest , and Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah the second priest , and the three keepers of the threshold :
the king of Babylon struck them , and put them to death at Ri@@ b@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath . so Jud@@ ah was carried away captive out of his land .
and for his allowance , there was a continual allowance given him by the king of Babylon , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
she we@@ eps bit@@ terly in the night , and her tears are on her cheeks ; among all her lovers she has none to comfort her : all her friends have dealt treach@@ er@@ ously with her ; they are become her enemies .
Jud@@ ah is gone into cap@@ tivity because of afflic@@ tion , and because of great serv@@ itude ; she d@@ wells among the nations , she finds no rest : all her persec@@ utors over@@ took her within the stra@@ its .
the ways of Z@@ ion do mour@@ n , because none come to the solemn assembly ; all her gates are des@@ ol@@ ate , her priests do sigh : her vir@@ gins are afflicted , and she herself is in bitterness .
from the daughter of Z@@ ion all her maj@@ esty is departed : her princes are become like har@@ ts that find no past@@ ure , they are gone without strength before the pursu@@ er .
the adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things : for she has seen that the nations are entered into her sanctuary , concerning whom you commanded that they should not enter into your assembly .
from on high has he sent fire into my bones , and it prevails against them ; He has spread a net for my feet , he has turned me back : he has made me des@@ ol@@ ate and faint all the day .
for these things I we@@ ep ; my eye , my eye runs down with water ; Because the comfor@@ ter who should refresh my soul is far from me : my children are des@@ ol@@ ate , because the enemy has prevailed .
Z@@ ion spreads forth her hands ; there is none to comfort her ; Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has commanded concerning Jacob , that those who are around him should be his adversaries : Jerusalem is among them as an un@@ clean thing .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is righteous ; for I have reb@@ elled against his commandment : please hear all you peoples , and see my sorrow : my vir@@ gins and my young men are gone into cap@@ tivity .
I called for my lovers , but they deceived me : my priests and my elders gave up the spirit in the city , While they sought them food to refresh their souls .
he has bent his bow like an enemy , he has stood with his right hand as an adversary , Has killed all that were pleasant to the eye : in the tent of the daughter of Z@@ ion he has poured out his wrath like fire .
her gates are sunk into the ground ; he has destroyed and broken her bars : her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not ; Yes , her prophets find no vision from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
your prophets have seen for you false and foolish visions ; They have not uncovered your ini@@ qu@@ ity , to bring back your cap@@ tivity , but have seen for you false or@@ acles and causes of ban@@ ishment .
all that pass by cl@@ ap their hands at you . they h@@ iss and wa@@ g their head at the daughter of Jerusalem , saying , Is this the city that men called The perfection of beauty , The joy of the whole earth ?
all your enemies have opened their mouth wide against you ; They h@@ iss and gn@@ ash the teeth ; they say , We have swallowed her up ; Cer@@ tain@@ ly this is the day that we looked for ; we have found , we have seen it .
their heart cried to the Lord : wall of the daughter of Z@@ ion , let tears run down like a river day and night ; Gi@@ ve yourself no resp@@ ite ; don '@@ t let the apple of your eye cease .
the youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets ; My vir@@ gins and my young men are fallen by the sword : you have killed them in the day of your anger ; you have slaughtered , and not p@@ iti@@ ed .
the precious sons of Z@@ ion , comparable to fine gold , How are they este@@ em@@ ed as ear@@ then p@@ itch@@ ers , the work of the hands of the pot@@ ter !
even the jack@@ als draw out the breast , they nurse their young ones : the daughter of my people has become cruel , like the o@@ stric@@ hes in the wilderness .
the tongue of the nursing child cl@@ ings to the roof of his mouth for thirst : the young children ask bread , and no man breaks it to them .
for the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of So@@ dom , That was overthrown as in a moment , and no hands were laid on her .
their appearance is bl@@ acker than a coal ; they are not known in the streets : their skin cl@@ ings to their bones ; it is with@@ ered , it has become like a stick .
the hands of the p@@ iti@@ ful women have boiled their own children ; They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has accomplished his wrath , he has poured out his fierce anger ; He has kind@@ led a fire in Z@@ ion , which has dev@@ oured its foundations .
they wander as blind men in the streets , they are polluted with blood , So that men can '@@ t touch their garments .
our pursu@@ ers were swif@@ ter than the eag@@ les of the sky : they ch@@ ased us on the mountains , they laid wait for us in the wilderness .
the punishment of your ini@@ qu@@ ity is accomplished , daughter of Z@@ ion ; he will no more carry you away into cap@@ tivity : he will visit your ini@@ qu@@ ity , daughter of E@@ dom ; he will un@@ cover your sins .
now it happened in the thir@@ ti@@ eth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth of the month , as I was among the cap@@ tives by the river Che@@ bar , that the heavens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came expressly to E@@ ze@@ ki@@ el the priest , the son of Bu@@ zi , in the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans by the river Che@@ bar ; and the hand of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was there on him .
each one went straight forward : where the spirit was to go , they went ; they did@@ n '@@ t turn when they went .
now as I saw the living creatures , behold , one wheel on the earth beside the living creatures , for each of the four faces of it .
as for their ri@@ ms , they were high and dreadful ; and the four of them had their ri@@ ms full of eyes all around .
when the living creatures went , the wheels went beside them ; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up .
wherever the spirit was to go , they went ; there was the spirit to go : and the wheels were lifted up beside them ; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
when those went , these went ; and when those stood , these stood ; and when those were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up beside them : for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
under the expan@@ se were their wings straight , the one toward the other : each one had two which covered on this side , and every one had two which covered on that side , their bodies .
above the expan@@ se that was over their heads was the lik@@ eness of a throne , as the appearance of a s@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire stone ; and on the lik@@ eness of the throne was a lik@@ eness as the appearance of a man on it above .
he said to me , Son of man , I send you to the children of Israel , to a nation of rebels who have reb@@ elled against me . they and their fathers have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me even to this very day .
they , whether they will hear , or whether they will for@@ bear , ( for they are a rebelli@@ ous house ) , yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them .
you shall speak my words to them , whether they will hear , or whether they will for@@ bear ; for they are most rebelli@@ ous .
he said to me , Son of man , cause your belly to eat , and fill your bow@@ els with this scroll that I give you . then I ate it ; and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth .
for you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language , but to the house of Israel ;
as an adam@@ ant harder than fl@@ int have I made your forehead : Don '@@ t be afraid of them , neither be dis@@ may@@ ed at their looks , though they are a rebelli@@ ous house .
moreover he said to me , Son of man , all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart , and hear with your ears .
then the Spirit lifted me up , and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing , saying , Bless@@ ed be the glory of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h from his place .
so the Spirit lifted me up , and took me away ; and I went in bitterness , in the heat of my spirit ; and the hand of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was strong on me .
son of man , I have made you a watch@@ man to the house of Israel : therefore hear the word from my mouth , and give them warning from me .
and I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth , that you shall be mute , and shall not be to them a repro@@ ver ; for they are a rebelli@@ ous house .
moreover lie on your left side , and lay the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the house of Israel on it ; according to the number of the days that you shall lie on it , you shall bear their ini@@ qu@@ ity .
again , when you have accomplished these , you shall lie on your right side , and shall bear the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the house of Jud@@ ah : forty days , each day for a year , have I appointed it to you .
behold , I lay bands on you , and you shall not turn you from one side to the other , until you have accomplished the days of your siege .
you shall eat it as barley cakes , and you shall b@@ ake it in their sight with d@@ ung that comes out of man .
moreover he said to me , Son of man , behold , I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem : and they shall eat bread by weight , and with fear@@ fulness ; and they shall drink water by measure , and in dis@@ may :
you , son of man , take a sharp sword ; You shall take it as a bar@@ ber 's ra@@ zor to you , and shall cause it to pass on your head and on your beard : then take balances to weigh , and divide the hair .
of these again you shall take , and cast them into the midst of the fire , and burn them in the fire ; from it shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel .
thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : this is Jerusalem ; I have set her in the midst of the nations , and countries are around her .
she has reb@@ elled against my ordin@@ ances in doing w@@ ick@@ edness more than the nations , and against my statutes more than the countries that are around her ; for they have rejected my ordin@@ ances , and as for my statutes , they have not walked in them .
therefore thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , I , even I , am against you ; and I will execute judgments in the midst of you in the sight of the nations .
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of you , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments on you ; and the whole remn@@ ant of you will I sc@@ atter to all the winds .
thus shall my anger be accomplished , and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest , and I shall be comfor@@ ted ; and they shall know that I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have spoken in my zeal , when I have accomplished my wrath on them .
moreover I will make you a des@@ ol@@ ation and a repro@@ ach among the nations that are around you , in the sight of all that pass by .
so it shall be a repro@@ ach and a ta@@ unt , an instruction and an aston@@ ishment , to the nations that are around you , when I shall execute judgments on you in anger and in wrath , and in w@@ ra@@ thful rebu@@ kes ; ( I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it ; )
when I shall send on them the evil arrows of famine , that are for destruction , which I will send to destroy you : and I will increase the famine on you , and will break your staff of bread ;
and I will send on you famine and evil animals , and they shall ber@@ e@@ ave you ; and pesti@@ l@@ ence and blood shall pass through you ; and I will bring the sword on you : I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it .
I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols ; and I will sc@@ atter your bones around your al@@ t@@ ars .
yet will I leave a remn@@ ant , in that you shall have some that escape the sword among the nations , when you shall be scattered through the countries .
thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : strike with your hand , and stamp with your foot , and say , Al@@ as ! because of all the evil ab@@ om@@ inations of the house of Israel ; for they shall fall by the sword , by the famine , and by the pesti@@ l@@ ence .
he who is far off shall die of the pesti@@ l@@ ence ; and he who is near shall fall by the sword ; and he who remains and is be@@ sieg@@ ed shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my wrath on them .
you , son of man , thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to the land of Israel , An end : the end has come on the four corners of the land .
now is the end on you , and I will send my anger on you , and will judge you according to your ways ; and I will bring on you all your ab@@ om@@ inations .
my eye shall not spare you , neither will I have pity ; but I will bring your ways on you , and your ab@@ om@@ inations shall be in the midst of you : and you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
now will I shortly pour out my wrath on you , and accomplish my anger against you , and will judge you according to your ways ; and I will bring on you all your ab@@ om@@ inations .
my eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : I will bring on you according to your ways ; and your ab@@ om@@ inations shall be in the midst of you ; and you shall know that I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , do strike .
the time has come , the day draws near : Don '@@ t let the buyer rejoice , nor the seller mour@@ n ; for wrath is on all its multitude .
for the seller shall not return to that which is sold , although they be yet alive : for the vision is touching the whole multitude of it , none shall return ; neither shall any strengthen himself in the ini@@ qu@@ ity of his life .
they have blown the trum@@ pet , and have made all ready ; but none goes to the battle ; for my wrath is on all its multitude .
the sword is outside , and the pesti@@ l@@ ence and the famine within : he who is in the field shall die with the sword : and he who is in the city , famine and pesti@@ l@@ ence shall dev@@ our him .
but those of those who escape shall escape , and shall be on the mountains like d@@ oves of the valleys , all of them mo@@ aning , every one in his ini@@ qu@@ ity .
as for the beauty of his or@@ nament , he set it in maj@@ esty ; but they made the images of their ab@@ om@@ inations and their det@@ est@@ able things therein : therefore have I made it to them as an un@@ clean thing .
my face will I turn also from them , and they shall prof@@ ane my secret place ; and rob@@ bers shall enter into it , and prof@@ ane it .
mis@@ chief shall come on mis@@ chief , and rum@@ or shall be on rum@@ or ; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet ; but the law shall perish from the priest , and counsel from the elders .
the king shall mour@@ n , and the prince shall be clo@@ thed with des@@ ol@@ ation , and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled : I will do to them after their way , and according to their own judgments will I judge them ; and they shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
it happened in the sixth year , in the sixth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I sat in my house , and the elders of Jud@@ ah sat before me , that the hand of the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h fell there on me .
then I saw , and behold , a lik@@ eness as the appearance of fire ; from the appearance of his waist and downward , fire ; and from his waist and upward , as the appearance of brightness , as it were glowing metal .
then he said to me , Son of man , lift up your eyes now the way toward the north . so I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north , and see , nor@@ th@@ ward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry .
he said to me , Son of man , do you see what they do ? even the great ab@@ om@@ inations that the house of Israel do commit here , that I should go far off from my sanctuary ? but you shall again see yet other great ab@@ om@@ inations .
then he said to me , Son of man , dig now in the wall : and when I had dug in the wall , behold , a door .
so I went in and saw ; and see , every form of cre@@ eping things , and ab@@ om@@ in@@ able animals , and all the idols of the house of Israel , portrayed around on the wall .
there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel ; and in their midst stood Ja@@ az@@ ani@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , every man with his cen@@ ser in his hand ; and the odor of the cloud of inc@@ ense went up .
then he said to me , Son of man , have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark , every man in his rooms of imagery ? for they say , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h do@@ es@@ n '@@ t see us ; Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has for@@ s@@ aken the land .
then he brought me to the door of the gate of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's house which was toward the north ; and see , there sat the women we@@ eping for Tam@@ mu@@ z .
then he said to me , Have you seen this , son of man ? you shall again see yet greater ab@@ om@@ inations than these .
therefore will I also deal in wrath ; my eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity ; and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice , yet will I not hear them .
then he cried in my ears with a loud voice , saying , C@@ ause those who are in charge of the city to draw near , every man with his destroying weapon in his hand .
the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cher@@ u@@ b , where@@ upon it was , to the threshold of the house : and he called to the man clo@@ thed in linen , who had the writer 's ink@@ horn by his side .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to him , Go through the midst of the city , through the midst of Jerusalem , and set a mark on the fore@@ heads of the men that sigh and that cry over all the ab@@ om@@ inations that are done in its midst .
he said to them , Def@@ ile the house , and fill the courts with the sl@@ ain . go forth ! they went forth , and struck in the city .
it happened , while they were sm@@ iting , and I was left , that I fell on my face , and cried , and said , Ah Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ! will you destroy all the resi@@ due of Israel in your pouring out of your wrath on Jerusalem ?
then he said to me , The ini@@ qu@@ ity of the house of Israel and Jud@@ ah is exceedingly great , and the land is full of blood , and the city full of per@@ version : for they say , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has for@@ s@@ aken the land , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h do@@ es@@ n '@@ t see .
as for me also , my eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity , but I will bring their way on their head .
then I looked , and see , in the expan@@ se that was over the head of the cher@@ ub@@ im there appeared above them as it were a s@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire stone , as the appearance of the lik@@ eness of a throne .
now the cher@@ ub@@ im stood on the right side of the house , when the man went in ; and the cloud filled the inner court .
it came to pass , when he commanded the man clo@@ thed in linen , saying , Take fire from between the whir@@ ling wheels , from between the cher@@ ub@@ im , that he went in , and stood beside a wheel .
the cher@@ u@@ b stretched forth his hand from between the cher@@ ub@@ im to the fire that was between the cher@@ ub@@ im , and took of it , and put it into the hands of him who was clo@@ thed in linen , who took it and went out .
I looked , and behold , four wheels beside the cher@@ ub@@ im , one wheel beside one cher@@ u@@ b , and another wheel beside another cher@@ u@@ b ; and the appearance of the wheels was like a ber@@ yl stone .
their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their wings , and the wheels , were full of eyes all around , even the wheels that the four of them had .
when they stood , these stood ; and when they mounted up , these mounted up with them : for the spirit of the living creature was in them .
the Spirit of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h fell on me , and he said to me , Spe@@ ak , Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : thus you have said , house of Israel ; for I know the things that come into your mind .
you have multiplied your sl@@ ain in this city , and you have filled its streets with the sl@@ ain .
therefore thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : your sl@@ ain whom you have laid in its midst , they are the meat , and this is the cal@@ dr@@ on ; but you shall be brought out of its midst .
I will bring you forth out of its midst , and deliver you into the hands of strangers , and will execute judgments among you .
you shall fall by the sword ; I will judge you in the border of Israel ; and you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
and you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : for you have not walked in my statutes , neither have you executed my ordin@@ ances , but have done after the ordin@@ ances of the nations that are around you .
therefore say , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : whereas I have removed them far off among the nations , and whereas I have scattered them among the countries , yet will I be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they have come .
therefore say , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : I will gather you from the peoples , and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered , and I will give you the land of Israel .
I will give them one heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take the st@@ ony heart out of their flesh , and will give them a heart of flesh ;
but as for them whose heart walks after the heart of their det@@ est@@ able things and their ab@@ om@@ inations , I will bring their way on their own heads , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
then the cher@@ ub@@ im lifted up their wings , and the wheels were beside them ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above .
the Spirit lifted me up , and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chal@@ dea , to them of the cap@@ tivity . so the vision that I had seen went up from me .
you shall bring forth your stuff by day in their sight , as stuff for moving ; and you shall go forth yourself at even in their sight , as when men go forth into exile .
the prince who is among them shall bear on his shoulder in the dark , and shall go forth : they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby : he shall cover his face , because he shall not see the land with his eyes .
my net also will I spread on him , and he shall be taken in my sn@@ are ; and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
I will sc@@ atter toward every wind all who are around him to help him , and all his bands ; and I will draw out the sword after them .
they shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , when I shall disper@@ se them among the nations , and sc@@ atter them through the countries .
but I will leave a few men of them from the sword , from the famine , and from the pesti@@ l@@ ence ; that they may declare all their ab@@ om@@ inations among the nations where they come ; and they shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste , and the land shall be a des@@ ol@@ ation ; and you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
tell them therefore , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : I will make this prover@@ b to cease , and they shall no more use it as a prover@@ b in Israel ; but tell them , The days are at hand , and the fulfillment of every vision .
for I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; I will speak , and the word that I shall speak shall be performed ; it shall be no more deferred : for in your days , rebelli@@ ous house , will I speak the word , and will perform it , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
son of man , behold , they of the house of Israel say , The vision that he sees is for many day to come , and he prophe@@ sies of times that are far off .
you have not gone up into the gaps , neither built up the wall for the house of Israel , to stand in the battle in the day of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
they have seen false@@ hood and lying div@@ ination , who say , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h says ; but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has not sent them : and they have made men to hope that the word would be confirmed .
tell those who pl@@ aster it with whit@@ ew@@ ash , that it shall fall : there shall be an over@@ flowing shower ; and you , great ha@@ il@@ stones , shall fall ; and a stor@@ my wind shall tear it .
therefore thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : I will even tear it with a stor@@ my wind in my wrath ; and there shall be an over@@ flowing shower in my anger , and great ha@@ il@@ stones in wrath to consume it .
so will I break down the wall that you have pl@@ ast@@ ered with whit@@ ew@@ ash , and bring it down to the ground , so that its foundation shall be uncovered ; and it shall fall , and you shall be consumed in its midst : and you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
and say , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : w@@ oe to the women who se@@ w pil@@ lows on all el@@ b@@ ows , and make ker@@ chiefs for the head of persons of every stature to hunt souls ! will you hunt the souls of my people , and save souls alive for yourselves ?
you have prof@@ an@@ ed me among my people for hand@@ ful@@ s of barley and for pieces of bread , to kill the souls who should not die , and to save the souls alive who should not live , by your lying to my people who listen to lies .
your ker@@ chiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hun@@ ted ; and you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
because with lies you have griev@@ ed the heart of the righteous , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the wicked , that he should not return from his wicked way , and be saved alive :
son of man , these men have taken their idols into their heart , and put the stumbling block of their ini@@ qu@@ ity before their face : should I be inqui@@ red of at all by them ?
therefore tell the house of Israel , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : return , and turn yourselves from your idols ; and turn away your faces from all your ab@@ om@@ inations .
that the house of Israel may go no more astr@@ ay from me , neither def@@ ile themselves any more with all their trans@@ gres@@ sions ; but that they may be my people , and I may be their God , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
if I cause evil animals to pass through the land , and they rav@@ age it , and it be made des@@ ol@@ ate , so that no man may pass through because of the animals ;
for thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : how much more when I send my four severe judgments on Jerusalem , the sword , and the famine , and the evil animals , and the pesti@@ l@@ ence , to cut off from it man and animal !
therefore thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : as the vine tree among the trees of the forest , which I have given to the fire for fuel , so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
I will set my face against them ; they shall go forth from the fire , but the fire shall dev@@ our them ; and you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , when I set my face against them .
and say , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to Jerusalem : your birth and your birth is of the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite ; the A@@ mor@@ ite was your father , and your mother was a Hit@@ tite .
you also took your beautiful jew@@ els of my gold and of my silver , which I had given you , and made for yourself images of men , and played the pro@@ stitute with them ;
moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters , whom you have borne to me , and you have sacrificed these to them to be dev@@ oured . was your prostitution a small matter ,
you have moreover multiplied your prostitution to the land of merchants , to Chal@@ dea ; and yet you wer@@ en '@@ t satisfied with this .
in that you build your v@@ aulted place at the head of every way , and make your lofty place in every street , and have not been as a pro@@ stitute , in that you scor@@ n pay .
I will also give you into their hand , and they shall throw down your v@@ aulted place , and break down your lofty places ; and they shall strip you of your clothes , and take your beautiful jew@@ els ; and they shall leave you naked and bare .
so will I cause my wrath toward you to rest , and my jealousy shall depart from you , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
you are the daughter of your mother , who lo@@ ath@@ es her husband and her children ; and you are the sister of your sisters , who lo@@ athed their husbands and their children : your mother was a Hit@@ tite , and your father an A@@ mor@@ ite .
behold , this was the ini@@ qu@@ ity of your sister So@@ dom : pride , full@@ ness of bread , and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters ; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and ne@@ edy .
I will turn again their cap@@ tivity , the cap@@ tivity of So@@ dom and her daughters , and the cap@@ tivity of Sam@@ aria and her daughters , and the cap@@ tivity of your cap@@ tives in their midst ;
before your w@@ ick@@ edness was uncovered , as at the time of the repro@@ ach of the daughters of Syria , and of all who are around her , the daughters of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , who do despite to you all around .
for thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : I will also deal with you as you have done , who have desp@@ ised the oath in breaking the covenant .
nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth , and I will establish to you an everlasting covenant .
and say , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : a great eagle with great wings and long fe@@ athers , full of fe@@ athers , which had various colors , came to Lebanon , and took the top of the c@@ edar :
he took also of the seed of the land , and planted it in a fruitful soil ; he placed it beside many waters ; he set it as a wil@@ low tree .
there was also another great eagle with great wings and many fe@@ athers : and behold , this vine bent its roots toward him , and shot forth its branches toward him , from the beds of its plantation , that he might water it .
it was planted in a good soil by many waters , that it might bring forth branches , and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a goo@@ dly vine .
say now to the rebelli@@ ous house , Don '@@ t you know what these things mean ? tell them , Be@@ hold , the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem , and took its king , and its princes , and brought them to him to Babylon :
and he took of the seed royal , and made a covenant with him ; he also brought him under an oath , and took away the mighty of the land ;
that the kingdom might be base , that it might not lift itself up , but that by keeping his covenant it might stand .
as I live , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , surely in the place where the king d@@ wells who made him king , whose oath he desp@@ ised , and whose covenant he broke , even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die .
for he has desp@@ ised the oath by breaking the covenant ; and behold , he had given his hand , and yet has done all these things ; he shall not escape .
therefore thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : as I live , surely my oath that he has desp@@ ised , and my covenant that he has broken , I will even bring it on his own head .
I will spread my net on him , and he shall be taken in my sn@@ are , and I will bring him to Babylon , and will enter into judgment with him there for his t@@ resp@@ ass that he has t@@ resp@@ assed against me .
all his fu@@ gi@@ tives in all his bands shall fall by the sword , and those who remain shall be scattered toward every wind : and you shall know that I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it .
what do you mean , that you use this prover@@ b concerning the land of Israel , saying , The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children 's teeth are set on edge ?
as I live , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , you shall not have [ occasion ] any more to use this prover@@ b in Israel .
behold , all souls are mine ; as the soul of the father , so also the soul of the son is mine : the soul who sins , he shall die .
and has not eaten on the mountains , neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , neither has de@@ filed his neighbor 's wife , neither has come near to a woman in her imp@@ urity ,
he who has not given forth on interest , neither has taken any increase , who has withdrawn his hand from ini@@ qu@@ ity , has executed true justice between man and man ,
has walked in my statutes , and has kept my ordin@@ ances , to deal truly ; he is just , he shall surely live , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
and who does not any of those [ duties ] , but even has eaten on the mountains , and de@@ filed his neighbor 's wife ,
has wrong@@ ed the poor and ne@@ edy , has taken by robbery , has not restored the pledge , and has lifted up his eyes to the idols , has committed ab@@ om@@ ination ,
now , behold , if he fathers a son , who sees all his father 's sins , which he has done , and fears , and does not such like ;
neither has wrong@@ ed any , has not taken anything to pledge , neither has taken by robbery , but has given his bread to the hungry , and has covered the naked with a garment ;
yet you say , Why do@@ es@@ n '@@ t the son bear the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the father ? when the son has done that which is lawful and right , and has kept all my statutes , and has done them , he shall surely live .
but if the wicked turn from all his sins that he has committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked ? says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and not rather that he should return from his way , and live ?
yet you say , The way of the Lord is not equal . hear now , house of Israel : is my way not equal ? are@@ n '@@ t your ways unequal ?
again , when the wicked man turns away from his w@@ ick@@ edness that he has committed , and does that which is lawful and right , he shall save his soul alive .
because he considers , and turns away from all his trans@@ gres@@ sions that he has committed , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
yet the house of Israel says , " The way of the Lord is not fair . " house of Israel , are@@ n '@@ t my ways fair ? are@@ n '@@ t your ways unfair ?
therefore I will judge you , house of Israel , everyone according to his ways , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . return , and turn yourselves from all your trans@@ gres@@ sions ; so ini@@ qu@@ ity shall not be your ruin .
cast away from you all your trans@@ gres@@ sions , in which you have trans@@ g@@ ressed ; and make yourself a new heart and a new spirit : for why will you die , house of Israel ?
for I have no pleasure in the death of him who dies , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : therefore turn yourselves , and live .
and say , What was your mother ? a lion@@ ess : she cou@@ ched among lions , in the midst of the young lions she nourished her c@@ ubs .
she brought up one of her c@@ ubs : he became a young lion , and he learned to catch the prey ; he dev@@ oured men .
he went up and down among the lions ; he became a young lion , and he learned to catch the prey ; he dev@@ oured men .
he knew their palaces , and laid waste their cities ; and the land was des@@ ol@@ ate , and its full@@ ness , because of the noise of his ro@@ aring .
then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces ; and they spread their net over him ; he was taken in their pit .
they put him in a cage with hoo@@ ks , and brought him to the king of Babylon ; they brought him into strongh@@ olds , that his voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel .
your mother was like a vine , in your blood , planted by the waters : it was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters .
it had strong rods for the scep@@ ters of those who bore rule , and their stature was exalted among the thick b@@ ough@@ s , and they were seen in their height with the multitude of their branches .
but it was pl@@ ucked up in fury , it was cast down to the ground , and the east wind dried up its fruit : its strong rods were broken off and with@@ ered ; the fire consumed them .
will you judge them , son of man , will you judge them ? cause them to know the ab@@ om@@ inations of their fathers ;
in that day I s@@ wore to them , to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands .
I said to them , C@@ ast away every man the ab@@ om@@ inations of his eyes , and don '@@ t def@@ ile yourselves with the idols of Egypt ; I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God .
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be prof@@ an@@ ed in the sight of the nations , among which they were , in whose sight I made myself known to them , in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt .
but I worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be prof@@ an@@ ed in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them out .
nevertheless I withdrew my hand , and worked for my name 's sake , that it should not be prof@@ an@@ ed in the sight of the nations , in whose sight I brought them forth .
moreover I s@@ wore to them in the wilderness , that I would sc@@ atter them among the nations , and disper@@ se them through the countries ;
therefore , son of man , speak to the house of Israel , and tell them , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : in this moreover have your fathers bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed me , in that they have committed a t@@ resp@@ ass against me .
therefore tell the house of Israel , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : do you poll@@ ute yourselves in the way of your fathers ? and do you play the pro@@ stitute after their ab@@ om@@ inations ?
and that which comes into your mind shall not be at all , in that you say , We will be as the nations , as the families of the countries , to serve wood and stone .
and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples , and there will I enter into judgment with you face to face .
as a pleasant aroma will I accept you , when I bring you out from the peoples , and gather you out of the countries in which you have been scattered ; and I will be sancti@@ fied in you in the sight of the nations .
there you shall remember your ways , and all your do@@ ings , in which you have polluted yourselves ; and you shall lo@@ a@@ the yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that you have committed .
you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , when I have dealt with you for my name 's sake , not according to your evil ways , nor according to your corrupt do@@ ings , you house of Israel , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
son of man , set your face toward the south , and drop [ your word ] toward the south , and proph@@ esy against the forest of the field in the South ;
son of man , set your face toward Jerusalem , and drop [ your word ] toward the sanc@@ tu@@ aries , and proph@@ esy against the land of Israel ;
and tell the land of Israel , Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , I am against you , and will draw forth my sword out of its she@@ ath , and will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked .
seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked , therefore shall my sword go forth out of its she@@ ath against all flesh from the south to the north :
son of man , proph@@ esy , and say , Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : say , A sword , a sword , it is sharpen@@ ed , and also furb@@ ished ;
it is sharpen@@ ed that it may make a slaughter ; it is furb@@ ished that it may be as lightning : shall we then make mir@@ th ? the rod of my son , it condem@@ ns every tree .
it is given to be furb@@ ished , that it may be handled : the sword , it is sharpen@@ ed , yes , it is furb@@ ished , to give it into the hand of the killer .
cry and w@@ ail , son of man ; for it is on my people , it is on all the princes of Israel : they are delivered over to the sword with my people ; strike therefore on your thi@@ gh .
I have set the threatening sword against all their gates , that their heart may melt , and their stum@@ blings be multiplied : Ah ! it is made as lightning , it is pointed for slaughter .
you shall appoint a way for the sword to come to Rab@@ ba@@ h of the children of Am@@ mon , and to Jud@@ ah in Jerusalem the fortified .
while they see for you false visions , while they divine lies to you , to lay you on the nec@@ ks of the wicked who are deadly wounded , whose day has come in the time of the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the end .
I will pour out my indignation on you ; I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath ; and I will deliver you into the hand of bru@@ tish men , skillful to destroy .
you shall be for fuel to the fire ; your blood shall be in the midst of the land ; you shall be remembered no more : for I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it .
you , son of man , will you judge , will you judge the bloody city ? then cause her to know all her ab@@ om@@ inations .
those who are near , and those who are far from you , shall mo@@ ck you , you infamous one full of tum@@ ult .
slan@@ der@@ ous men have been in you to shed blood ; and in you they have eaten on the mountains : in the midst of you they have committed le@@ w@@ dness .
in you have they uncovered their fathers ' n@@ ak@@ edness ; in you have they hum@@ bled her who was un@@ clean in her imp@@ urity .
in you have they taken bribes to shed blood ; you have taken interest and increase , and you have gre@@ ed@@ ily gained of your neighbors by oppression , and have forgotten me , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
behold , therefore , I have struck my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made , and at your blood which has been in the midst of you .
can your heart endure , or can your hands be strong , in the days that I shall deal with you ? I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it , and will do it .
you shall be prof@@ an@@ ed in yourself , in the sight of the nations ; and you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
son of man , the house of Israel has become d@@ ross to me : all of them are brass and tin and iron and lead , in the midst of the furnace ; they are the d@@ ross of silver .
therefore thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : because you have all become d@@ ross , therefore , behold , I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem .
as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace , so you will be melted in its midst ; and you will know that I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have poured out my wrath on you .
son of man , tell her , You are a land that is not cleans@@ ed , nor rained on in the day of indignation .
her princes in its midst are like wolves ra@@ ven@@ ing the prey , to shed blood , to destroy souls , that they may get dishonest gain .
I sought for a man among them , who should build up the wall , and stand in the gap before me for the land , that I should not destroy it ; but I found none .
therefore have I poured out my indignation on them ; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath : their own way have I brought on their heads , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
and they played the pro@@ stitute in Egypt ; they played the pro@@ stitute in their youth ; there were their breasts pressed , and there was handled the bos@@ om of their vir@@ g@@ inity .
she bestowed her prostitution on them , the cho@@ ic@@ est men of As@@ sy@@ ria all of them ; and on whoever she do@@ ted , with all their idols she de@@ filed herself .
neither has she left her prostitution since [ the days of ] Egypt ; for in her youth they lay with her , and they handled the bos@@ om of her vir@@ g@@ inity ; and they poured out their prostitution on her .
these uncovered her n@@ ak@@ edness ; they took her sons and her daughters ; and her they killed with the sword : and she became a by@@ word among women ; for they executed judgments on her .
dressed with gir@@ dles on their wai@@ sts , with flowing turb@@ ans on their heads , all of them princes to look on , after the lik@@ eness of the Bab@@ yl@@ onians in Chal@@ dea , the land of their birth .
the Bab@@ yl@@ onians came to her into the bed of love , and they de@@ filed her with their prostitution , and she was polluted with them , and her soul was alienated from them .
she do@@ ted on their param@@ ours , whose flesh is as the flesh of don@@ keys , and whose issue is like the issue of horses .
thus you called to memory the le@@ w@@ dness of your youth , in the handling of your bos@@ om by the Egyptians for the breasts of your youth .
therefore , O@@ hol@@ i@@ ba@@ h , thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , I will raise up your lovers against you , from whom your soul is alienated , and I will bring them against you on every side :
the Bab@@ yl@@ onians and all the Chal@@ de@@ ans , Pe@@ k@@ od and Sho@@ a and Ko@@ a , all the As@@ sy@@ rians with them ; desirable young men , governors and rulers all of them , princes and men of renow@@ n , all of them riding on horses .
thus will I make your le@@ w@@ dness to cease from you , and your prostitution [ brought ] from the land of Egypt ; so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them , nor remember Egypt any more .
thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : you will drink of your sister 's cup , which is deep and large ; you will be ridicul@@ ed and held in deri@@ sion ; it contains much .
you shall be filled with drun@@ ken@@ ness and sorrow , with the cup of aston@@ ishment and des@@ ol@@ ation , with the cup of your sister Sam@@ aria .
you shall even drink it and drain it out , and you shall gn@@ aw the broken pieces of it , and shall tear your breasts ; for I have spoken it , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
for when they had sl@@ ain their children to their idols , then they came the same day into my sanctuary to prof@@ ane it ; and behold , thus have they done in the midst of my house .
furthermore you have sent for men who come from far , to whom a messenger was sent , and behold , they came ; for whom you did wash yourself , paint your eyes , and decor@@ ate yourself with ornam@@ ents ,
the voice of a multitude being at ease was with her : and with men of the common sort were brought drun@@ k@@ ards from the wilderness ; and they put brac@@ elets on their hands [ tw@@ ain ] , and beautiful crow@@ ns on their heads .
they went in to her , as they go in to a pro@@ stitute : so went they in to O@@ hol@@ ah and to O@@ hol@@ i@@ ba@@ h , the le@@ w@@ d women .
righteous men , they shall judge them with the judgment of adul@@ ter@@ esses , and with the judgment of women who shed blood ; because they are adul@@ ter@@ esses , and blood is in their hands .
the company shall stone them with stones , and dispatch them with their s@@ words ; they shall kill their sons and their daughters , and burn up their houses with fire .
son of man , write the name of the day , [ even ] of this same day : the king of Babylon drew close to Jerusalem this same day .
utter a parable to the rebelli@@ ous house , and tell them , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , Set on the cal@@ dr@@ on , set it on , and also pour water into it :
gather its pieces into it , even every good piece , the thi@@ gh , and the shoulder ; fill it with the choice bones .
therefore thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : w@@ oe to the bloody city , to the cal@@ dr@@ on whose r@@ ust is therein , and whose r@@ ust is not gone out of it ! take out of it piece after piece ; No lot is fallen on it .
for her blood is in the midst of her ; she set it on the bare rock ; she did@@ n '@@ t pour it on the ground , to cover it with dust .
that it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance , I have set her blood on the bare rock , that it should not be covered .
she has wear@@ ied [ herself ] with to@@ il ; yet her great r@@ ust do@@ es@@ n '@@ t go forth out of her ; her r@@ ust do@@ es@@ n '@@ t [ go forth ] by fire .
I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it : it shall happen , and I will do it : I will not go back , neither will I spare , neither will I repent ; according to your ways , and according to your do@@ ings , shall they judge you , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
son of man , behold , I will take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke : yet you shall neither mour@@ n nor we@@ ep , neither shall your tears run down .
sigh , but not aloud , make no mourning for the dead ; bind your he@@ address on you , and put your shoes on your feet , and don '@@ t cover your lips , and don '@@ t eat men 's bread .
thus E@@ ze@@ ki@@ el shall be a sign to you ; according to all that he has done , you will do . when this comes , then you will know that I am the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
you , son of man , shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength , the joy of their glory , the desire of their eyes , and that where@@ upon they set their heart , their sons and their daughters ,
that in that day he who escap@@ es shall come to you , to cause you to hear it with your ears ?
in that day your mouth will be opened to him who has escaped , and you shall speak , and be no more mute : so you will be a sign to them ; and they shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
therefore , behold , I will deliver you to the children of the east for a possession , and they shall set their enc@@ amp@@ ments in you , and make their dwell@@ ings in you ; they shall eat your fruit , and they shall drink your milk .
I will make Rab@@ ba@@ h a stable for cam@@ els , and the children of Am@@ mon a resting place for f@@ locks : and you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
for thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : because you have cl@@ apped your hands , and stamped with the feet , and rejo@@ iced with all the despite of your soul against the land of Israel ;
therefore , behold , I will open the side of Mo@@ ab from the cities , from his cities which are on his frontiers , the glory of the country , B@@ eth Jes@@ him@@ o@@ th , Ba@@ al Me@@ on , and Kiri@@ ath@@ aim ,
thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : because E@@ dom has dealt against the house of Jud@@ ah by taking vengeance , and has greatly offended , and rev@@ eng@@ ed himself on them ;
I will lay my vengeance on E@@ dom by the hand of my people Israel ; and they shall do in E@@ dom according to my anger and according to my wrath ; and they shall know my vengeance , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
therefore thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , Be@@ hold , I will stretch out my hand on the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and I will cut off the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and destroy the remn@@ ant of the sea coast .
I will execute great vengeance on them with w@@ ra@@ thful rebu@@ kes ; and they shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , when I shall lay my vengeance on them .
son of man , because Ty@@ re has said against Jerusalem , A@@ ha , she is broken : the gate of the peoples ; she is turned to me ; I shall be replen@@ ished , now that she is laid waste :
therefore thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , Be@@ hold , I am against you , Ty@@ re , and will cause many nations to come up against you , as the sea causes its waves to come up .
they shall destroy the walls of Ty@@ re , and break down her towers : I will also sc@@ rape her dust from her , and make her a bare rock .
for thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , I will bring on Ty@@ re Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon , king of kings , from the north , with horses , and with ch@@ ari@@ ots , and with hor@@ sem@@ en , and a company , and many people .
he shall kill your daughters in the field with the sword ; and he shall make for@@ ts against you , and cast up a m@@ ound against you , and raise up the Buck@@ ler against you .
he shall set his batter@@ ing engines against your walls , and with his axes he shall break down your towers .
they shall make a spoil of your riches , and make a prey of your merchandise ; and they shall break down your walls , and destroy your pleasant houses ; and they shall lay your stones and your timber and your dust in the midst of the waters .
I will make you a bare rock ; you shall be a place for the spreading of nets ; you shall be built no more : for I Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h have spoken it , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to Ty@@ re : shall not the islands shake at the sound of your fall , when the wounded gro@@ an , when the slaughter is made in the midst of you ?
they shall take up a lam@@ entation over you , and tell you , How you are destroyed , who were inhabited by seaf@@ aring men , the renowned city , who was strong in the sea , she and her inhabitants , who caused their terror to be on all who lived there !
now shall the islands trem@@ ble in the day of your fall ; yes , the islands that are in the sea shall be dis@@ may@@ ed at your departure .
for thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : when I shall make you a des@@ ol@@ ate city , like the cities that are not inhabited ; when I shall bring up the deep on you , and the great waters shall cover you ;
I will make you a terror , and you shall no more have any being ; though you are sought for , yet you will never be found again , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
and tell Ty@@ re , you who dwell at the entry of the sea , who are the merchant of the peoples to many islands , thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : you , Ty@@ re , have said , I am perfect in beauty .
they have made all your plan@@ ks of f@@ ir trees from Sen@@ ir ; they have taken a c@@ edar from Lebanon to make a m@@ ast for you .
of fine linen with embroi@@ dered work from Egypt was your sail , that it might be to you for a banner ; blue and purple from the islands of Elis@@ ha@@ h was your aw@@ ning .
the old men of Ge@@ bal and the wise men of it were in you your re@@ pair@@ ers of ship se@@ ams : all the ships of the sea with their mar@@ in@@ ers were in you to deal in your merchandise .
the men of Ar@@ v@@ ad with your army were on your walls all around , and val@@ orous men were in your towers ; they han@@ ged their shi@@ elds on your walls all around ; they have perf@@ ected your beauty .
Tar@@ sh@@ ish was your merchant by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches ; with silver , iron , tin , and lead , they traded for your wa@@ res .
Jav@@ an , tu@@ bal , and M@@ esh@@ ech , they were your traffickers ; they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass for your merchandise .
Jud@@ ah , and the land of Israel , they were your traffickers : they traded for your merchandise wheat of Min@@ n@@ ith , and conf@@ ections , and honey , and oil , and bal@@ m .
Damascus was your merchant for the multitude of your han@@ di@@ works , by reason of the multitude of all kinds of riches , with the wine of Hel@@ bon , and white wool .
the traffickers of She@@ ba and Ra@@ am@@ ah , they were your traffickers ; they traded for your wa@@ res with the chief of all spices , and with all precious stones , and gold .
these were your traffickers in choice wa@@ res , in wrap@@ p@@ ings of blue and embroi@@ dered work , and in ch@@ ests of rich clothing , bound with cor@@ ds and made of c@@ edar , among your merchandise .
the ships of Tar@@ sh@@ ish were your car@@ av@@ ans for your merchandise : and you were replen@@ ished , and made very glorious in the heart of the seas .
your rowers have brought you into great waters : the east wind has broken you in the heart of the seas .
and they shall make themselves bal@@ d for you , and clo@@ the them with s@@ ack@@ cloth , and they shall we@@ ep for you in bitterness of soul with bitter mourning .
when your wa@@ res went forth out of the seas , you filled many peoples ; you enriched the kings of the earth with the multitude of your riches and of your merchandise .
therefore , behold , I will bring strangers on you , the terrible of the nations ; and they shall draw their s@@ words against the beauty of your wisdom , and they shall def@@ ile your brightness .
will you yet say before him who kills you , I am God ? but you are man , and not God , in the hand of him who wounds you .
you shall die the death of the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised by the hand of strangers : for I have spoken it , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
by the abundance of your traffic they filled the midst of you with violence , and you have sin@@ ned : therefore I have cast you as prof@@ ane out of the mountain of God ; and I have destroyed you , covering cher@@ u@@ b , from the midst of the stones of fire .
your heart was lifted up because of your beauty ; you have corrupted your wisdom by reason of your brightness : I have cast you to the ground ; I have laid you before kings , that they may see you .
all those who know you among the peoples shall be astonished at you : you have become a terror , and you shall n@@ ever@@ more have any being .
and say , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , I am against you , Sid@@ on ; and I will be glori@@ fied in the midst of you ; and they shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , when I shall have executed judgments in her , and shall be sancti@@ fied in her .
for I will send pesti@@ l@@ ence into her , and blood into her streets ; and the wounded shall fall in the midst of her , with the sword on her on every side ; and they shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
there shall be no more a pr@@ icking bri@@ er to the house of Israel , nor a hurting thor@@ n of any that are around them , that scor@@ ned them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : when I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered , and shall be sancti@@ fied in them in the sight of the nations , then shall they dwell in their own land which I gave to my servant Jacob .
they shall dwell securely therein ; yes , they shall build houses , and plant vineyards , and shall dwell securely , when I have executed judgments on all those who do them despite all around them ; and they shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God .
in the tenth year , in the tenth month , on the twel@@ fth day of the month , the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came to me , saying ,
I will put hoo@@ ks in your j@@ aws , and I will make the fish of your rivers stick to your scales ; and I will bring you up out of the midst of your rivers , with all the fish of your rivers which stick to your scales .
all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , because they have been a staff of re@@ ed to the house of Israel .
when they took hold of you by your hand , you broke , and t@@ ore all their shoulders ; and when they leaned on you , you broke , and paralyzed all of their thi@@ gh@@ s . "
therefore thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : " behold , I will bring a sword on you , and will cut off man and animal from you .
the land of Egypt shall be a des@@ ol@@ ation and a waste ; and they shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . because he has said , ' The river is mine , and I have made it ; '
therefore thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , I will give the land of Egypt to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon ; and he shall carry off her multitude , and take her spoil , and take her prey ; and it shall be the wages for his army .
a sword shall come on Egypt , and angu@@ ish shall be in Ethiopia , when the sl@@ ain shall fall in Egypt ; and they shall take away her multitude , and her foundations shall be broken down .
Ethiopia , and P@@ ut , and Lu@@ d , and all the mixed people , and cu@@ b , and the children of the land that is allied with them , shall fall with them by the sword .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : they also who uphold Egypt shall fall ; and the pride of her power shall come down : from the tower of Sev@@ en@@ eh shall they fall in it by the sword , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
in that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships to make the ca@@ reless Ethiop@@ ians afraid ; and there shall be angu@@ ish on them , as in the day of Egypt ; for , behold , it comes .
he and his people with him , the terrible of the nations , shall be brought in to destroy the land ; and they shall draw their s@@ words against Egypt , and fill the land with the sl@@ ain .
I will make P@@ ath@@ ros des@@ ol@@ ate , and will set a fire in Zo@@ an , and will execute judgments on No .
I will pour my wrath on S@@ in , the strongh@@ old of Egypt ; and I will cut off the multitude of No .
therefore thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , I am against Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt , and will break his arms , the strong [ arm ] , and that which was broken ; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand .
I will sc@@ atter the Egyptians among the nations , and disper@@ se them through the countries ; and they shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
behold , the As@@ sy@@ rian was a c@@ edar in Lebanon with beautiful branches , and with a forest @@@ -@@ @ like shade , and of high stature ; and its top was among the thick b@@ ough@@ s .
all the birds of the sky made their ne@@ sts in its b@@ ough@@ s ; and under its branches all the animals of the field brought forth their young ; and all great nations lived under its shadow .
the c@@ ed@@ ars in the garden of God could not hide it ; the f@@ ir trees were not like its b@@ ough@@ s , and the plane trees were not as its branches ; nor was any tree in the garden of God like it in its beauty .
I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations ; he shall surely deal with him ; I have driven him out for his w@@ ick@@ edness .
thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : I will spread out my net on you with a company of many peoples ; and they shall bring you up in my net .
when I shall extingu@@ ish you , I will cover the heavens , and make its stars dark ; I will cover the sun with a cloud , and the moon shall not give its light .
I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples , when I shall bring your destruction among the nations , into the countries which you have not known .
yes , I will make many peoples amazed at you , and their kings shall be horri@@ bly afraid for you , when I shall bran@@ dish my sword before them ; and they shall trem@@ ble at every moment , every man for his own life , in the day of your fall .
for thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : the sword of the king of Babylon shall come on you .
when I shall make the land of Egypt des@@ ol@@ ate and waste , a land des@@ tit@@ ute of that of which it was full , when I shall strike all those who dwell therein , then shall they know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
this is the lam@@ entation with which they shall lam@@ ent ; the daughters of the nations shall lam@@ ent there@@ with ; over Egypt , and over all her multitude , shall they lam@@ ent there@@ with , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
As@@ sh@@ ur is there and all her company ; her graves are all around her ; all of them sl@@ ain , fallen by the sword ;
whose graves are set in the utter@@ most parts of the pit , and her company is around her grave ; all of them sl@@ ain , fallen by the sword , who caused terror in the land of the living .
there is M@@ esh@@ ech , tu@@ bal , and all their multitude ; their graves are around them ; all of them un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , sl@@ ain by the sword ; for they caused their terror in the land of the living .
there is E@@ dom , her kings and all her princes , who in their might are laid with those who are sl@@ ain by the sword : they shall lie with the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , and with those who go down to the pit .
Phar@@ aoh shall see them , and shall be comfor@@ ted over all his multitude , even Phar@@ aoh and all his army , sl@@ ain by the sword , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
he heard the sound of the trum@@ pet , and did@@ n '@@ t take warning ; his blood shall be on him ; whereas if he had taken warning , he would have delivered his soul .
so you , son of man , I have set you a watch@@ man to the house of Israel ; therefore hear the word at my mouth , and give them warning from me .
when I tell the righteous , that he shall surely live ; if he trust to his righteousness , and commit ini@@ qu@@ ity , none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered ; but in his ini@@ qu@@ ity that he has committed , therein shall he die .
again , when I say to the wicked , You shall surely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is lawful and right ;
if the wicked restore the pledge , give again that which he had taken by robbery , walk in the statutes of life , committing no ini@@ qu@@ ity ; he shall surely live , he shall not die .
therefore tell them , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : you eat with the blood , and lift up your eyes to your idols , and shed blood : and shall you possess the land ?
you stand on your sword , you work ab@@ om@@ ination , and every one of you de@@ files his neighbor 's wife : and shall you possess the land ?
I will make the land a des@@ ol@@ ation and an aston@@ ishment ; and the pride of her power shall cease ; and the mountains of Israel shall be des@@ ol@@ ate , so that none shall pass through .
then shall they know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , when I have made the land a des@@ ol@@ ation and an aston@@ ishment , because of all their ab@@ om@@ inations which they have committed .
as for you , son of man , the children of your people talk of you by the walls and in the doors of the houses , and speak one to another , everyone to his brother , saying , Please come and hear what is the word that comes forth from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
behold , you are to them as a very lovely song of one who has a pleasant voice , and can play well on an instrument ; for they hear your words , but they don '@@ t do them .
son of man , proph@@ esy against the shep@@ herds of Israel , proph@@ esy , and tell them , even to the shep@@ herds , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : w@@ oe to the shep@@ herds of Israel who feed themselves ! Sh@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t the shep@@ herds feed the sheep ?
as a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered abroad , so will I seek out my sheep ; and I will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day .
I will bring them out from the peoples , and gather them from the countries , and will bring them into their own land ; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel , by the water@@ courses , and in all the inhabited places of the country .
I will feed them with good past@@ ure ; and on the mountains of the height of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie down in a good fold ; and on fat past@@ ure shall they feed on the mountains of Israel .
as for my sheep , they eat that which you have tro@@ dden with your feet , and they drink that which you have f@@ ou@@ led with your feet .
therefore thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to them : behold , I , even I , will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep .
I will set up one shepherd over them , and he shall feed them , even my servant David ; he shall feed them , and he shall be their shepherd .
I will make with them a covenant of peace , and will cause evil animals to cease out of the land ; and they shall dwell securely in the wilderness , and sleep in the woods .
they shall no more be a prey to the nations , neither shall the animals of the earth dev@@ our them ; but they shall dwell securely , and none shall make them afraid .
they shall know that I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , their God am with them , and that they , the house of Israel , are my people , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
and tell it , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , I am against you , Mount Se@@ ir , and I will stretch out my hand against you , and I will make you a des@@ ol@@ ation and an aston@@ ishment .
I will fill its mountains with its sl@@ ain : in your hills and in your valleys and in all your water@@ courses shall they fall who are sl@@ ain with the sword .
you shall know that I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have heard all your insul@@ ts which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel , saying , They are laid des@@ ol@@ ate , they have been given us to dev@@ our .
you have magni@@ fied yourselves against me with your mouth , and have multiplied your words against me : I have heard it .
as you rejo@@ iced over the inheritance of the house of Israel , because it was des@@ ol@@ ate , so will I do to you : you shall be des@@ ol@@ ate , Mount Se@@ ir , and all E@@ dom , even all of it ; and they shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
you , son of man , proph@@ esy to the mountains of Israel , and say , You mountains of Israel , hear the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
but you , mountains of Israel , you shall shoot forth your branches , and yield your fruit to my people Israel ; for they are at hand to come .
yes , I will cause men to walk on you , even my people Israel ; and they shall possess you , and you shall be their inheritance , and you shall no more h@@ ence@@ forth ber@@ e@@ ave them of children .
neither will I let you hear any more the shame of the nations , neither shall you bear the repro@@ ach of the peoples any more , neither shall you cause your nation to stum@@ ble any more , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
son of man , when the house of Israel lived in their own land , they de@@ filed it by their way and by their do@@ ings : their way before me was as the un@@ clean@@ ness of a woman in her imp@@ urity .
and I scattered them among the nations , and they were dispersed through the countries : according to their way and according to their do@@ ings I judged them .
when they came to the nations , where they went , they prof@@ an@@ ed my holy name ; in that men said of them , These are the people of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and are gone forth out of his land .
but I had respect for my holy name , which the house of Israel had prof@@ an@@ ed among the nations , where they went .
therefore tell the house of Israel , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : I don '@@ t do [ this ] for your sake , house of Israel , but for my holy name , which you have prof@@ an@@ ed among the nations , where you went .
I will sancti@@ fy my great name , which has been prof@@ an@@ ed among the nations , which you have prof@@ an@@ ed in their midst ; and the nations shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , when I shall be sancti@@ fied in you before their eyes .
for I will take you from among the nations , and gather you out of all the countries , and will bring you into your own land .
I will sprink@@ le clean water on you , and you shall be clean : from all your fil@@ thiness , and from all your idols , will I clean@@ se you .
I will save you from all your un@@ clean@@ ness : and I will call for the grain , and will multiply it , and lay no famine on you .
I will multiply the fruit of the tree , and the increase of the field , that you may receive no more the repro@@ ach of famine among the nations .
then you shall remember your evil ways , and your do@@ ings that were not good ; and you shall lo@@ a@@ the yourselves in your own sight for your ini@@ qu@@ ities and for your ab@@ om@@ inations .
nor for your sake do I [ this ] , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , be it known to you : be ashamed and conf@@ ounded for your ways , house of Israel .
thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : in the day that I clean@@ se you from all your ini@@ qu@@ ities , I will cause the cities to be inhabited , and the waste places shall be built .
then the nations that are left around you shall know that I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have built the ruined places , and planted that which was des@@ ol@@ ate : I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it , and I will do it .
as the flock for sacrifice , as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed fe@@ asts , so shall the waste cities be filled with f@@ locks of men ; and they shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
he caused me to pass by them all around : and behold , there were very many in the open valley ; and behold , they were very dry .
thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to these bones : behold , I will cause breath to enter into you , and you shall live .
I will lay sin@@ ews on you , and will bring up flesh on you , and cover you with skin , and put breath in you , and you shall live ; and you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
then he said to me , Proph@@ esy to the wind , proph@@ esy , son of man , and tell the wind , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : come from the four winds , breath , and breathe on these sl@@ ain , that they may live .
then he said to me , Son of man , these bones are the whole house of Israel : behold , they say , Our bones are dried up , and our hope is lost ; we are clean cut off .
therefore proph@@ esy , and tell them , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , I will open your graves , and cause you to come up out of your graves , my people ; and I will bring you into the land of Israel .
you shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , when I have opened your graves , and caused you to come up out of your graves , my people .
I will put my Spirit in you , and you shall live , and I will place you in your own land : and you shall know that I , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , have spoken it and performed it , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
say to them , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : behold , I will take the children of Israel from among the nations , where they are gone , and will gather them on every side , and bring them into their own land :
and I will make them one nation in the land , on the mountains of Israel ; and one king shall be king to them all ; and they shall be no more two nations , neither shall they be divided into two king@@ doms any more at all ;
they shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant , in which your fathers lived ; and they shall dwell therein , they , and their children , and their children 's children , forever : and David my servant shall be their prince for ever .
moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them ; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them ; and I will place them , and multiply them , and will set my sanctuary in their midst fore@@ ver@@ more .
son of man , set your face toward Go@@ g , of the land of Mag@@ og , the prince of Ros@@ h , M@@ esh@@ ech , and tu@@ bal , and proph@@ esy against him ,
and I will turn you around , and put hoo@@ ks into your j@@ aws , and I will bring you forth , with all your army , horses and hor@@ sem@@ en , all of them clo@@ thed in full armor , a great company with Buck@@ ler and shield , all of them handling s@@ words ;
Gom@@ er , and all his hor@@ des ; the house of Tog@@ ar@@ ma@@ h in the utter@@ most parts of the north , and all his hor@@ des ; even many peoples with you .
be prepared , yes , prepare yourself , you , and all your companies who are assembled to you , and be a guard to them .
you shall asc@@ end , you shall come like a storm , you shall be like a cloud to cover the land , you , and all your hor@@ des , and many peoples with you .
and you shall say , I will go up to the land of un@@ w@@ alled villages ; I will go to those who are at rest , who dwell securely , all of them dwelling without walls , and having neither bars nor gates ;
you shall come from your place out of the utter@@ most parts of the north , you , and many peoples with you , all of them riding on horses , a great company and a mighty army ;
it shall happen in that day , when Go@@ g shall come against the land of Israel , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , that my wrath shall come up into my no@@ str@@ ils .
for in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken , Su@@ rely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel ;
I will call for a sword against him to all my mountains , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : every man 's sword shall be against his brother .
with pesti@@ l@@ ence and with blood will I enter into judgment with him ; and I will rain on him , and on his hor@@ des , and on the many peoples who are with him , an over@@ flowing shower , and great ha@@ il@@ stones , fire , and sulfur .
I will magni@@ fy myself , and sancti@@ fy myself , and I will make myself known in the eyes of many nations ; and they shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
and I will strike your bow out of your left hand , and will cause your arrows to fall out of your right hand .
I will send a fire on Mag@@ og , and on those who dwell securely in the islands ; and they shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
my holy name will I make known in the midst of my people Israel ; neither will I allow my holy name to be prof@@ an@@ ed any more : and the nations shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the Holy One in Israel .
yes , all the people of the land shall bury them ; and it shall be to them a renow@@ n in the day that I shall be glori@@ fied , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
you shall eat fat until you be full , and drink blood until you are drunk , of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you .
you shall be filled at my table with horses and ch@@ ari@@ ots , with mighty men , and with all men of war , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
when I have brought them back from the peoples , and gathered them out of their enemies ' lands , and am sancti@@ fied in them in the sight of many nations .
they shall know that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God , in that I caused them to go into cap@@ tivity among the nations , and have gathered them to their own land ; and I will leave none of them any more there ;
in the five and twentieth year of our cap@@ tivity , in the beginning of the year , in the tenth [ day ] of the month , in the four@@ teenth year after that the city was struck , in the same day , the hand of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was on me , and he brought me there .
in the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel , and set me down on a very high mountain , where@@ on was as it were the frame of a city on the south .
he brought me there ; and , behold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of brass , with a line of fla@@ x in his hand , and a measuring re@@ ed ; and he stood in the gate .
then came he to the gate which looks toward the east , and went up its steps : and he measured the threshold of the gate , one re@@ ed broad ; and the other threshold , one re@@ ed broad .
every lodge was one re@@ ed long , and one re@@ ed broad ; and [ the space ] between the lo@@ dges was five cub@@ its ; and the threshold of the gate by the por@@ ch of the gate toward the house was one re@@ ed .
then measured he the por@@ ch of the gate , eight cub@@ its ; and its posts , two cub@@ its ; and the por@@ ch of the gate was toward the house .
the lo@@ dges of the gate eastward were three on this side , and three on that side ; they three were of one measure : and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side .
and a border before the lo@@ dges , one cub@@ it [ on this side ] , and a border , one cub@@ it on that side ; and the lo@@ dges , six cub@@ its on this side , and six cub@@ its on that side .
he measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other , a breadth of twenty @@@ -@@ @ five cub@@ its ; door against door .
there were closed windows to the lo@@ dges , and to their posts within the gate all around , and likewise to the arch@@ es ; and windows were around inward ; and on [ each ] post were palm trees .
then brought he me into the outer court ; and behold , there were rooms and a pav@@ ement , made for the court all around : thirty rooms were on the pav@@ ement .
the pav@@ ement was by the side of the gates , answ@@ er@@ able to the length of the gates , even the lower pav@@ ement .
the gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north , he measured its length and its breadth .
the windows of it , and its arch@@ es , and the palm trees of it , were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east ; and they went up to it by seven steps ; and its arch@@ es were before them .
there were seven steps to go up to it , and its arch@@ es were before them ; and it had palm trees , one on this side , and another on that side , on its posts .
there was a gate to the inner court toward the south : and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cub@@ its .
the arch@@ es of it were toward the outer court ; and palm trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the ascent to it had eight steps .
the posts of it were toward the outer court ; and palm trees were on its posts , on this side , and on that side : and the ascent to it had eight steps .
four tables were on this side , and four tables on that side , by the side of the gate ; eight tables , where@@ upon they killed [ the sacrifices ] .
outside of the inner gate were rooms for the singers in the inner court , which was at the side of the north gate ; and their prospect was toward the south ; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north .
and the room whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests , the keepers of the duty of the altar : these are the sons of Z@@ ad@@ ok , who from among the sons of Lev@@ i come near to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to minister to him .
then he brought me to the por@@ ch of the house , and measured each post of the por@@ ch , five cub@@ its on this side , and five cub@@ its on that side : and the breadth of the gate was three cub@@ its on this side , and three cub@@ its on that side .
the length of the por@@ ch was twenty cub@@ its , and the breadth eleven cub@@ its ; even by the steps by which they went up to it : and there were pillars by the posts , one on this side , and another on that side .
he brought me to the temple , and measured the posts , six cub@@ its broad on the one side , and six cub@@ its broad on the other side , which was the breadth of the tent .
then went he inward , and measured each post of the entrance , two cub@@ its ; and the entrance , six cub@@ its ; and the breadth of the entrance , seven cub@@ its .
he measured its length , twenty cub@@ its , and the breadth , twenty cub@@ its , before the temple : and he said to me , This is the most holy place .
then he measured the wall of the house , six cub@@ its ; and the breadth of every side room , four cub@@ its , all around the house on every side .
the building that was before the separate place at the side toward the west was seventy cub@@ its broad ; and the wall of the building was five cub@@ its thick all around , and its length ninety cub@@ its .
he measured the length of the building before the separate place which was at its back , and its galleries on the one side and on the other side , one hundred cub@@ its ; and the inner temple , and the por@@ ches of the court ;
to [ the space ] above the door , even to the inner house , and outside , and by all the wall all around inside and outside , by measure .
the doors had two leaves [ api@@ ece ] , two turning leaves : two [ leaves ] for the one door , and two leaves for the other .
there were made on them , on the doors of the temple , cher@@ ub@@ im and palm trees , like as were made on the walls ; and there was a threshold of wood on the face of the por@@ ch outside .
there were closed windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the por@@ ch : thus were the side rooms of the house , and the thresholds .
before the rooms was a walk of ten cub@@ its ' breadth inward , a way of one cub@@ it ; and their doors were toward the north .
for they were in three stories , and they did@@ n '@@ t have pillars as the pillars of the courts : therefore [ the up@@ per@@ most ] was stra@@ it@@ ened more than the lowest and the middle from the ground .
the wall that was outside by the side of the rooms , toward the outer court before the rooms , its length was fifty cub@@ its .
for the length of the rooms that were in the outer court was fifty cub@@ its : and behold , before the temple were one hundred cub@@ its .
according to the doors of the rooms that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way , even the way directly before the wall toward the east , as one enters into them .
he measured on the east side with the measuring re@@ ed five hundred re@@ eds , with the measuring re@@ ed all around .
he measured it on the four sides : it had a wall around it , the length five hundred , and the breadth five hundred , to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common .
behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like the sound of many waters ; and the earth sh@@ ined with his glory .
the glory of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east .
now let them put away their prostitution , and the dead bodies of their kings , far from me ; and I will dwell in their midst forever .
you , son of man , show the house to the house of Israel , that they may be ashamed of their ini@@ qu@@ ities ; and let them measure the pattern .
the upper altar shall be four cub@@ its ; and from the altar hear@@ th and upward there shall be four horns .
the altar hear@@ th shall be twelve [ cub@@ its ] long by twelve broad , square in the four sides of it .
the ledge shall be fourteen [ cub@@ its ] long by fourteen broad in the four sides of it ; and the border about it shall be half a cub@@ it ; and its bottom shall be a cub@@ it around ; and its steps shall look toward the east .
he said to me , Son of man , thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : these are the ordin@@ ances of the altar in the day when they shall make it , to offer burnt offerings there@@ on , and to sprink@@ le blood there@@ on .
you shall give to the priests the Lev@@ ites who are of the seed of Z@@ ad@@ ok , who are near to me , to minister to me , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , a young bull for a sin offering .
you shall take of its blood , and put it on the four horns of it , and on the four corners of the ledge , and on the border all around : thus you shall clean@@ se it and make at@@ onement for it .
when you have finished cleansing it , you shall offer a young bull without bl@@ emish , and a ram out of the flock without bl@@ emish .
you shall bring them near to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and the priests shall cast salt on them , and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
when they have accomplished the days , it shall be that on the eighth day , and forward , the priests shall make your burnt offerings on the altar , and your peace offerings ; and I will accept you , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary , which looks toward the east ; and it was shut .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to me , This gate shall be shut ; it shall not be opened , neither shall any man enter in by it ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , has entered in by it ; therefore it shall be shut .
as for the prince , he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; he shall enter by the way of the por@@ ch of the gate , and shall go out by the way of the same .
then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house ; and I looked , and behold , the glory of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h filled the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : and I fell on my face .
you shall tell the rebelli@@ ous , even to the house of Israel , Th@@ us says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : you house of Israel , let it suffice you of all your ab@@ om@@ inations ,
you have not performed the duty of my holy things ; but you have set performers of my duty in my sanctuary for yourselves .
yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary , having oversight at the gates of the house , and minist@@ ering in the house : they shall kill the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people , and they shall stand before them to minister to them .
because they minist@@ ered to them before their idols , and became a stumbling block of ini@@ qu@@ ity to the house of Israel ; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and they shall bear their ini@@ qu@@ ity .
they shall enter into my sanctuary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister to me , and they shall keep my instruction .
neither shall they take for their wives a widow , nor her who is put away ; but they shall take vir@@ gins of the seed of the house of Israel , or a widow who is the widow of a priest .
they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and the common , and cause them to discern between the un@@ clean and the clean .
in a controversy they shall stand to judge ; according to my ordin@@ ances shall they judge it : and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my appointed fe@@ asts ; and they shall make my Sab@@ baths holy .
of this measure you shall measure a length of twenty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand , and a breadth of ten thousand : and in it shall be the sanctuary , which is most holy .
you shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad , and twenty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand long , side by side with the offering of the holy portion : it shall be for the whole house of Israel .
the ep@@ ha@@ h and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain the tenth part of a Hom@@ er , and the ep@@ ha@@ h the tenth part of a Hom@@ er : its measure shall be after the Hom@@ er .
and one lamb of the flock , out of two hundred , from the well @@@ -@@ @ wat@@ ered past@@ ures of Israel@@ -@@ -@@ for a meal offering , and for a burnt offering , and for peace offerings , to make at@@ onement for them , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : in the first [ month ] , in the first [ day ] of the month , you shall take a young bull without bl@@ emish ; and you shall clean@@ se the sanctuary .
in the first [ month ] , in the four@@ teenth day of the month , you shall have the Pas@@ sover , a feast of seven days ; un@@ leav@@ ened bread shall be eaten .
on that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bull for a sin offering .
he shall prepare a meal offering , an ep@@ ha@@ h for a bull , and an ep@@ ha@@ h for a ram , and a H@@ in of oil to an ep@@ ha@@ h .
in the seventh [ month ] , in the fif@@ teenth day of the month , in the feast , shall he do the like the seven days ; according to the sin offering , according to the burnt offering , and according to the meal offering , and according to the oil .
thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : the gate of the inner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days ; but on the Sabbath day it shall be opened , and on the day of the new moon it shall be opened .
the people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h on the Sab@@ baths and on the new mo@@ ons .
on the day of the new moon it shall be a young bull without bl@@ emish , and six lam@@ bs , and a ram ; they shall be without bl@@ emish :
in the fe@@ asts and in the solem@@ n@@ ities the meal offering shall be an ep@@ ha@@ h for a bull , and an ep@@ ha@@ h for a ram , and for the lam@@ bs as he is able to give , and a H@@ in of oil to an ep@@ ha@@ h .
you shall prepare a meal offering with it morning by morning , the sixth part of an ep@@ ha@@ h , and the third part of a H@@ in of oil , to moist@@ en the fine flour ; a meal offering to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h continually by a perpetual ordin@@ ance .
thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : if the prince give a gift to any of his sons , it is his inheritance , it shall belong to his sons ; it is their possession by inheritance .
then he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the holy rooms for the priests , which looked toward the north : and behold , there was a place on the hinder part w@@ est@@ ward .
he said to me , This is the place where the priests shall boil the t@@ resp@@ ass offering and the sin offering , where they shall b@@ ake the meal offering ; that they not bring them forth into the outer court , to sancti@@ fy the people .
then he brought me forth into the outer court , and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court ; and behold , in every corner of the court there was a court .
in the four corners of the court there were courts enclosed , forty [ cub@@ its ] long and thirty broad : these four in the corners were of one measure .
when the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand , he measured one thousand cub@@ its , and he caused me to pass through the waters , waters that were to the ank@@ les .
it shall happen , that fishermen shall stand by it : from E@@ n G@@ ed@@ i even to E@@ n E@@ gl@@ aim shall be a place for the spreading of nets ; their fish shall be after their kinds , as the fish of the great sea , exceeding many .
but the mir@@ y places of it , and its marsh@@ es , shall not be healed ; they shall be given up to salt .
this shall be the border of the land : on the north side , from the great sea , by the way of H@@ eth@@ lon , to the entrance of Zed@@ ad ;
Ham@@ ath , Ber@@ oth@@ ah , Si@@ bra@@ im , which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Ham@@ ath ; Haz@@ er Hat@@ tic@@ on , which is by the border of H@@ aur@@ an .
the border from the sea , shall be Haz@@ ar En@@ on at the border of Damascus ; and on the north nor@@ th@@ ward is the border of Ham@@ ath . this is the north side .
the east side , between H@@ aur@@ an and Damascus and Gil@@ e@@ ad , and the land of Israel , shall be the Jordan ; from the [ north ] border to the east sea you shall measure . this is the east side .
the south side sou@@ th@@ ward shall be from Tam@@ ar as far as the waters of M@@ eri@@ both Kad@@ esh , to the bro@@ ok [ of Egypt ] , to the great sea . this is the south side sou@@ th@@ ward .
it shall happen , that in what tribe the stranger lives , there you shall give him his inheritance , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
by the border of Dan , from the east side to the west side , Ash@@ er , one [ portion ] .
by the border of N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i , from the east side to the west side , Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , one [ portion ] .
by the border of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , from the east side to the west side , E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , one [ portion ] .
by the border of Re@@ ub@@ en , from the east side to the west side , Jud@@ ah , one [ portion ] .
[ it shall be ] for the priests who are sancti@@ fied of the sons of Z@@ ad@@ ok , who have kept my instruction , who did@@ n '@@ t go astr@@ ay when the children of Israel went astr@@ ay , as the Lev@@ ites went astr@@ ay .
it shall be to them an offering from the offering of the land , a thing most holy , by the border of the Lev@@ ites .
answ@@ er@@ able to the border of the priests , the Lev@@ ites shall have twenty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand in length , and ten thousand in breadth : all the length shall be twenty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand , and the breadth ten thousand .
the five thousand that are left in the breadth , in front of the twenty @@@ -@@ @ five thousand , shall be for common use , for the city , for dwelling and for suburbs ; and the city shall be in its midst .
the city shall have suburbs : toward the north two hundred fifty , and toward the south two hundred fifty , and toward the east two hundred fifty , and toward the west two hundred fifty .
the remainder in the length , answ@@ er@@ able to the holy offering , shall be ten thousand eastward , and ten thousand w@@ est@@ ward ; and it shall be answ@@ er@@ able to the holy offering ; and its increase shall be for food to those who labor in the city .
moreover from the possession of the Lev@@ ites , and from the possession of the city , being in the midst of that which is the prince 's , between the border of Jud@@ ah and the border of Benjamin , it shall be for the prince .
this is the land which you shall divide by lot to the tribes of Israel for inheritance , and these are their several portions , says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
it shall be eighteen thousand [ re@@ eds ] around : and the name of the city from that day shall be , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is there .
the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king 's d@@ ain@@ ties , and of the wine which he drank , and that they should be nourished three years ; that at its end they should stand before the king .
now among these were , of the children of Jud@@ ah , Daniel , Han@@ ani@@ ah , Mis@@ hael , and Az@@ ari@@ ah .
but Daniel pur@@ posed in his heart that he would not def@@ ile himself with the king 's d@@ ain@@ ties , nor with the wine which he drank : therefore he requested of the prince of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s that he might not def@@ ile himself .
then Daniel said to the ste@@ ward whom the prince of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s had appointed over Daniel , Han@@ ani@@ ah , Mis@@ hael , and Az@@ ari@@ ah :
then let our faces be looked on before you , and the face of the youths who eat of the king 's d@@ ain@@ ties ; and as you see , deal with your servants .
at the end of ten days their faces appeared fairer , and they were fat@@ ter in flesh , than all the youths who ate of the king 's d@@ ain@@ ties .
so the ste@@ ward took away their d@@ ain@@ ties , and the wine that they should drink , and gave them pulse .
in the second year of the reign of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar , Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar dreamed dreams ; and his spirit was troubled , and his sleep went from him .
then the king commanded to call the mag@@ icians , and the enchan@@ ters , and the sorcer@@ ers , and the Chal@@ de@@ ans , to tell the king his dreams . so they came in and stood before the king .
then spoke the Chal@@ de@@ ans to the king in the Syrian language , O king , live forever : tell your servants the dream , and we will show the interpretation .
the king answered the Chal@@ de@@ ans , The thing is gone from me : if you don '@@ t make known to me the dream and its interpretation , you shall be cut in pieces , and your houses shall be made a dun@@ gh@@ ill .
it is a rare thing that the king requires , and there is no other who can show it before the king , except the gods , whose dwelling is not with flesh .
for this cause the king was angry and very furious , and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon .
so the decree went forth , and the wise men were to be sl@@ ain ; and they sought Daniel and his companions to be sl@@ ain .
then Daniel returned answer with counsel and prudence to Ari@@ o@@ ch the captain of the king 's guard , who was gone forth to kill the wise men of Babylon ;
Daniel went in , and desired of the king that he would appoint him a time , and he would show the king the interpretation .
that they would desire mer@@ cies of the God of heaven concerning this secret ; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon .
I thank you , and praise you , you God of my fathers , who have given me wisdom and might , and have now made known to me what we desired of you ; for you have made known to us the king 's matter .
the king answered Daniel , whose name was Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen , and its interpretation ?
but there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets , and he has made known to the king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar what shall be in the latter days . your dream , and the visions of your head on your bed , are these :
as for you , O king , your thoughts came [ into your mind ] on your bed , what should happen here@@ after ; and he who reveals secrets has made known to you what shall happen .
and wherever the children of men dwell , the animals of the field and the birds of the sky has he given into your hand , and has made you to rule over them all : you are the head of gold .
then the king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar fell on his face , and worshi@@ ped Daniel , and commanded that they should offer an offering and sweet od@@ ors to him .
then the king made Daniel great , and gave him many great gifts , and made him to rule over the whole province of Babylon , and to be chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon .
Daniel requested of the king , and he appointed Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , M@@ esh@@ ach , and A@@ bed@@ ne@@ go , over the affairs of the province of Babylon : but Daniel was in the gate of the king .
then Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king sent to gather together the sat@@ rap@@ s , the deputies , and the governors , the judges , the treas@@ ur@@ ers , the counsel@@ ors , the sh@@ eri@@ ffs , and all the rulers of the provinces , to come to the dedication of the image which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king had set up .
then the her@@ ald cried aloud , To you it is commanded , peoples , nations , and languages ,
that whenever you hear the sound of the horn , fl@@ ute , zi@@ ther , ly@@ re , har@@ p , pipe , and all kinds of music , you fall down and worship the golden image that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king has set up ;
therefore at that time , when all the peoples heard the sound of the horn , fl@@ ute , zi@@ ther , ly@@ re , har@@ p , pipe , and all kinds of music , all the peoples , the nations , and the languages , fell down and worshi@@ ped the golden image that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king had set up .
you , O king , have made a decree , that every man that shall hear the sound of the horn , fl@@ ute , zi@@ ther , ly@@ re , har@@ p , pipe , and all kinds of music , shall fall down and worship the golden image ;
then Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar in [ his ] rage and fury commanded to bring Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , M@@ esh@@ ach , and A@@ bed@@ ne@@ go . then they brought these men before the king .
if it be [ so ] , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace ; and he will deliver us out of your hand , O king .
then was Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar full of fury , and the form of his appearance was changed against Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , M@@ esh@@ ach , and A@@ bed@@ ne@@ go : [ therefore ] he spoke , and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated .
then these men were bound in their pants , their tun@@ ics , and their M@@ ant@@ les , and their [ other ] garments , and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
then Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king was astonished , and rose up in ha@@ ste : he spoke and said to his counsel@@ ors , did@@ n '@@ t we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire ? they answered the king , True , O king .
he answered , Look , I see four men loose , walking in the midst of the fire , and they are un@@ harmed ; and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of the gods .
then Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace : he spoke and said , Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , M@@ esh@@ ach , and A@@ bed@@ ne@@ go , you servants of the Most High God , come forth , and come here . then Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , M@@ esh@@ ach , and A@@ bed@@ ne@@ go came forth out of the midst of the fire .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me , that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream .
then came in the mag@@ icians , the enchan@@ ters , the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and the soo@@ th@@ say@@ ers ; and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known to me its interpretation .
but at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , according to the name of my god , and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods : and I told the dream before him , [ saying ] ,
thus were the visions of my head on my bed : I saw , and behold , a tree in the midst of the earth ; and its height was great .
whose leaves were beautiful , and its fruit much , and in it was food for all ; under which the animals of the field lived , and on whose branches the birds of the sky had their hab@@ itation :
it is you , O king , that are grown and become strong ; for your greatness is grown , and reaches to the sky , and your dom@@ inion to the end of the earth .
therefore , O king , let my counsel be acceptable to you , and break off your sins by righteousness , and your ini@@ qu@@ ities by showing mercy to the poor ; if there may be a leng@@ th@@ ening of your tranquility .
the king spoke and said , Is not this great Babylon , which I have built for the royal dwelling place , by the might of my power and for the glory of my maj@@ esty ?
while the word was in the king 's mouth , there fell a voice from the sky , [ saying ] , O king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar , to you it is spoken : the kingdom has departed from you :
now I , Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar , praise and ex@@ to@@ l and honor the King of heaven ; for all his works are truth , and his ways justice ; and those who walk in pride he is able to ab@@ ase .
Bel@@ sha@@ zz@@ ar , while he t@@ asted the wine , commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar his father had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem ; that the king and his lords , his wives and his conc@@ ub@@ ines , might drink from them .
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of God 's house which was at Jerusalem ; and the king and his lords , his wives and his conc@@ ub@@ ines , drank from them .
then the king 's face was changed in him , and his thoughts troubled him ; and the joints of his thi@@ gh@@ s were loos@@ ened , and his knees struck one against another .
then was Daniel brought in before the king . the king spoke and said to Daniel , Are you that Daniel , who are of the children of the cap@@ tivity of Jud@@ ah , whom the king my father brought out of Jud@@ ah ?
I have heard of you , that the spirit of the gods is in you , and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you .
now the wise men , the enchan@@ ters , have been brought in before me , that they should read this writing , and make known to me its interpretation ; but they could not show the interpretation of the thing .
then Daniel answered before the king , Let your gifts be to yourself , and give your rewards to another ; nevertheless I will read the writing to the king , and make known to him the interpretation .
you , king , the Most High God gave Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar your father the kingdom , and greatness , and glory , and maj@@ esty :
and because of the greatness that he gave him , all the peoples , nations , and languages trem@@ bled and feared before him : whom he would he killed , and whom he would he kept alive ; and whom he would he raised up , and whom he would he put down .
but when his heart was lifted up , and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly , he was de@@ posed from his kingly throne , and they took his glory from him :
this is the interpretation of the thing : Men@@ e ; God has numbered your kingdom , and brought it to an end ;
then this Daniel was distinguished above the presidents and the sat@@ rap@@ s , because an excellent spirit was in him ; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm .
now , O king , establish the decree , and sign the writing , that it not be changed , according to the law of the Med@@ es and Per@@ sians , which do@@ es@@ n '@@ t alter .
then answered they and said before the king , That Daniel , who is of the children of the cap@@ tivity of Jud@@ ah , do@@ es@@ n '@@ t respect you , O king , nor the decree that you have signed , but makes his petition three times a day .
then these men assembled together to the king , and said to the king , Know , O king , that it is a law of the Med@@ es and Per@@ sians , that no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed .
then the king commanded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the den of lions . [ now ] the king spoke and said to Daniel , Your God whom you serve continually , he will deliver you .
a stone was brought , and laid on the mouth of the den ; and the king sealed it with his own sig@@ net , and with the sig@@ net of his lords ; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel .
when he came near to the den to Daniel , he cried with a lam@@ ent@@ able voice ; the king spoke and said to Daniel , Daniel , servant of the living God , is your God , whom you serve continually , able to deliver you from the lions ?
my God has sent his angel , and has shut the lions ' mouths , and they have not hurt me ; because as before him innocence was found in me ; and also before you , O king , have I done no hurt .
then was the king exceeding glad , and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . so Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no kind of harm was found on him , because he had trusted in his God .
Daniel spoke and said , I saw in my vision by night , and , behold , the four winds of the sky broke forth on the great sea .
after this I saw , and behold , another , like a le@@ op@@ ard , which had on its back four wings of a bird ; the animal had also four heads ; and dom@@ inion was given to it .
a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him : thousands of thousands minist@@ ered to him , and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him : the judgment was set , and the books were opened .
I saw at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke ; I saw even until the animal was sl@@ ain , and its body destroyed , and it was given to be burned with fire .
as for the rest of the animals , their dom@@ inion was taken away : yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time .
there was given him dom@@ inion , and glory , and a kingdom , that all the peoples , nations , and languages should serve him : his dom@@ inion is an everlasting dom@@ inion , which shall not pass away , and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed .
as for me , Daniel , my spirit was griev@@ ed in the midst of my body , and the visions of my head troubled me .
I came near to one of those who stood by , and asked him the truth concerning all this . so he told me , and made me know the interpretation of the things .
then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth animal , which was diverse from all of them , exceedingly terrible , whose teeth were of iron , and its nails of brass ; which dev@@ oured , broke in pieces , and stamped the resi@@ due with its feet ;
until the ancient of days came , and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High , and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom .
thus he said , The fourth animal shall be a fourth kingdom on earth , which shall be diverse from all the king@@ doms , and shall dev@@ our the whole earth , and shall t@@ read it down , and break it in pieces .
as for the ten horns , out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise : and another shall arise after them ; and he shall be diverse from the former , and he shall put down three kings .
he shall speak words against the Most High , and shall wear out the saints of the Most High ; and he shall think to change the times and the law ; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time .
here is the end of the matter . as for me , Daniel , my thoughts much troubled me , and my face was changed in me : but I kept the matter in my heart .
I saw in the vision ; now it was so , that when I saw , I was in the cit@@ ad@@ el of Sus@@ a , which is in the province of EL@@ AM ; and I saw in the vision , and I was by the river U@@ la@@ i .
then I lifted up my eyes , and saw , and behold , there stood before the river a ram which had two horns : and the two horns were high ; but one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last .
the male goat magni@@ fied himself exceedingly : and when he was strong , the great horn was broken ; and instead of it there came up four notable [ horns ] toward the four winds of the sky .
it happened , when I , even I Daniel , had seen the vision , that I sought to understand it ; and behold , there stood before me as the appearance of a man .
I heard a man 's voice between [ the banks of ] the U@@ la@@ i , which called , and said , Gabriel , make this man to understand the vision .
he said , Be@@ hold , I will make you know what shall be in the latter time of the indignation ; for it belongs to the appointed time of the end .
the ram which you saw , that had the two horns , they are the kings of Media and Persia .
his power shall be mighty , but not by his own power ; and he shall destroy wonder@@ fully , and shall prosper and do [ his pleasure ] ; and he shall destroy the mighty ones and the holy people .
I , Daniel , fain@@ ted , and was sick certain days ; then I rose up , and did the king 's business : and I wondered at the vision , but none understood it .
in the first year of D@@ arius the son of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , of the seed of the Med@@ es , who was made king over the realm of the Chal@@ de@@ ans ,
in the first year of his reign I , Daniel , understood by the books the number of the years about which the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came to Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet , for the accompl@@ ishing of the des@@ ol@@ ations of Jerusalem , even seventy years .
I prayed to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h my God , and made confession , and said , Oh , Lord , the great and dreadful God , who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments ,
neither have we listened to your servants the prophets , who spoke in your name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
he has confirmed his words , which he spoke against us , and against our judges who judged us , by bringing on us a great evil ; for under the whole sky , such has not been done as has been done to Jerusalem .
as it is written in the law of Moses , all this evil has come on us : yet have we not entre@@ ated the favor of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God , that we should turn from our ini@@ qu@@ ities , and have discer@@ n@@ ment in your truth .
therefore has Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h watched over the evil , and brought it on us ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h our God is righteous in all his works which he does , and we have not obeyed his voice .
now , Lord our God , who has brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and have gotten yourself renow@@ n , as at this day ; we have sin@@ ned , we have done w@@ ick@@ edly .
now therefore , our God , listen to the prayer of your servant , and to his peti@@ tions , and cause your face to shine on your sanctuary that is des@@ ol@@ ate , for the Lord 's sake .
at the beginning of your peti@@ tions the commandment went forth , and I have come to tell you ; for you are greatly beloved : therefore consider the matter , and understand the vision .
in the third year of Cy@@ rus king of Persia a thing was revealed to Daniel , whose name was called Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar ; and the thing was true , even a great warfare : and he understood the thing , and had understanding of the vision .
yet heard I the voice of his words ; and when I heard the voice of his words , then was I fallen into a deep sleep on my face , with my face toward the ground .
but the prince of the kingdom of Persia with@@ stood me twenty @@@ -@@ @ one days ; but , behold , Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me : and I remained there with the kings of Persia .
and when he had spoken to me according to these words , I set my face toward the ground , and was mute .
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for as for me , immediately there remained no strength in me , neither was there breath left in me .
also their gods , with their mol@@ ten images , with their goo@@ dly vessels of silver and of gold , shall he carry captive into Egypt ; and he shall refrain some years from the king of the north .
he shall come into the realm of the king of the south , but he shall return into his own land .
his sons shall war , and shall assemble a multitude of great forces , which shall come on , and over@@ flow , and pass through ; and they shall return and war , even to his fortress .
the multitude shall be lifted up , and his heart shall be exalted ; and he shall cast down tens of thousands , but he shall not prevail .
then shall stand up in his place one who shall cause a tax collector to pass through the kingdom to maintain its glory ; but within few days he shall be destroyed , neither in anger , nor in battle .
as for both these kings , their hearts shall be to do mis@@ chief , and they shall speak lies at one table : but it shall not prosper ; for yet the end shall be at the time appointed .
then shall he return into his land with great substance ; and his heart [ shall be ] against the holy covenant ; and he shall do [ his pleasure ] , and return to his own land .
such as do w@@ ick@@ edly against the covenant shall he perver@@ t by fl@@ atter@@ ies ; but the people who know their God shall be strong , and do [ exploits ] .
now when they shall fall , they shall be helped with a little help ; but many shall join themselves to them with fl@@ atter@@ ies .
he shall stretch forth his hand also on the countries ; and the land of Egypt shall not escape .
but news out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him ; and he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to sweep away many .
he shall plant the tents of his palace between the sea and the glorious holy mountain ; yet he shall come to his end , and none shall help him .
many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake , some to everlasting life , and some to shame and everlasting contempt .
but you , Daniel , shut up the words , and seal the book , even to the time of the end : many shall run back and forth , and knowledge shall be increased . "
then I , Daniel , looked , and behold , two others stood , one on the river bank on this side , and the other on the river bank on that side .
one said to the man clo@@ thed in linen , who was above the waters of the river , How long shall it be to the end of these wonders ?
many shall puri@@ fy themselves , and make themselves white , and be refined ; but the wicked shall do w@@ ick@@ edly ; and none of the wicked shall understand ; but those who are wise shall understand .
but go you your way until the end ; for you shall rest , and shall stand in your lot , at the end of the days .
the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h that came to Hos@@ ea the son of Be@@ eri , in the days of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , Jo@@ th@@ am , A@@ haz , and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , kings of Jud@@ ah , and in the days of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Jo@@ ash , king of Israel .
when Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke at first by Hos@@ ea , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Hos@@ ea , " Go , take for yourself a wife of prostitution and children of un@@ faith@@ fulness ; for the land commits great adul@@ tery , for@@ s@@ aking Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to him , " Call his name J@@ ez@@ re@@ el ; for yet a little while , and I will av@@ enge the blood of J@@ ez@@ re@@ el on the house of Je@@ hu , and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel to cease .
it will happen in that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of J@@ ez@@ re@@ el . "
but I will have mercy on the house of Jud@@ ah , and will save them by Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God , and will not save them by bow , sword , battle , horses , or hor@@ sem@@ en . "
the children of Jud@@ ah and the children of Israel will be gathered together , and they will appoint themselves one head , and will go up from the land ; for great will be the day of J@@ ez@@ re@@ el .
contend with your mother ! contend , for she is not my wife , neither am I her husband ; and let her put away her prostitution from her face , and her adul@@ ter@@ ies from between her breasts ;
lest I strip her naked , and make her bare as in the day that she was born , and make her like a wilderness , and set her like a dry land , and kill her with thirst .
indeed , on her children I will have no mercy ; for they are children of un@@ faith@@ fulness ;
for their mother has played the pro@@ stitute . she who conceived them has done sham@@ efully ; for she said , ' I will go after my lovers , who give me my bread and my water , my wool and my fla@@ x , my oil and my drink . '
therefore behold , I will hedge up your way with thor@@ ns , and I will build a wall against her , that she can '@@ t find her way .
she will follow after her lovers , but she won '@@ t over@@ take them ; and she will seek them , but won '@@ t find them . then she will say , ' I will go and return to my first husband ; for then was it better with me than now . '
therefore I will take back my grain in its time , and my new wine in its season , and will pl@@ uck away my wool and my fla@@ x which should have covered her n@@ ak@@ edness .
I will visit on her the days of the Ba@@ als , to which she burned inc@@ ense , when she dec@@ ked herself with her ear@@ rings and her jew@@ els , and went after her lovers , and forgot me , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
I will give her vineyards from there , and the valley of Ach@@ or for a door of hope ; and she will respond there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
I will bet@@ ro@@ th you to me forever . yes , I will bet@@ ro@@ th you to me in righteousness , in justice , in loving kindness , and in compassion .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to me , " Go again , love a woman loved by another , and an adul@@ ter@@ ess , even as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h loves the children of Israel , though they turn to other gods , and love cakes of ra@@ is@@ ins . "
I said to her , " You shall stay with me many days . you shall not play the pro@@ stitute , and you shall not be with any other man . I will also be so toward you . "
for the children of Israel shall live many days without king , and without prince , and without sacrifice , and without sacred stone , and without ep@@ ho@@ d or idols .
afterward the children of Israel shall return , and seek Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h their God , and David their king , and shall come with trembling to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h and to his blessings in the last days .
hear the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , you children of Israel ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has a charge against the inhabitants of the land : " indeed there is no truth , nor goodness , nor knowledge of God in the land .
" yet let no man bring a charge , neither let any man accuse ; For your people are like those who bring charges against a priest .
my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge . because you have rejected knowledge , I will also reject you , that you may be no priest to me . because you have forgotten your God 's law , I will also forget your children .
they sacrifice on the tops of the mountains , and burn inc@@ ense on the hills , under o@@ aks and po@@ pl@@ ars and ter@@ e@@ bin@@ ths , because its shade is good . therefore your daughters play the pro@@ stitute , and your bri@@ des commit adul@@ tery .
" listen to this , you priests ! listen , house of Israel , and give ear , house of the king ! for the judgment is against you ; for you have been a sn@@ are at M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h , and a net spread on Tab@@ or .
I know E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and Israel is not hidden from me ; for now , E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , you have played the pro@@ stitute . Israel is de@@ filed .
their deeds won '@@ t allow them to turn to their God ; for the spirit of prostitution is within them , and they don '@@ t know Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
they will go with their f@@ locks and with their herds to seek Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; but they won '@@ t find him . he has withdrawn himself from them .
the princes of Jud@@ ah are like those who remove a landmark . I will pour out my wrath on them like water .
let us acknowledge Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . let us press on to know Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . as surely as the sun rises , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will appear . he will come to us like the rain , like the spring rain that waters the earth . "
" E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , what shall I do to you ? Jud@@ ah , what shall I do to you ? for your love is like a morning cloud , and like the de@@ w that disappears early .
in the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing . there is prostitution in E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im . Israel is de@@ filed .
when I would heal Israel , then the ini@@ qu@@ ity of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is uncovered , also the w@@ ick@@ edness of Sam@@ aria ; for they commit false@@ hood , and the thief enters in , and the gang of rob@@ bers rav@@ ages outside .
they are all adul@@ ter@@ ers . they are burning like an oven that the b@@ aker stops stirring , from the kne@@ ading of the d@@ ough , until it is leav@@ ened .
for they have prepared their heart like an oven , while they lie in wait . their b@@ aker sle@@ eps all the night . in the morning it burns as a fl@@ aming fire .
when they go , I will spread my net on them . I will bring them down like the birds of the sky . I will ch@@ as@@ tise them , as their congregation has heard .
w@@ oe to them ! for they have wan@@ dered from me . destruction to them ! for they have t@@ resp@@ assed against me . though I would re@@ deem them , yet they have spoken lies against me .
they return , but not to the Most High . they are like a faulty bow . their princes will fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue . this will be their deri@@ sion in the land of Egypt .
" put the trum@@ pet to your lips ! something like an eagle is over Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's house , because they have broken my covenant , and reb@@ elled against my law .
they have set up kings , but not by me . they have made princes , and I did@@ n '@@ t approve . of their silver and their gold they have made themselves idols , that they may be cut off .
let Sam@@ aria throw out his cal@@ f idol ! my anger burns against them ! how long will it be until they are capable of purity ?
for this is even from Israel ! the work@@ man made it , and it is no God ; indeed , the cal@@ f of Sam@@ aria shall be broken in pieces .
but although they sold themselves among the nations , I will now gather them ; and they begin to waste away because of the oppression of the king of mighty ones .
as for the sacrifices of my offerings , they sacrifice flesh and eat it ; But Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h do@@ es@@ n '@@ t accept them . now he will remember their ini@@ qu@@ ity , and punish their sins . they will return to Egypt .
for Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces ; and Jud@@ ah has multiplied fortified cities ; but I will send a fire on his cities , and it will dev@@ our its fort@@ resses . "
they won '@@ t dwell in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's land ; but E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im will return to Egypt , and they will eat un@@ clean food in As@@ sy@@ ria .
for , behold , they have gone away from destruction . Egypt will gather them up . M@@ emp@@ his will bury them . net@@ tles will possess their pleasant things of silver . thor@@ ns will be in their tents .
a prophet watches over E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im with my God . a F@@ ow@@ ler 's sn@@ are is on all of his paths , and hostility in the house of his God .
" all their w@@ ick@@ edness is in Gil@@ gal ; for there I hated them . because of the w@@ ick@@ edness of their deeds I will drive them out of my house ! I will love them no more . all their princes are rebels .
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is struck . their root has dried up . they will bear no fruit . even though they bring forth , yet I will kill the beloved ones of their womb . "
my God will cast them away , because they did not listen to him ; and they will be wan@@ der@@ ers among the nations .
surely now they will say , " We have no king ; for we don '@@ t fear Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and the king , what can he do for us ? "
it also will be carried to As@@ sy@@ ria for a present to a great king . E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im will receive shame , and Israel will be ashamed of his own counsel .
the high places also of A@@ ven , the sin of Israel , will be destroyed . the thor@@ n and the th@@ ist@@ le will come up on their al@@ t@@ ars . they will tell the mountains , " C@@ over us ! " and the hills , " Fall on us ! "
when it is my desire , I will ch@@ as@@ tise them ; and the nations will be gathered against them , when they are bound to their two trans@@ gres@@ sions .
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is a trained hei@@ fer that loves to th@@ resh ; so I will put a y@@ oke on her beautiful neck . I will set a ri@@ der on E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im . Jud@@ ah will plo@@ w . Jacob will break his clo@@ ds .
you have pl@@ owed w@@ ick@@ edness . you have re@@ aped ini@@ qu@@ ity . you have eaten the fruit of lies , for you trusted in your way , in the multitude of your mighty men .
therefore a battle ro@@ ar will arise among your people , and all your fort@@ resses will be destroyed , as Shal@@ man destroyed B@@ eth Ar@@ bel in the day of battle . the mother was d@@ ashed in pieces with her children .
they called to them , so they went from them . they sacrificed to the Ba@@ als , and burned inc@@ ense to engra@@ ved images .
the sword will fall on their cities , and will destroy the bars of their gates , and will put an end to their plans .
they will come trembling like a bird out of Egypt , and like a do@@ ve out of the land of As@@ sy@@ ria ; and I will settle them in their houses , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im surrounds me with false@@ hood , and the house of Israel with dece@@ it . Jud@@ ah still str@@ ays from God , and is un@@ faithful to the Holy One .
indeed , he struggled with the angel , and prevailed ; he we@@ pt , and made suppl@@ ication to him . he found him at Be@@ the@@ l , and there he spoke with us ,
" but I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God from the land of Egypt . I will yet again make you dwell in tents , as in the days of the solemn feast .
Jacob fled into the country of A@@ ram , and Israel served to get a wife , and for a wife he tended f@@ locks and herds .
I will meet them like a bear that is ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed of her c@@ ubs , and will tear the covering of their heart . there I will dev@@ our them like a lion@@ ess . the wild animal will tear them .
I will ran@@ som them from the power of She@@ ol . I will re@@ deem them from death ! death , where are your pl@@ agues ? She@@ ol , where is your destruction ? " compassion will be hidden from my eyes .
Sam@@ aria will bear her guilt ; for she has reb@@ elled against her God . they will fall by the sword . their infants will be d@@ ashed in pieces , and their pregnant women will be ri@@ pped open . "
who is wise , that he may understand these things ? who is prudent , that he may know them ? for the ways of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h are right , and the righteous walk in them ; But the rebelli@@ ous stum@@ ble in them .
hear this , you elders , And listen , all you inhabitants of the land . has this ever happened in your days , or in the days of your fathers ?
wake up , you drun@@ k@@ ards , and we@@ ep ! w@@ ail , all you drin@@ kers of wine , because of the sweet wine ; for it is cut off from your mouth .
for a nation has come up on my land , strong , and without number . his teeth are the teeth of a lion , and he has the f@@ ang@@ s of a lion@@ ess .
he has laid my vine waste , and stripped my fi@@ g tree . he has stripped its bark , and thrown it away . its branches are made white .
be conf@@ ounded , you farmers ! w@@ ail , you viney@@ ard keepers ; for the wheat and for the barley ; for the harvest of the field has perished .
sancti@@ fy a fast . call a solemn assembly . gather the elders , and all the inhabitants of the land , to the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , your God , and cry to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
the seeds rot under their clo@@ ds . the gran@@ aries are laid des@@ ol@@ ate . the bar@@ ns are broken down , for the grain has with@@ ered .
how the animals gro@@ an ! the herds of livestock are perpl@@ exed , because they have no past@@ ure . yes , the f@@ locks of sheep are made des@@ ol@@ ate .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , I cry to you , For the fire has dev@@ oured the past@@ ures of the wilderness , and the flame has burned all the trees of the field .
yes , the animals of the field pant to you , for the water bro@@ o@@ ks have dried up , And the fire has dev@@ oured the past@@ ures of the wilderness .
blow the trum@@ pet in Z@@ ion , and sound an alarm in my holy mountain ! let all the inhabitants of the land trem@@ ble , for the day of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h comes , for it is close at hand :
a fire dev@@ ours before them , and behind them , a flame burns . the land is as the garden of Eden before them , and behind them , a des@@ ol@@ ate wilderness . yes , and no one has escaped them .
their appearance is as the appearance of horses , and as hor@@ sem@@ en , so do they run .
like the noise of ch@@ ari@@ ots on the tops of the mountains do they leap , like the noise of a flame of fire that dev@@ ours the stub@@ ble , as a strong people set in battle array .
neither does one jo@@ st@@ le another ; they march everyone in his path , and they burst through the defenses , and don '@@ t break ranks .
they rush on the city . they run on the wall . they climb up into the houses . they enter in at the windows like thieves .
the earth qu@@ akes before them . the heavens trem@@ ble . the sun and the moon are dark@@ ened , and the stars withdraw their shining .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h th@@ un@@ ders his voice before his army ; for his forces are very great ; for he is strong who obe@@ ys his command ; for the day of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is great and very awesome , and who can endure it ?
tear your heart , and not your garments , and turn to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , your God ; for he is gr@@ acious and mer@@ ciful , slow to anger , and abundant in loving kindness , and rel@@ ents from sending calamity .
who knows ? he may turn and Rel@@ ent , and leave a blessing behind him , even a meal offering and a drink offering to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , your God .
gather the people . sancti@@ fy the assembly . assemble the elders . gather the children , and those who nurse from breasts . let the bri@@ deg@@ room go forth from his room , and the bride out of her room .
" be glad then , you children of Z@@ ion , and rejoice in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , your God ; for he gives you the former rain in just measure , and he causes the rain to come down for you , the former rain and the latter rain , as before .
I will restore to you the years that the s@@ warming loc@@ ust has eaten , the great loc@@ ust , the gras@@ shop@@ per , and the cat@@ er@@ pillar , my great army , which I sent among you .
you will have plenty to eat , and be satisfied , and will praise the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , your God , who has dealt won@@ dr@@ ously with you ; and my people will never again be disappointed .
you will know that I am in the midst of Israel , and that I am Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , your God , and there is no one else ; and my people will never again be disappointed .
" it will happen afterward , that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh ; and your sons and your daughters will proph@@ esy . your old men will dream dreams . your young men will see visions .
it will happen that whoever will call on the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h shall be saved ; for in Mount Z@@ ion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape , as Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has said , and among the remn@@ ant , those whom Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h calls .
I will gather all nations , and will bring them down into the valley of Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at ; and I will execute judgment on them there for my people , and for my heritage , Israel , whom they have scattered among the nations . they have divided my land ,
" yes , and what are you to me , Ty@@ re , and Sid@@ on , and all the regions of Phil@@ is@@ tia ? will you repay me ? and if you repay me , I will swiftly and spe@@ ed@@ ily return your repayment on your own head .
proclaim this among the nations : " prepare for war ! stir up the mighty men . let all the warriors draw near . let them come up .
hurry and come , all you surrounding nations , and gather yourselves together . " cause your mighty ones to come down there , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
" let the nations ar@@ ouse themselves , and come up to the valley of Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at ; for there will I sit to judge all the surrounding nations .
put in the sick@@ le ; for the harvest is ripe . come , t@@ read , for the win@@ ep@@ ress is full , the v@@ ats over@@ flow , for their w@@ ick@@ edness is great . "
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will ro@@ ar from Z@@ ion , and thunder from Jerusalem ; and the heavens and the earth will shake ; but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will be a refuge to his people , and a strongh@@ old to the children of Israel .
Egypt will be a des@@ ol@@ ation , and E@@ dom will be a des@@ ol@@ ate wilderness , for the violence done to the children of Jud@@ ah , because they have shed innocent blood in their land .
the words of A@@ mos , who was among the her@@ d@@ smen of Te@@ ko@@ a , which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uz@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , and in the days of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Jo@@ ash king of Israel , two years before the earthquake .
he said : " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will ro@@ ar from Z@@ ion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem ; and the past@@ ures of the shep@@ herds will mour@@ n , and the top of Car@@ me@@ l will wi@@ ther . "
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : " for three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Gaza , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they carried away captive the whole community , to deliver them up to E@@ dom ;
but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza , and it will dev@@ our its palaces .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : " for three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Ty@@ re , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they delivered up the whole community to E@@ dom , and did@@ n '@@ t remember the bro@@ ther@@ ly covenant ;
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : " for three trans@@ gres@@ sions of E@@ dom , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because he pursued his brother with the sword , and cast off all pity , and his anger raged continually , and he kept his wrath forever ;
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : " for three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Mo@@ ab , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because he burned the bones of the king of E@@ dom into lime ;
and I will cut off the judge from their midst , and will kill all its princes with him , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : " for three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Israel , yes , for four , I will not turn away its punishment ; because they have sold the righteous for silver , and the ne@@ edy for a pair of shoes ;
they tr@@ ample on the dust of the earth on the head of the poor , and deny justice to the oppressed ; and a man and his father use the same mai@@ den , to prof@@ ane my holy name ;
and they lay themselves down beside every altar on clothes taken in pledge ; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined .
yet I destroyed the A@@ mor@@ ite before them , whose height was like the height of the c@@ ed@@ ars , and he was strong as the o@@ aks ; yet I destroyed his fruit from above , and his roots from beneath .
also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt , and led you forty years in the wilderness , to possess the land of the A@@ mor@@ ite .
I raised up some of your sons for prophets , and some of your young men for Naz@@ ir@@ ites . is@@ n '@@ t this true , you children of Israel ? " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
" but you gave the Naz@@ ir@@ ites wine to drink , and commanded the prophets , saying , ' Don '@@ t proph@@ esy ! '
behold , I will crush you in your place , as a cart cr@@ ushes that is full of grain .
neither shall he stand who handles the bow ; and he who is swift of foot won '@@ t escape ; neither shall he who rides the horse deliver himself ;
and he who is courageous among the mighty will flee away naked on that day , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
" you only have I chosen of all the families of the earth . therefore I will punish you for all of your sins . "
proclaim in the palaces at Ash@@ do@@ d , and in the palaces in the land of Egypt , and say , " assemble yourselves on the mountains of Sam@@ aria , and see what unrest is in her , and what oppression is among them . "
" indeed they don '@@ t know to do right , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " Who ho@@ ard pl@@ under and loo@@ t in their palaces . "
" for in the day that I visit the trans@@ gres@@ sions of Israel on him , I will also visit the al@@ t@@ ars of Be@@ the@@ l ; and the horns of the altar will be cut off , and fall to the ground .
listen to this word , you cows of Bash@@ an , who are on the mountain of Sam@@ aria , who op@@ press the poor , who crush the ne@@ edy , who tell their husbands , " B@@ ring us drinks ! "
you will go out at the breaks in the wall , everyone straight before her ; and you will cast yourselves into H@@ arm@@ on , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
offer a sacrifice of thank@@ s@@ giving of that which is leav@@ ened , and proclaim free will offerings and bra@@ g about them : for this pleas@@ es you , you children of Israel , " says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
for , behold , he who forms the mountains , and creates the wind , and declares to man what is his thought ; who makes the morning darkness , and t@@ reads on the high places of the earth : Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Arm@@ ies , is his name . "
for thus says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : " the city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left , and that which went forth one hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel . "
but don '@@ t seek Be@@ the@@ l , nor enter into Gil@@ gal , and don '@@ t pass to Be@@ er@@ she@@ ba : for Gil@@ gal shall surely go into cap@@ tivity , and Be@@ the@@ l shall come to nothing .
for I know how many your offenses , and how great are your sin@@ s@@ -- you who aff@@ l@@ ict the just , who take a bribe , and who turn aside the ne@@ edy in the courts .
therefore a prudent person keeps silent in such a time , for it is an evil time .
in all vineyards there will be w@@ ailing ; for I will pass through the midst of you , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
yes , though you offer me your burnt offerings and meal offerings , I will not accept them ; neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat animals .
you also carried the tent of your king and the shr@@ ine of your images , the star of your god , which you made for yourselves .
therefore will I cause you to go into cap@@ tivity beyond Damascus , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , whose name is the God of Arm@@ ies .
go to Cal@@ ne@@ h , and see ; and from there go to Ham@@ ath the great ; then go down to G@@ ath of the Phil@@ ist@@ in@@ es@@ . are they better than these king@@ doms ? or is their border greater than your border ?
those who put far away the evil day , and cause the seat of violence to come near ;
who lie on beds of iv@@ ory , and stretch themselves on their cou@@ ches , and eat the lam@@ bs out of the flock , and the cal@@ ves out of the midst of the stall ;
therefore they will now go captive with the first who go captive ; and the fe@@ asting and loun@@ ging will end .
" the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has sworn by himself , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Arm@@ ies : " I abh@@ or the pride of Jacob , and det@@ est his fort@@ resses . therefore I will deliver up the city with all that is in it .
" for , behold , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h commands , and the great house will be sm@@ ashed to pieces , and the little house into bits .
do horses run on the rocky cr@@ ags ? does one plo@@ w there with ox@@ en ? but you have turned justice into poison , and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness ;
you who rejoice in a thing of nothing , who say , ' Hav@@ en '@@ t we taken for ourselves horns by our own strength ? '
thus the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h showed me : and behold , he formed lo@@ cu@@ sts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth ; and behold , it was the latter growth after the king 's harvest .
then I said , " Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , stop , I beg you ! how could Jacob stand ? for he is small . "
thus he showed me and behold , the Lord stood beside a wall made by a plum@@ b line , with a plum@@ b line in his hand .
then Ama@@ zi@@ ah the priest of Be@@ the@@ l sent to J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am king of Israel , saying , " A@@ mos has con@@ spi@@ red against you in the midst of the house of Israel . the land is not able to bear all his words .
Ama@@ zi@@ ah also said to A@@ mos , " You se@@ er , go , flee away into the land of Jud@@ ah , and there eat bread , and proph@@ esy there :
then A@@ mos answered Ama@@ zi@@ ah , " I was no prophet , neither was I a prophet 's son ; but I was a her@@ d@@ sman , and a farmer of sy@@ cam@@ ore fi@@ gs ;
now therefore listen to the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : ' you say , Don '@@ t proph@@ esy against Israel , and don '@@ t preach against the house of Isaac . '
he said , " A@@ mos , what do you see ? " I said , " A basket of summer fruit . " then Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to me , " The end has come on my people Israel . I will not again pass by them any more .
won '@@ t the land trem@@ ble for this , and everyone mour@@ n who d@@ wells in it ? yes , it will rise up wholly like the River ; and it will be stirred up and sink again , like the River of Egypt .
behold , the days come , " says the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " that I will send a famine in the land , not a famine of bread , nor a thirst for water , but of hearing the words of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
though they hide themselves in the top of Car@@ me@@ l , I will search and take them out there ; and though they be hidden from my sight in the bottom of the sea , there I will command the ser@@ pent , and it will bite them .
though they go into cap@@ tivity before their enemies , there I will command the sword , and it will kill them . I will set my eyes on them for evil , and not for good .
for the Lord , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , is he who touches the land and it mel@@ ts , and all who dwell in it will mour@@ n ; and it will rise up wholly like the River , and will sink again , like the River of Egypt .
are you not like the children of the Ethiop@@ ians to me , children of Israel ? " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . " haven '@@ t I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt , and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines from Cap@@ h@@ tor , and the Syrians from K@@ ir ?
I will bring my people Israel back from cap@@ tivity , and they will rebuild the ruined cities , and inhabit them ; and they will plant vineyards , and drink wine from them . they shall also make gardens , and eat their fruit .
the vision of Ob@@ adi@@ ah . this is what the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h says about E@@ dom . we have heard news from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and an ambassador is sent among the nations , saying , " A@@ rise , and let 's rise up against her in battle .
the pride of your heart has deceived you , you who dwell in the cle@@ fts of the rock , whose hab@@ itation is high , who says in his heart , ' Who will bring me down to the ground ? '
" won '@@ t I in that day , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " destroy the wise men out of E@@ dom , and understanding out of the mountain of Es@@ au ?
for the violence done to your brother Jacob , shame will cover you , and you will be cut off forever .
Don '@@ t enter into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity . Don '@@ t look down on their afflic@@ tion in the day of their calamity , neither seize their wealth on the day of their calamity .
for the day of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is near all the nations ! as you have done , it will be done to you . your deeds will return upon your own head .
for as you have drunk on my holy mountain , so will all the nations drink continually . yes , they will drink , swallow down , and will be as though they had not been .
but in Mount Z@@ ion , there will be those who escape , and it will be holy . the house of Jacob will possess their possessions .
the house of Jacob will be a fire , the house of Joseph a flame , and the house of Es@@ au for stub@@ ble . they will burn among them , and dev@@ our them . there will not be any remaining to the house of Es@@ au . " indeed , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has spoken .
those of the South will possess the mountain of Es@@ au , and those of the low@@ land , the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . they will possess the field of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and the field of Sam@@ aria . Benjamin will possess Gil@@ e@@ ad .
but Jon@@ ah rose up to flee to Tar@@ sh@@ ish from the presence of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . he went down to J@@ op@@ pa , and found a ship going to Tar@@ sh@@ ish ; so he paid its fare , and went down into it , to go with them to Tar@@ sh@@ ish from the presence of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
but Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h sent out a great wind on the sea , and there was a mighty storm on the sea , so that the ship was likely to break up .
then the mar@@ in@@ ers were afraid , and every man cried to his god . they threw the cargo that was in the ship into the sea to ligh@@ ten the ship . but Jon@@ ah had gone down into the in@@ ner@@ most parts of the ship , and he was laying down , and was fast asleep .
so the ship@@ master came to him , and said to him , " What do you mean , sle@@ eper ? arise , call on your God ! maybe your God will notice us , so that we won '@@ t perish . "
they all said to each other , " Come , let us cast lots , that we may know who is responsible for this evil that is on us . " so they cast lots , and the lot fell on Jon@@ ah .
then were the men exceedingly afraid , and said to him , " What is this that you have done ? " for the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , because he had told them .
then they said to him , " What shall we do to you , that the sea may be calm to us ? " for the sea grew more and more stor@@ my .
he said to them , " Take me up , and throw me into the sea . then the sea will be calm for you ; for I know that because of me this great storm is on you . "
but let them be covered with s@@ ack@@ cloth , both man and animal , and let them cry mi@@ gh@@ tily to God . yes , let them turn everyone from his evil way , and from the violence that is in his hands .
then Jon@@ ah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made himself a booth , and sat under it in the shade , until he might see what would become of the city .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h God prepared a vine , and made it to come up over Jon@@ ah , that it might be a shade over his head , to deliver him from his discomfort . so Jon@@ ah was exceedingly glad because of the vine .
it happened , when the sun arose , that God prepared a sul@@ try east wind ; and the sun beat on Jon@@ ah 's head , so that he fain@@ ted , and requested for himself that he might die , and said , " It is better for me to die than to live . "
Sh@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t I be concerned for N@@ inev@@ eh , that great city , in which are more than one hundred twenty thousand persons who can '@@ t discern between their right hand and their left hand ; and also much livestock ? "
hear , you peoples , all of you . listen , O earth , and all that is therein : and let the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h be witness against you , the Lord from his holy temple .
the mountains melt under him , and the valleys split apart , like wax before the fire , like waters that are poured down a steep place .
" all this is for the disobedience of Jacob , and for the sins of the house of Israel . what is the disobedience of Jacob ? is@@ n '@@ t it Sam@@ aria ? and what are the high places of Jud@@ ah ? are@@ n '@@ t they Jerusalem ?
all her idols will be beaten to pieces , and all her temple gifts will be burned with fire , and all her images I will destroy ; for of the hire of a pro@@ stitute has she gathered them , and to the hire of a pro@@ stitute shall they return . "
pass on , inhabit@@ ant of Sha@@ ph@@ ir , in n@@ ak@@ edness and shame . the inhabit@@ ant of Za@@ an@@ an won '@@ t come out . the w@@ ailing of B@@ eth E@@ z@@ el will take from you his protection .
for the inhabit@@ ant of Mar@@ o@@ th waits anxi@@ ously for good , because evil has come down from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to the gate of Jerusalem .
therefore you will give a par@@ ting gift to More@@ sh@@ eth G@@ ath . the houses of Ach@@ zi@@ b will be a dece@@ it@@ ful thing to the kings of Israel .
I will yet bring to you , inhabit@@ ant of Ma@@ resha@@ h . he who is the glory of Israel will come to Ad@@ ul@@ lam .
w@@ oe to those who devise ini@@ qu@@ ity and work evil on their beds ! when the morning is light , they practice it , because it is in the power of their hand .
they co@@ vet fields , and seize them ; and houses , and take them away : and they op@@ press a man and his house , even a man and his heritage .
shall it be said , O house of Jacob : " is the Spirit of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h angry ? are these his do@@ ings ? Don '@@ t my words do good to him who walks bl@@ am@@ el@@ essly ? "
he who breaks open the way goes up before them . they break through the gate , and go out . and their king passes on before them , with Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h at their head .
I said , " Please listen , you heads of Jacob , and rulers of the house of Israel : is@@ n '@@ t it for you to know justice ?
who also eat the flesh of my people , and fl@@ ay their skin from off them , and break their bones , and cho@@ p them in pieces , as for the pot , and as flesh within the cal@@ dr@@ on .
then they will cry to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , but he will not answer them . yes , he will hide his face from them at that time , because they made their deeds evil . "
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h concerning the prophets who lead my people astr@@ ay ; for those who feed their teeth , they proclaim , " Peace ! " and whoever do@@ es@@ n '@@ t provide for their mouths , they prepare war against him :
and he will judge between many peoples , and will decide concerning strong nations af@@ ar off . they will beat their s@@ words into pl@@ ow@@ shares , and their spe@@ ars into pr@@ un@@ ing hoo@@ ks . nation will not lift up sword against nation , neither will they learn war any more .
but they will sit every man under his vine and under his fi@@ g tree ; and no one will make them afraid : for the mouth of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies has spoken .
but they don '@@ t know the thoughts of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , neither do they understand his counsel ; for he has gathered them like the she@@ aves to the thresh@@ ing floor .
arise and th@@ resh , daughter of Z@@ ion ; for I will make your horn iron , and I will make your hoo@@ fs brass ; and you will beat in pieces many peoples : and I will devote their gain to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth .
therefore he will abandon them until the time that she who is in labor gives birth . then the rest of his brothers will return to the children of Israel .
he shall stand , and shall shepherd in the strength of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , in the maj@@ esty of the name of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h his God : and they will live , for then he will be great to the ends of the earth .
he will be our peace when As@@ sy@@ ria inv@@ ades our land , and when he mar@@ ches through our fort@@ resses , then we will raise against him seven shep@@ herds , and eight leaders of men .
they will rule the land of As@@ sy@@ ria with the sword , and the land of N@@ im@@ rod in its gates . he will deliver us from the As@@ sy@@ rian , when he inv@@ ades our land , and when he mar@@ ches within our border .
the remn@@ ant of Jacob will be in the midst of many peoples , like de@@ w from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , like showers on the grass , that don '@@ t wait for man , nor wait for the sons of men .
let your hand be lifted up above your adversaries , and let all of your enemies be cut off .
hear , you mountains , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's controversy , and you enduring foundations of the earth ; for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has a controversy with his people , and he will contend with Israel .
for I brought you up out of the land of Egypt , and re@@ deemed you out of the house of bond@@ age . I sent before you Moses , Aaron , and Mi@@ ri@@ am .
how shall I come before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and bow myself before the exalted God ? shall I come before him with burnt offerings , with cal@@ ves a year old ?
will Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h be pleased with thousands of r@@ ams ? with tens of thousands of rivers of oil ? shall I give my fir@@ st@@ born for my disobedience ? the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul ?
you shall eat , but not be satisfied . your humiliation will be in your midst . you will store up , but not save ; and that which you save I will give up to the sword .
for the statutes of Om@@ ri are kept , and all the works of the house of A@@ hab . you walk in their coun@@ sels , that I may make you a ruin , and her inhabitants a his@@ sing ; And you will bear the repro@@ ach of my people . "
the go@@ dly man has perished out of the earth , and there is no one upright among men . they all lie in wait for blood ; every man hun@@ ts his brother with a net .
the best of them is like a bri@@ er . the most upright is worse than a thor@@ n hedge . the day of your watch@@ men , even your vis@@ itation , has come ; now is the time of their confusion .
but as for me , I will look to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . I will wait for the God of my salvation . my God will hear me .
Don '@@ t rejoice against me , my enemy . when I fall , I will arise . when I sit in darkness , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will be a light to me .
then my enemy will see it , and shame will cover her who said to me , where is Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h your God ? then my enemy will see me and will cover her shame . now she will be tro@@ dden down like the mire of the streets .
the nations will see and be ashamed of all their might . they will lay their hand on their mouth . their ears will be deaf .
who is a God like you , who par@@ d@@ ons ini@@ qu@@ ity , and passes over the disobedience of the remn@@ ant of his heritage ? he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t retain his anger forever , because he deli@@ ghts in loving kindness .
you will give truth to Jacob , and mercy to Abraham , as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is a jeal@@ ous God and av@@ eng@@ es . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h av@@ eng@@ es and is full of wrath . Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h takes vengeance on his adversaries , and he maintains wrath against his enemies .
he rebu@@ kes the sea , and makes it dry , and dri@@ es up all the rivers . Bash@@ an langu@@ ishes , and Car@@ me@@ l ; and the flower of Lebanon langu@@ ishes .
the mountains quake before him , and the hills melt away . the earth trem@@ bles at his presence , yes , the world , and all who dwell in it .
who can stand before his indignation ? who can endure the fierc@@ eness of his anger ? his wrath is poured out like fire , and the rocks are broken apart by him .
what do you plot against Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ? he will make a full end . afflic@@ tion won '@@ t rise up the second time .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : " though they be in full strength , and likewise many , even so they will be cut down , and he shall pass away . though I have afflicted you , I will aff@@ l@@ ict you no more .
behold , on the mountains the feet of him who brings good news , who publishes peace ! keep your fe@@ asts , Jud@@ ah ! perform your v@@ ows , for the wicked one will no more pass through you . he is utterly cut off .
for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h rest@@ ores the excell@@ ency of Jacob , as the excell@@ ency of Israel ; for the destroyers have destroyed them , and ruined their vine branches .
the shield of his mighty men is made red . the val@@ i@@ ant men are in scar@@ let . the ch@@ ari@@ ots flash with steel in the day of his preparation , and the pine spe@@ ars are bran@@ dis@@ hed .
the ch@@ ari@@ ots rage in the streets . they rush back and forth in the broad ways . their appearance is like tor@@ ches . they run like the light@@ nings .
it is decre@@ ed : she is uncovered , she is carried away ; and her hand@@ m@@ aids mo@@ an as with the voice of d@@ oves , beating on their breasts .
but N@@ inev@@ eh has been from of old like a pool of water , yet they flee away . " stop ! stop ! " they cry , but no one looks back .
where is the den of the lions , and the feeding place of the young lions , where the lion and the lion@@ ess walked , the lion 's c@@ ubs , and no one made them afraid ?
the lion t@@ ore in pieces enough for his c@@ ubs , and strang@@ led for his lion@@ esses , and filled his caves with the kill , and his dens with prey .
the noise of the whi@@ p , the noise of the ratt@@ ling of wheels , pr@@ ancing horses , and b@@ ounding ch@@ ari@@ ots ,
because of the multitude of the prostitution of the all@@ uring pro@@ stitute , the mistress of wit@@ ch@@ craft , who sells nations through her prostitution , and families through her wit@@ ch@@ craft .
" behold , I am against you , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , " and I will lift your skirts over your face . I will show the nations your n@@ ak@@ edness , and the king@@ doms your shame .
it will happen that all those who look at you will flee from you , and say , ' N@@ inev@@ eh is laid waste ! who will mour@@ n for her ? ' where will I seek comfor@@ ters for you ? "
are you better than No @@@ -@@ @ Am@@ on , who was situated among the rivers , who had the waters around her ; whose ram@@ part was the sea , and her wall was of the sea ?
yet was she carried away . she went into cap@@ tivity . her young children also were d@@ ashed in pieces at the head of all the streets , and they cast lots for her honorable men , and all her great men were bound in chains .
all your fort@@ resses will be like fi@@ g trees with the first @@@ -@@ @ ripe fi@@ gs : if they are shaken , they fall into the mouth of the e@@ ater .
behold , your troops in your midst are women . the gates of your land are set wide open to your enemies . the fire has dev@@ oured your bars .
there the fire will dev@@ our you . the sword will cut you off . it will dev@@ our you like the gras@@ shop@@ per . multiply like gras@@ shop@@ pers . multiply like the loc@@ ust .
your shep@@ herds sl@@ umber , king of As@@ sy@@ ria . your no@@ bles lie down . your people are scattered on the mountains , and there is no one to gather them .
why do you show me ini@@ qu@@ ity , and look at per@@ versity ? for destruction and violence are before me . there is strife , and contention rises up .
for , behold , I raise up the Chal@@ de@@ ans , that bitter and ha@@ sty nation , that march through the breadth of the earth , to possess dwelling places that are not theirs .
their horses also are swif@@ ter than le@@ op@@ ards , and are more fierce than the evening wolves . their hor@@ sem@@ en press proudly on . yes , their hor@@ sem@@ en come from af@@ ar . they fly as an eagle that hur@@ ries to dev@@ our .
yes , he s@@ coff@@ s at kings , and princes are a deri@@ sion to him . he laughs at every strongh@@ old , for he builds up an ear@@ then ramp , and takes it .
then he swe@@ eps by like the wind , and goes on . he is indeed guilty , whose strength is his god . "
and make men like the fish of the sea , like the cre@@ eping things , that have no ruler over them ?
he takes up all of them with the hook . he catches them in his net , and g@@ athers them in his dr@@ ag@@ net . therefore he rejo@@ ices and is glad .
I will stand at my watch , and set myself on the ram@@ parts , and will look out to see what he will say to me , and what I will answer concerning my complaint .
for the vision is yet for the appointed time , and it hur@@ ries toward the end , and won '@@ t prove false . though it takes time , wait for it ; because it will surely come . it won '@@ t delay .
yes , moreover , wine is treach@@ erous . a ha@@ u@@ ghty man who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t stay at home , who enlarg@@ es his desire as She@@ ol , and he is like death , and can '@@ t be satisfied , but g@@ athers to himself all nations , and he@@ aps to himself all peoples .
because you have pl@@ under@@ ed many nations , all the remn@@ ant of the peoples will pl@@ under you , because of men 's blood , and for the violence done to the land , to the city and to all who dwell in it .
w@@ oe to him who gets an evil gain for his house , that he may set his nest on high , that he may be delivered from the hand of evil !
" w@@ oe to him who gives his neighbor drink , pouring your infl@@ aming wine until they are drunk , so that you may gaze at their naked bodies !
you are filled with shame , and not glory . you will also drink , and be exposed ! the cup of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's right hand will come around to you , and dis@@ grace will cover your glory .
he stood , and shook the earth . he looked , and made the nations trem@@ ble . the ancient mountains were crum@@ bled . the age @@@ -@@ @ old hills collapsed . his ways are eternal .
the mountains saw you , and were afraid . the storm of waters passed by . the deep ro@@ ared and lifted up its hands on high .
you went forth for the salvation of your people , for the salvation of your ano@@ inted . you crushed the head of the land of w@@ ick@@ edness . you stripped them head to foot . Sel@@ ah .
for though the fi@@ g tree do@@ es@@ n '@@ t flourish , nor fruit be in the v@@ ines ; the labor of the olive fails , the fields yield no food ; the f@@ locks are cut off from the fold , and there is no herd in the st@@ alls :
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the Lord , is my strength . he makes my feet like deer 's feet , and enables me to go in high places . for the music director , on my str@@ ing@@ ed instruments .
the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h which came to Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah , the son of C@@ ush@@ i , the son of G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , the son of A@@ mari@@ ah , the son of He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , in the days of Jo@@ si@@ ah , the son of Am@@ on , king of Jud@@ ah .
be silent at the presence of the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , for the day of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is at hand . for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has prepared a sacrifice . he has consec@@ rated his guests .
in that day , I will punish all those who leap over the threshold , who fill their master 's house with violence and dece@@ it .
it will happen at that time , that I will search Jerusalem with lamps , and I will punish the men who are settled on their d@@ reg@@ s , who say in their heart , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will not do good , neither will he do evil . "
the great day of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is near . it is near , and hur@@ ries greatly , the voice of the day of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . the mighty man cries there bit@@ terly .
that day is a day of wrath , a day of distress and angu@@ ish , a day of trouble and ruin , a day of darkness and glo@@ om , a day of clouds and black@@ ness ,
before the appointed time when the day passes as the cha@@ ff , before the fierce anger of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h comes on you , before the day of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's anger comes on you .
seek Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , all you humble of the land , who have kept his ordin@@ ances . seek righteousness . seek humility . it may be that you will be hidden in the day of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's anger .
w@@ oe to the inhabitants of the sea coast , the nation of the Cher@@ eth@@ ites ! the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is against you , Can@@ a@@ an , the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . I will destroy you , that there will be no inhabit@@ ant .
the coast will be for the remn@@ ant of the house of Jud@@ ah . they will find past@@ ure . in the houses of Ash@@ kel@@ on , they will lie down in the evening , for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , their God , will visit them , and restore them .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will be awesome to them , for he will fam@@ ish all the gods of the land . men will worship him , everyone from his place , even all the shores of the nations .
her prophets are arrogant and treach@@ erous people . her priests have prof@@ an@@ ed the sanctuary . they have done violence to the law .
I have cut off nations . their batt@@ l@@ ements are des@@ ol@@ ate . I have made their streets waste , so that no one passes by . their cities are destroyed , so that there is no man , so that there is no inhabit@@ ant .
the remn@@ ant of Israel will not do ini@@ qu@@ ity , nor speak lies , neither will a dece@@ it@@ ful tongue be found in their mouth , for they will feed and lie down , and no one will make them afraid . "
in that day , it will be said to Jerusalem , " Don '@@ t be afraid , Z@@ ion . Don '@@ t let your hands be weak . "
at that time will I bring you in , and at that time will I gather you ; for I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth , when I restore your fortunes before your eyes , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
in the second year of D@@ arius the king , in the sixth month , in the first day of the month , the Word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came by H@@ agg@@ ai , the prophet , to Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el , the son of S@@ heal@@ ti@@ el , governor of Jud@@ ah , and to Joshua , the son of Je@@ ho@@ z@@ ad@@ ak , the high priest , saying ,
" this is what Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies says : these people say , ' The time h@@ as@@ n '@@ t yet come , the time for Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's house to be built . ' "
go up to the mountain , bring wood , and build the house . I will take pleasure in it , and I will be glori@@ fied , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
I called for a drought on the land , on the mountains , on the grain , on the new wine , on the oil , on that which the ground brings forth , on men , on livestock , and on all the labor of the hands . "
then H@@ agg@@ ai , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's messenger , spoke Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's message to the people , saying , " I am with you , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
this is the word that I coven@@ anted with you when you came out of Egypt , and my Spirit lived among you . ' Don '@@ t be afraid . '
and I will shake all nations . the precious things of all nations will come , and I will fill this house with glory , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies .
'@@ the latter glory of this house will be greater than the former , ' says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies ; ' and in this place will I give peace , ' says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies . "
then H@@ agg@@ ai answered , " ' So is this people , and so is this nation before me , ' says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; ' and so is every work of their hands . that which they offer there is un@@ clean .
through all that time , when one came to a heap of twenty measures , there were only ten . when one came to the wine v@@ at to draw out fifty , there were only twenty .
I struck you with b@@ light , mil@@ de@@ w , and hail in all the work of your hands ; yet you did@@ n '@@ t turn to me , ' says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
is the seed yet in the bar@@ n ? yes , the vine , the fi@@ g tree , the p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate , and the olive tree haven '@@ t brought forth . from this day will I bless you . ' "
the Word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came the second time to H@@ agg@@ ai in the twenty @@@ -@@ @ fourth day of the month , saying ,
in that day , says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , will I take you , Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el , my servant , the son of S@@ heal@@ ti@@ el , ' says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , ' and will make you as a sig@@ net , for I have chosen you , ' says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies . "
in the eighth month , in the second year of D@@ arius , the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came to Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of Id@@ do , the prophet , saying ,
therefore tell them : thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies : ' return to me , ' says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , ' and I will return to you , ' says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies .
on the twenty @@@ -@@ @ fourth day of the eleventh month , which is the month She@@ bat , in the second year of D@@ arius , the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h came to Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of Id@@ do , the prophet , saying ,
then I asked , ' My lord , what are these ? ' " the angel who talked with me said to me , " I will show you what these are . "
the man who stood among the my@@ r@@ tle trees answered , " They are the ones Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h has sent to go back and forth through the earth . "
then the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h replied , " O Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Jud@@ ah , against which you have had indignation these seventy years ? "
so the angel who talked with me said to me , " proclaim , saying , ' Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies : " I am jeal@@ ous for Jerusalem and for Z@@ ion with a great jealousy .
I am very angry with the nations that are at ease ; for I was but a little dis@@ pleased , but they added to the calamity . "
therefore thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h : " I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy . my house shall be built in it , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , " and a line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem . " '
" proclaim further , saying , ' Th@@ us says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies : " my cities will again over@@ flow with prosperity , and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will again comfort Z@@ ion , and will again choose Jerusalem . " ' "
I asked the angel who talked with me , " What are these ? " he answered me , " These are the horns which have scattered Jud@@ ah , Israel , and Jerusalem . "
then I asked , " Where are you going ? " he said to me , " To measure Jerusalem , to see what is its breadth and what is its length . "
come ! come ! flee from the land of the north , ' says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; ' for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the sky , ' says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
for thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies : ' for honor he has sent me to the nations which pl@@ under@@ ed you ; for he who touches you touches the apple of his eye .
for , behold , I will shake my hand over them , and they will be a spoil to those who served them ; and you will know that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies has sent me .
sing and rejoice , daughter of Z@@ ion ; for , behold , I come , and I will dwell in the midst of you , ' says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
many nations shall join themselves to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h in that day , and shall be my people ; and I will dwell in the midst of you , and you shall know that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies has sent me to you .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to Satan , " Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h rebu@@ ke you , Satan ! yes , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h who has chosen Jerusalem rebu@@ ke you ! is@@ n '@@ t this a burning stick pl@@ ucked out of the fire ? "
he answered and spoke to those who stood before him , saying , " Take the fil@@ thy garments off of him . " to him he said , " Be@@ hold , I have caused your ini@@ qu@@ ity to pass from you , and I will clo@@ the you with rich clothing . "
I said , " Let them set a clean Tur@@ ban on his head . " so they set a clean Tur@@ ban on his head , and clo@@ thed him ; and the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h was standing by .
hear now , Joshua the high priest , you and your fellows who sit before you ; for they are men who are a sign : for , behold , I will bring forth my servant , the Branch .
for , behold , the stone that I have set before Joshua ; on one stone are seven eyes : behold , I will engra@@ ve its engra@@ ving , ' says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , ' and I will remove the ini@@ qu@@ ity of that land in one day .
and two olive trees by it , one on the right side of the bowl , and the other on the left side of it . "
I answered and spoke to the angel who talked with me , saying , " What are these , my lord ? "
then he answered and spoke to me , saying , " This is the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h to Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el , saying , ' Not by might , nor by power , but by my Spirit , ' says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies .
" the hands of Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el have laid the foundation of this house . his hands shall also finish it ; and you will know that Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies has sent me to you .
then I asked him , " What are these two olive trees on the right side of the lam@@ p@@ stand and on the left side of it ? "
I asked him the second time , " What are these two olive branches , which are beside the two golden sp@@ outs , that pour the golden oil out of themselves ? "
then again I lifted up my eyes , and saw , and behold , a flying scroll .
he said to me , " What do you see ? " I answered , " I see a flying scroll ; its length is twenty cub@@ its , and its breadth ten cub@@ its . "
then he said to me , " This is the curse that goes out over the surface of the whole land ; for everyone who ste@@ als shall be cut off according to it on the one side ; and everyone who sw@@ ears fal@@ sely shall be cut off according to it on the other side .
then the angel who talked with me came forward , and said to me , " Lift up now your eyes , and see what is this that is appearing . "
I said , " What is it ? " he said , " This is the ep@@ ha@@ h basket that is appearing . " he said moreover , " This is their appearance in all the land
he said , " This is W@@ ick@@ edness " ; and he threw her down into the midst of the ep@@ ha@@ h basket ; and he threw the weight of lead on its mouth .
then I said to the angel who talked with me , " Where are these carrying the ep@@ ha@@ h basket ? "
the angel answered me , " These are the four winds of the sky , which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth .
then he called to me , and spoke to me , saying , " Be@@ hold , those who go toward the north country have qui@@ eted my spirit in the north country . "
" take of them of the cap@@ tivity , even of Hel@@ d@@ ai , of Tob@@ i@@ jah , and of J@@ ed@@ aiah ; and come the same day , and go into the house of Jo@@ si@@ ah the son of Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah , where they have come from Babylon .
yes , take silver and gold , and make crow@@ ns , and set them on the head of Joshua the son of Je@@ ho@@ z@@ ad@@ ak , the high priest ;
even he shall build Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's temple ; and he shall bear the glory , and shall sit and rule on his throne ; and he shall be a priest on his throne ; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both .
the crow@@ ns shall be to Hel@@ em , and to Tob@@ i@@ jah , and to J@@ ed@@ aiah , and to H@@ en the son of Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah , for a memorial in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's temple .
and to speak to the priests of the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , and to the prophets , saying , " Should I we@@ ep in the fifth month , separating myself , as I have done these so many years ? "
" speak to all the people of the land , and to the priests , saying , ' When you fast@@ ed and mour@@ ned in the fifth and in the seventh month for these seventy years , did you at all fast to me , really to me ?
are@@ n '@@ t these the words which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h proclaimed by the former prophets , when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity , and its cities around her , and the South and the low@@ land were inhabited ? ' "
yes , they made their hearts as hard as fl@@ int , lest they might hear the law , and the words which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies had sent by his Spirit by the former prophets . therefore great wrath came from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies .
it has come to pass that , as he called , and they refused to listen , so they will call , and I will not listen , " said Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies ;
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies : " I am jeal@@ ous for Z@@ ion with great jealousy , and I am jeal@@ ous for her with great wrath . "
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies : " old men and old women will again dwell in the streets of Jerusalem , every man with his staff in his hand for very age .
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies : " if it is marvelous in the eyes of the remn@@ ant of this people in those days , should it also be marvelous in my eyes ? " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies .
and I will bring them , and they will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem ; and they will be my people , and I will be their God , in truth and in righteousness . "
" for the seed of peace and the vine will yield its fruit , and the ground will give its increase , and the heavens will give their de@@ w ; and I will cause the remn@@ ant of this people to inherit all these things .
it shall come to pass that , as you were a curse among the nations , house of Jud@@ ah and house of Israel , so will I save you , and you shall be a blessing . Don '@@ t be afraid . let your hands be strong . "
so again have I thought in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Jud@@ ah . Don '@@ t be afraid .
these are the things that you shall do : speak every man the truth with his neighbor . execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates ,
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies : " the fasts of the fourth fifth , seventh , and tenth months shall be for the house of Jud@@ ah joy and gl@@ ad@@ ness , and cheerful fe@@ asts . therefore love truth and peace . "
thus says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies : " many peoples , and the inhabitants of many cities will yet come ;
and the inhabitants of one shall go to another , saying , ' Let us go spe@@ ed@@ ily to entre@@ at the favor of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and to seek Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies . I will go also . '
yes , many peoples and strong nations will come to seek Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies in Jerusalem , and to entre@@ at the favor of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . "
an or@@ acle . the word of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h is against the land of Had@@ r@@ ach , and will rest upon Damascus ; for the eye of man and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ;
behold , the Lord will dis@@ possess her , and he will strike her power in the sea ; and she will be dev@@ oured with fire .
Ash@@ kel@@ on will see it , and fear ; Gaza also , and will w@@ ri@@ the in agony ; as will Ek@@ ron , for her expectation will be disappointed ; and the king will perish from Gaza , and Ash@@ kel@@ on will not be inhabited .
I will take away his blood out of his mouth , and his ab@@ om@@ inations from between his teeth ; and he also will be a remn@@ ant for our God ; and he will be as a chief@@ tain in Jud@@ ah , and Ek@@ ron as a Je@@ bus@@ ite .
rejoice greatly , daughter of Z@@ ion ! shout , daughter of Jerusalem ! behold , your King comes to you ! he is righteous , and having salvation ; low@@ ly , and riding on a don@@ key , even on a col@@ t , the fo@@ al of a don@@ key .
I will cut off the ch@@ ari@@ ot from E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and the horse from Jerusalem ; and the battle bow will be cut off ; and he will speak peace to the nations : and his dom@@ inion will be from sea to sea , and from the River to the ends of the earth .
as for you also , because of the blood of your covenant , I have set free your prisoners from the pit in which is no water .
turn to the strongh@@ old , you prisoners of hope ! even today I declare that I will restore double to you .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will be seen over them ; and his arrow will go flash like lightning ; and the Lord Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will blow the trum@@ pet , and will go with whir@@ l@@ winds of the south .
for how great is his goodness , and how great is his beauty ! grain will make the young men flourish , and new wine the vir@@ gins .
ask of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h rain in the spring time , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h who makes storm clouds , and he gives rain showers to everyone for the plants in the field .
for the ter@@ ap@@ him have spoken van@@ ity , and the div@@ in@@ ers have seen a lie ; and they have told false dreams . they comfort in vain . therefore they go their way like sheep . they are oppressed , because there is no shepherd .
my anger is kind@@ led against the shep@@ herds , and I will punish the male goats ; For Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies has visited his flock , the house of Jud@@ ah , and will make them as his majestic horse in the battle .
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im will be like a mighty man , and their heart will rejoice as through wine ; yes , their children will see it , and rejoice . their heart will be glad in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of As@@ sy@@ ria ; and I will bring them into the land of Gil@@ e@@ ad and Lebanon ; and there won '@@ t be room enough for them .
I will strengthen them in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ; and they will walk up and down in his name , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
w@@ ail , f@@ ir tree , for the c@@ edar has fallen , because the st@@ ately ones are destroyed . w@@ ail , you o@@ aks of Bash@@ an , for the strong forest has come down .
a voice of the w@@ ailing of the shep@@ herds ! for their glory is destroyed : a voice of the ro@@ aring of young lions ! for the pride of the Jordan is ruined .
their buyers slaughter them , and go un@@ punished . those who sell them say , ' Bless@@ ed be Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , for I am rich ; ' and their own shep@@ herds don '@@ t pity them .
so I fed the flock of slaughter , especially the oppressed of the flock . I took for myself two staff@@ s . the one I called " Fav@@ or , " and the other I called " Union , " and I fed the flock .
Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h said to me , " Th@@ row it to the pot@@ ter , the handsome price that I was valued at by them ! " I took the thirty pieces of silver , and threw them to the pot@@ ter , in the house of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h .
" behold , I will make Jerusalem a cup of re@@ eling to all the surrounding peoples , and on Jud@@ ah also will it be in the siege against Jerusalem .
it will happen in that day , that I will make Jerusalem a bur@@ den@@ some stone for all the peoples . all who burden themselves with it will be severely wounded , and all the nations of the earth will be gathered together against it .
in that day , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " I will strike every horse with terror , and his ri@@ der with madness ; and I will open my eyes on the house of Jud@@ ah , and will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness .
the chief@@ tains of Jud@@ ah will say in their heart , ' The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies their God . '
in that day Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem . he who is fee@@ ble among them at that day will be like David , and the house of David will be like God , like the angel of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h before them .
it will happen in that day , that I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem .
in that day there will be a great mourning in Jerusalem , like the mourning of Had@@ ad@@ ri@@ m@@ mon in the valley of Me@@ gi@@ d@@ don .
the land will mour@@ n , every family apart ; the family of the house of David apart , and their wives apart ; the family of the house of Na@@ than apart , and their wives apart ;
the family of the house of Lev@@ i apart , and their wives apart ; the family of the Shim@@ e@@ ites apart , and their wives apart ;
one will say to him , ' What are these wounds between your arms ? ' then he will answer , ' Th@@ ose with which I was wounded in the house of my friends . '
it shall happen that in all the land , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , " two parts in it will be cut off and die ; but the third will be left in it .
for I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle ; and the city will be taken , the houses ri@@ fled , and the women ra@@ vis@@ hed . half of the city will go out into cap@@ tivity , and the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city .
then Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will go out and fight against those nations , as when he fought in the day of battle .
it will happen in that day , that there will not be light , cold , or frost .
it will happen in that day , that living waters will go out from Jerusalem ; half of them toward the eastern sea , and half of them toward the western sea ; in summer and in winter will it be .
it will happen in that day , that a great panic from Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will be among them ; and they will lay hold everyone on the hand of his neighbor , and his hand will rise up against the hand of his neighbor .
Jud@@ ah also will fight at Jerusalem ; and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered together : gold , and silver , and clothing , in great abundance .
so will be the plague of the horse , of the mu@@ le , of the cam@@ el , and of the don@@ key , and of all the animals that will be in those camps , as that plague .
it will happen that everyone who is left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up from year to year to worship the King , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , and to keep the feast of tents .
it will be , that whoever of all the families of the earth do@@ es@@ n '@@ t go up to Jerusalem to worship the King , Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , on them there will be no rain .
if the family of Egypt do@@ es@@ n '@@ t go up , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t come , neither will it rain on them . this will be the plague with which Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h will strike the nations that don '@@ t go up to keep the feast of tents .
this will be the punishment of Egypt , and the punishment of all the nations that don '@@ t go up to keep the feast of tents .
in that day there will be on the bells of the horses , " HO@@ LY TO Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h " ; and the pots in Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h 's house will be like the bow@@ ls before the altar .
" now , please entre@@ at the favor of God , that he may be gr@@ acious to us . with this , will he accept any of you ? " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies .
" Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors , that you might not kind@@ le fire on my altar in vain ! I have no pleasure in you , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , " neither will I accept an offering at your hand .
you will know that I have sent this commandment to you , that my covenant may be with Lev@@ i , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies .
" my covenant was with him of life and peace ; and I gave them to him that he might be rever@@ ent toward me ; and he was rever@@ ent toward me , and stood in awe of my name .
for the priest 's lips should keep knowledge , and they should seek the law at his mouth ; for he is the messenger of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies .
" therefore I have also made you cont@@ emp@@ tible and base before all the people , according to the way you have not kept my ways , but have had respect for persons in the law .
Jud@@ ah has dealt treach@@ er@@ ously , and an ab@@ om@@ ination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem ; for Jud@@ ah has prof@@ an@@ ed the hol@@ iness of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h which he loves , and has married the daughter of a foreign god .
this again you do : you cover the altar of Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h with tears , with we@@ eping , and with sigh@@ ing , because he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t regard the offering any more , neither receives it with good will at your hand .
for I hate divorce , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , the God of Israel , " and him who covers his garment with violence ! " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies . " therefore take heed to your spirit , that you don '@@ t deal treach@@ er@@ ously .
" but who can endure the day of his coming ? and who will stand when he appears ? for he is like a refin@@ er 's fire , and like la@@ under@@ er 's soap ;
and he will sit as a refin@@ er and puri@@ fier of silver , and he will puri@@ fy the sons of Lev@@ i , and refine them as gold and silver ; and they shall offer to Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h offerings in righteousness .
from the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my ordin@@ ances , and have not kept them . return to me , and I will return to you , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies . " but you say , ' How shall we return ? '
" your words have been st@@ out against me , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h . " yet you say , ' What have we spoken against you ? '
you have said , ' It is vain to serve God ; ' and ' What profit is it that we have followed his instructions , and that we have walked mour@@ n@@ fully before Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies ?
then those who feared Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h spoke one with another ; and Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h listened , and heard , and a book of memory was written before him , for those who feared Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , and who honored his name .
they shall be mine , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies , " my own possession in the day that I make , and I will spare them , as a man sp@@ ares his own son who serves him .
then you shall return and discern between the righteous and the wicked , between him who serves God and him who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t serve him .
you shall t@@ read down the wicked ; for they will be ashes under the sol@@ es of your feet in the day that I make , " says Y@@ ah@@ we@@ h of Arm@@ ies .
he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , and the hearts of the children to their fathers , lest I come and strike the earth with a curse . "
after the exile to Babylon , J@@ ec@@ hon@@ i@@ ah became the father of S@@ heal@@ ti@@ el . S@@ heal@@ ti@@ el became the father of Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el .
so all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations ; from David to the exile to Babylon fourteen generations ; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the Christ , fourteen generations .
now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this ; for after his mother , Mary , was engaged to Joseph , before they came together , she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit .
Joseph , her husband , being a righteous man , and not willing to make her a public example , intended to put her away secretly .
but when he thought about these things , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream , saying , " Joseph , son of David , don '@@ t be afraid to take to yourself Mary , your wife , for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit .
she shall bring forth a son . you shall call his name Jesus , for it is he who shall save his people from their sins . "
Joseph arose from his sleep , and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him , and took his wife to himself ;
now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Ju@@ dea in the days of King Her@@ od , behold , wise men from the east came to Jerusalem , saying ,
'@@ You Bethlehem , land of Jud@@ ah , are in no way least among the princes of Jud@@ ah : for out of you shall come forth a governor , who shall shepherd my people , Israel . ' "
he sent them to Bethlehem , and said , " Go and search dilig@@ ently for the young child . when you have found him , bring me word , so that I also may come and worship him . "
they , having heard the king , went their way ; and behold , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , until it came and stood over where the young child was .
and was there until the death of Her@@ od ; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet , saying , " Out of Egypt I called my son . "
" a voice was heard in Ram@@ ah , lam@@ entation , we@@ eping and great mourning , Rach@@ el we@@ eping for her children ; she w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t be comfor@@ ted , because they are no more . "
but when Her@@ od was dead , behold , an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt , saying ,
" arise and take the young child and his mother , and go into the land of Israel , for those who sought the young child 's life are dead . "
but when he heard that Arch@@ el@@ aus was re@@ igning over Ju@@ dea in the place of his father , Her@@ od , he was afraid to go there . being warned in a dream , he withdrew into the region of Gal@@ ilee ,
and came and lived in a city called Naz@@ areth ; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets : " he will be called a Naz@@ aren@@ e . "
but when he saw many of the Pharis@@ ees and Sad@@ duc@@ ees coming for his baptism , he said to them , " You offspring of vi@@ pers , who warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
" even now the ax@@ e lies at the root of the trees . therefore every tree that do@@ es@@ n '@@ t bring forth good fruit is cut down , and cast into the fire .
I indeed bap@@ ti@@ ze you in water for repentance , but he who comes after me is mi@@ gh@@ tier than I , whose shoes I am not worthy to carry . he will bap@@ ti@@ ze you in the Holy Spirit .
but Jesus , answering , said to him , " Allow it now , for this is the fitting way for us to fulfill all righteousness . " then he allowed him .
behold , a voice out of the heavens said , " This is my beloved Son , with whom I am well pleased . "
but he answered , " It is written , ' Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God . ' "
then the devil took him into the holy city . he set him on the pin@@ n@@ acle of the temple ,
again , the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain , and showed him all the king@@ doms of the world , and their glory .
leaving Naz@@ areth , he came and lived in Cap@@ ern@@ au@@ m , which is by the sea , in the region of Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n and N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i ,
" the land of Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n and the land of N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i , toward the sea , beyond the Jordan , Gal@@ ilee of the Genti@@ les ,
the people who sat in darkness saw a great light , to those who sat in the region and shadow of death , to them light has d@@ aw@@ ned . "
rejoice , and be exceedingly glad , for great is your reward in heaven . for that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you .
" you are the salt of the earth , but if the salt has lost its flavor , with what will it be sal@@ ted ? it is then good for nothing , but to be cast out and tro@@ dden under the feet of men .
even so , let your light shine before men ; that they may see your good works , and glori@@ fy your Father who is in heaven .
" Don '@@ t think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets . I did@@ n '@@ t come to destroy , but to fulfill .
whoever , therefore , shall break one of these least commandments , and teach others to do so , shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven ; but whoever shall do and teach them shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven .
for I tell you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scri@@ bes and Pharis@@ ees , there is no way you will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven .
most certainly I tell you , you shall by no means get out of there , until you have paid the last penny .
if your right eye causes you to stum@@ ble , pl@@ uck it out and throw it away from you . for it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish , than for your whole body to be cast into Ge@@ hen@@ na .
if your right hand causes you to stum@@ ble , cut it off , and throw it away from you . for it is more profitable for you that one of your members should perish , than for your whole body to be cast into Ge@@ hen@@ na .
" it was also said , ' Who@@ ever shall put away his wife , let him give her a writing of divorce , '
but I tell you that whoever puts away his wife , except for the cause of sexual im@@ morality , makes her an adul@@ ter@@ ess ; and whoever mar@@ ries her when she is put away commits adul@@ tery .
nor by the earth , for it is the foot@@ stool of his feet ; nor by Jerusalem , for it is the city of the great King .
give to him who asks you , and don '@@ t turn away him who desires to borrow from you .
but I tell you , love your enemies , bless those who curse you , do good to those who hate you , and pray for those who mist@@ re@@ at you and persec@@ ute you ,
" be careful that you don '@@ t do your charitable giving before men , to be seen by them , or else you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven .
therefore when you do mer@@ ciful deeds , don '@@ t sound a trum@@ pet before yourself , as the hypo@@ crit@@ es do in the syn@@ agogues and in the streets , that they may get glory from men . most certainly I tell you , they have received their reward .
" when you pray , you shall not be as the hypo@@ crit@@ es , for they love to stand and pray in the syn@@ agogues and in the corners of the streets , that they may be seen by men . most certainly , I tell you , they have received their reward .
but you , when you pray , enter into your inner room , and having shut your door , pray to your Father who is in secret , and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly .
in praying , don '@@ t use vain repeti@@ tions , as the Genti@@ les do ; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking .
" moreover when you fast , don '@@ t be like the hypo@@ crit@@ es , with sad faces . for they dis@@ figure their faces , that they may be seen by men to be fasting . most certainly I tell you , they have received their reward .
so that you are not seen by men to be fasting , but by your Father who is in secret , and your Father , who sees in secret , will reward you .
" Don '@@ t lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth , where moth and r@@ ust consume , and where thieves break through and steal ;
" the lamp of the body is the eye . if therefore your eye is sound , your whole body will be full of light .
" no one can serve two masters , for either he will hate the one and love the other ; or else he will be devoted to one and desp@@ ise the other . you can '@@ t serve both God and M@@ amm@@ on .
therefore I tell you , don '@@ t be anxious for your life : what you will eat , or what you will drink ; nor yet for your body , what you will wear . is@@ n '@@ t life more than food , and the body more than clothing ?
see the birds of the sky , that they don '@@ t sow , neither do they reap , nor gather into bar@@ ns . your heavenly Father feeds them . are@@ n '@@ t you of much more value than they ?
why are you anxious about clothing ? consider the l@@ ilies of the field , how they grow . they don '@@ t to@@ il , neither do they spin ,
but if God so clothes the grass of the field , which today exists , and tomorrow is thrown into the oven , won '@@ t he much more clo@@ the you , you of little faith ?
for with whatever judgment you judge , you will be judged ; and with whatever measure you measure , it will be measured to you .
why do you see the spec@@ k that is in your brother 's eye , but don '@@ t consider the beam that is in your own eye ?
you hypo@@ cr@@ ite ! first remove the beam out of your own eye , and then you can see clearly to remove the spec@@ k out of your brother 's eye .
" Don '@@ t give that which is holy to the dogs , neither throw your pear@@ ls before the pigs , lest perhaps they tr@@ ample them under their feet , and turn and tear you to pieces .
if you then , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him !
how narrow is the gate , and restricted is the way that leads to life ! few are those who find it .
not everyone who says to me , ' Lord , Lord , ' will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven ; but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven .
" everyone therefore who hears these words of mine , and does them , I will lik@@ en him to a wise man , who built his house on a rock .
behold , a le@@ per came to him and worshi@@ ped him , saying , " Lord , if you want to , you can make me clean . "
Jesus stretched out his hand , and touched him , saying , " I want to . be made clean . " immediately his le@@ pro@@ sy was cleans@@ ed .
Jesus said to him , " See that you tell nobody , but go , show yourself to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses commanded , as a testimony to them . "
and saying , " Lord , my servant lies in the house paralyzed , griev@@ ously tor@@ m@@ ented . "
for I am also a man under authority , having under myself soldiers . I tell this one , ' Go , ' and he goes ; and tell another , ' Come , ' and he comes ; and tell my servant , ' Do this , ' and he does it . "
when Jesus heard it , he marv@@ eled , and said to those who followed , " Most certainly I tell you , I haven '@@ t found so great a faith , not even in Israel .
I tell you that many will come from the east and the west , and will sit down with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob in the Kingdom of Heaven ,
when Jesus came into Peter 's house , he saw his wife 's mother lying sick with a fever .
when evening came , they brought to him many possessed with demons . he cast out the spirits with a word , and healed all who were sick ;
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet , saying : " he took our in@@ firm@@ ities , and bore our diseases . "
Jesus said to him , " The fo@@ xes have holes , and the birds of the sky have ne@@ sts , but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head . "
behold , a violent storm came up on the sea , so much that the boat was covered with the waves , but he was asleep .
he said to them , " Why are you fearful , O you of little faith ? " then he got up , rebu@@ ked the wind and the sea , and there was a great calm .
the men marv@@ eled , saying , " What kind of man is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ? "
when he came to the other side , into the country of the Ger@@ g@@ es@@ en@@ es , two people possessed by demons met him there , coming out of the tom@@ bs , exceedingly fierce , so that nobody could pass that way .
behold , they cried out , saying , " What do we have to do with you , Jesus , Son of God ? have you come here to tor@@ ment us before the time ? "
he said to them , " Go ! " they came out , and went into the herd of pigs : and behold , the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea , and died in the water .
behold , they brought to him a man who was paralyzed , lying on a bed . Jesus , seeing their faith , said to the paraly@@ tic , " Son , che@@ er up ! your sins are forgiven you . "
but that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins ... " ( then he said to the paraly@@ tic ) , " Get up , and take up your mat , and go up to your house . "
but you go and learn what this means : ' I desire mercy , and not sacrifice , ' for I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance . "
then John 's disciples came to him , saying , " Why do we and the Pharis@@ ees fast often , but your disciples don '@@ t fast ? "
Jesus said to them , " Can the friends of the bri@@ deg@@ room mour@@ n , as long as the bri@@ deg@@ room is with them ? but the days will come when the bri@@ deg@@ room will be taken away from them , and then they will fast .
neither do people put new wine into old win@@ es@@ kins , or else the skins would burst , and the wine be spilled , and the skins ruined . no , they put new wine into fresh win@@ es@@ kins , and both are preserved . "
behold , a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years came behind him , and touched the fring@@ e of his garment ;
but Jesus , turning around and seeing her , said , " Dau@@ ghter , che@@ er up ! your faith has made you well . " and the woman was made well from that hour .
when Jesus came into the ruler 's house , and saw the fl@@ ute players , and the crowd in noisy disorder ,
he said to them , " Make room , because the girl is@@ n '@@ t dead , but sleeping . " they were ridicul@@ ing him .
as Jesus passed by from there , two blind men followed him , calling out and saying , " Have mercy on us , son of David ! "
when he had come into the house , the blind men came to him . Jesus said to them , " Do you believe that I am able to do this ? " they told him , " Yes , Lord . "
Jesus went about all the cities and the villages , teaching in their syn@@ agogues , and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom , and healing every disease and every sickness among the people .
now the names of the twelve apostles are these . the first , Simon , who is called Peter ; Andrew , his brother ; James the son of Ze@@ be@@ dee ; John , his brother ;
Philip ; Bar@@ th@@ ol@@ om@@ ew ; Thomas ; Matthew the tax collector ; James the son of Al@@ p@@ ha@@ eus ; Le@@ b@@ ba@@ eus , whose surname was Th@@ add@@ a@@ eus ;
yes , and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake , for a testimony to them and to the nations .
but when they deliver you up , don '@@ t be anxious how or what you will say , for it will be given you in that hour what you will say .
" brother will deliver up brother to death , and the father his child . children will rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death .
but when they persec@@ ute you in this city , flee into the next , for most certainly I tell you , you will not have gone through the cities of Israel , until the Son of Man has come .
what I tell you in the darkness , speak in the light ; and what you hear whispered in the ear , proclaim on the hous@@ et@@ ops .
Don '@@ t be afraid of those who kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul . rather , fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Ge@@ hen@@ na .
he who seeks his life will lose it ; and he who loses his life for my sake will find it .
whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple , most certainly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward . "
it happened that when Jesus had finished directing his twelve disciples , he departed from there to teach and preach in their cities .
as these went their way , Jesus began to say to the multi@@ tudes concerning John , " What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? a re@@ ed shaken by the wind ?
but what did you go out to see ? a man in soft clothing ? behold , those who wear soft clothing are in king 's houses .
but why did you go out ? to see a prophet ? yes , I tell you , and much more than a prophet .
for this is he , of whom it is written , ' Be@@ hold , I send my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way before you . '
the Son of Man came eating and drinking , and they say , ' Be@@ hold , a glut@@ ton@@ ous man and a drun@@ k@@ ard , a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! ' but wisdom is justified by her children . "
" w@@ oe to you , Ch@@ or@@ az@@ in ! w@@ oe to you , Beth@@ s@@ aida ! for if the mighty works had been done in Ty@@ re and Sid@@ on which were done in you , they would have rep@@ ented long ago in s@@ ack@@ cloth and ashes .
but I tell you , it will be more toler@@ able for Ty@@ re and Sid@@ on on the day of judgment than for you .
you , Cap@@ ern@@ au@@ m , who are exalted to heaven , you will go down to H@@ ades . for if the mighty works had been done in So@@ dom which were done in you , it would have remained until this day .
all things have been delivered to me by my Father . no one knows the Son , except the Father ; neither does anyone know the Father , except the Son , and he to whom the Son desires to reveal him .
take my y@@ oke upon you , and learn from me , for I am gentle and low@@ ly in heart ; and you will find rest for your souls .
at that time , Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grain fields . his disciples were hungry and began to pl@@ uck heads of grain and to eat .
but the Pharis@@ ees , when they saw it , said to him , " Be@@ hold , your disciples do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath . "
how he entered into God 's house , and ate the show bread , which was not lawful for him to eat , neither for those who were with him , but only for the priests ?
or have you not read in the law , that on the Sabbath day , the priests in the temple prof@@ ane the Sabbath , and are guil@@ tless ?
but if you had known what this means , ' I desire mercy , and not sacrifice , ' you would not have condemned the guil@@ tless .
and behold there was a man with a with@@ ered hand . they asked him , " Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath day ? " that they might accuse him .
then he told the man , " St@@ ret@@ ch out your hand . " he stretched it out ; and it was restored whole , just like the other .
but the Pharis@@ ees went out , and con@@ spi@@ red against him , how they might destroy him .
" behold , my servant whom I have chosen ; my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased : I will put my Spirit on him . he will proclaim justice to the nations .
he won '@@ t break a bru@@ ised re@@ ed . he won '@@ t qu@@ en@@ ch a smoking fla@@ x , until he leads justice to victory .
then one possessed by a demon , blind and mute , was brought to him and he healed him , so that the blind and mute man both spoke and saw .
but when the Pharis@@ ees heard it , they said , " This man does not cast out demons , except by Be@@ el@@ ze@@ bul , the prince of the demons . "
but if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons , then the Kingdom of God has come upon you .
or how can one enter into the house of the strong man , and pl@@ under his goods , unless he first bind the strong man ? then he will pl@@ under his house .
therefore I tell you , every sin and bl@@ asph@@ emy will be forgiven men , but the bl@@ asph@@ emy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men .
whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man , it will be forgiven him ; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit , it will not be forgiven him , neither in this age , nor in that which is to come .
" either make the tree good , and its fruit good , or make the tree corrupt , and its fruit corrupt ; for the tree is known by its fruit .
for as Jon@@ ah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale , so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
but the un@@ clean spirit , when he is gone out of the man , passes through water@@ less places , seeking rest , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t find it .
then he goes , and takes with himself seven other spirits more evil than he is , and they enter in and dwell there . the last state of that man becomes worse than the first . even so will it be also to this evil generation . "
he spoke to them many things in par@@ ables , saying , " Be@@ hold , a farmer went out to sow .
others fell on rocky ground , where they did@@ n '@@ t have much soil , and immediately they sprang up , because they had no depth of earth .
he answered them , " To you it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven , but it is not given to them .
therefore I speak to them in par@@ ables , because seeing they don '@@ t see , and hearing , they don '@@ t hear , neither do they understand .
in them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled , which says , ' By hearing you will hear , and will in no way understand ; Se@@ eing you will see , and will in no way perceive :
for most certainly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you see , and did@@ n '@@ t see them ; and to hear the things which you hear , and did@@ n '@@ t hear them .
yet he has no root in himself , but endu@@ res for a while . when oppression or persecution arises because of the word , immediately he stum@@ bles .
what was s@@ own among the thor@@ ns , this is he who hears the word , but the cares of this age and the dece@@ it@@ fulness of riches cho@@ ke the word , and he becomes un@@ fruitful .
what was s@@ own on the good ground , this is he who hears the word , and understands it , who most certainly bears fruit , and brings forth , some one hundred times as much , some sixty , and some thirty . "
he set another parable before them , saying , " The Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who s@@ owed good seed in his field ,
but when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit , then the dar@@ nel we@@ eds appeared also .
the servants of the house@@ holder came and said to him , ' Sir , did@@ n '@@ t you sow good seed in your field ? where did this dar@@ nel come from ? '
" he said to them , ' An enemy has done this . ' " the servants asked him , ' Do you want us to go and gather them up ? '
" but he said , ' No , lest perhaps while you gather up the dar@@ nel we@@ eds , you root up the wheat with them .
let both grow together until the harvest , and in the harvest time I will tell the re@@ apers , " First , gather up the dar@@ nel we@@ eds , and bind them in bun@@ dles to burn them ; but gather the wheat into my bar@@ n . " ' "
he set another parable before them , saying , " The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of mu@@ st@@ ard seed , which a man took , and s@@ owed in his field ;
which indeed is smaller than all seeds . but when it is grown , it is greater than the herbs , and becomes a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in its branches . "
he spoke another parable to them . " the Kingdom of Heaven is like yeast , which a woman took , and hid in three measures of meal , until it was all leav@@ ened . "
then Jesus sent the multi@@ tudes away , and went into the house . his disciples came to him , saying , " Expl@@ ain to us the parable of the dar@@ nel we@@ eds of the field . "
the enemy who s@@ owed them is the devil . the harvest is the end of the age , and the re@@ apers are angels .
and will cast them into the furnace of fire . there will be we@@ eping and the gn@@ ashing of teeth .
then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the Kingdom of their Father . he who has ears to hear , let him hear .
" again , the Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field , which a man found , and hid . in his joy , he goes and sells all that he has , and buys that field .
which , when it was filled , they drew up on the beach . they sat down , and gathered the good into containers , but the bad they threw away .
coming into his own country , he taught them in their synagogue , so that they were astonished , and said , " Where did this man get this wisdom , and these mighty works ?
they were offended by him . but Jesus said to them , " A prophet is not without honor , except in his own country , and in his own house . "
and said to his servants , " This is John the Bap@@ tiz@@ er . he is risen from the dead . that is why these powers work in him . "
for Her@@ od had laid hold of John , and bound him , and put him in prison for the sake of Her@@ odi@@ as , his brother Philip 's wife .
when he would have put him to death , he feared the multitude , because they counted him as a prophet .
she , being prompted by her mother , said , " Gi@@ ve me here on a plat@@ ter the head of John the Bap@@ tiz@@ er . "
now when Jesus heard this , he withdrew from there in a boat , to a deserted place apart . when the multi@@ tudes heard it , they followed him on foot from the cities .
when evening had come , his disciples came to him , saying , " This place is deserted , and the hour is already late . send the multi@@ tudes away , that they may go into the villages , and buy themselves food . "
immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat , and to go ahead of him to the other side , while he sent the multi@@ tudes away .
when the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , " It 's a ghost ! " and they cried out for fear .
those who were in the boat came and worshi@@ ped him , saying , " You are truly the Son of God ! "
when the people of that place recognized him , they sent into all that surrounding region , and brought to him all who were sick ,
and they beg@@ ged him that they might just touch the fring@@ e of his garment . as many as touched it were made whole .
" why do your disciples dis@@ obey the tradition of the elders ? for they don '@@ t wash their hands when they eat bread . "
but you say , ' Who@@ ever may tell his father or his mother , " Wh@@ at@@ ever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God , "
leave them alone . they are blind guides of the blind . if the blind guide the blind , both will fall into a pit . "
for out of the heart come forth evil thoughts , murders , adul@@ ter@@ ies , sexual sins , the@@ fts , false testimony , and bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ies .
behold , a Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite woman came out from those borders , and cried , saying , " Have mercy on me , Lord , you son of David ! my daughter is severely demon@@ ized ! "
Jesus departed there , and came near to the sea of Gal@@ ilee ; and he went up into the mountain , and sat there .
Jesus summoned his disciples and said , " I have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat . I don '@@ t want to send them away fasting , or they might faint on the way . "
the disciples said to him , " Where should we get so many lo@@ aves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude ? "
Jesus said to them , " How many lo@@ aves do you have ? " they said , " Seven , and a few small fish . "
and he took the seven lo@@ aves and the fish . he gave thanks and broke them , and gave to the disciples , and the disciples to the multi@@ tudes .
an evil and adul@@ ter@@ ous generation seeks after a sign , and there will be no sign given to it , except the sign of the prophet Jon@@ ah . " he left them , and departed .
then they understood that he did@@ n '@@ t tell them to beware of the yeast of bread , but of the teaching of the Pharis@@ ees and Sad@@ duc@@ ees .
I will give to you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven , and whatever you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven ; and whatever you release on earth will have been released in heaven . "
from that time , Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders , chief priests , and scri@@ bes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up .
Peter took him aside , and began to rebu@@ ke him , saying , " Far be it from you , Lord ! this will never be done to you . "
but he turned , and said to Peter , " Get behind me , Satan ! you are a stumbling block to me , for you are not setting your mind on the things of God , but on the things of men . "
then Jesus said to his disciples , " If anyone desires to come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for what will it profit a man , if he gains the whole world , and forfe@@ its his life ? or what will a man give in exchange for his life ?
most certainly I tell you , there are some standing here who will in no way taste of death , until they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom . "
Peter answered , and said to Jesus , " Lord , it is good for us to be here . if you want , let 's make three tents here : one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . "
while he was still speaking , behold , a bright cloud over@@ shad@@ owed them . behold , a voice came out of the cloud , saying , " This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . listen to him . "
as they were coming down from the mountain , Jesus commanded them , saying , " Don '@@ t tell anyone what you saw , until the Son of Man has risen from the dead . "
but I tell you that Elijah has come already , and they did@@ n '@@ t recognize him , but did to him whatever they wanted to . even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them . "
" Lord , have mercy on my son , for he is ep@@ il@@ ep@@ tic , and suffers griev@@ ously ; for he often falls into the fire , and often into the water .
then the disciples came to Jesus privately , and said , " Why wer@@ en '@@ t we able to cast it out ? "
and they will kill him , and the third day he will be raised up . " they were exceedingly sorry .
when they had come to Cap@@ ern@@ au@@ m , those who collected the di@@ dr@@ ach@@ ma coins came to Peter , and said , " do@@ es@@ n '@@ t your teacher pay the di@@ dr@@ ach@@ ma ? "
Peter said to him , " From strangers . " Jesus said to him , " T@@ herefore the children are exempt .
in that hour the disciples came to Jesus , saying , " Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven ? "
and said , " Most certainly I tell you , unless you turn , and become as little children , you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven .
but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stum@@ ble , it would be better for him that a huge mil@@ l@@ stone should be hung around his neck , and that he should be sunk in the depths of the sea .
if your eye causes you to stum@@ ble , pl@@ uck it out , and cast it from you . it is better for you to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Ge@@ hen@@ na of fire .
see that you don '@@ t desp@@ ise one of these little ones , for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven .
" what do you think ? if a man has one hundred sheep , and one of them goes astr@@ ay , do@@ es@@ n '@@ t he leave the ninety @@@ -@@ @ nine , go to the mountains , and seek that which has gone astr@@ ay ?
" if your brother sins against you , go , show him his fault between you and him alone . if he list@@ ens to you , you have gained back your brother .
but if he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t listen , take one or two more with you , that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established .
if he refuses to listen to them , tell it to the assembly . if he refuses to hear the assembly also , let him be to you as a Genti@@ le or a tax collector .
the lord of that servant , being moved with compassion , released him , and for@@ gave him the debt .
" but that servant went out , and found one of his fellow servants , who owed him one hundred den@@ ari@@ i , and he grabbed him , and took him by the throat , saying , ' Pay me what you owe ! '
" so his fellow servant fell down at his feet and beg@@ ged him , saying , ' Have patience with me , and I will repay you ! '
so when his fellow servants saw what was done , they were exceedingly sorry , and came and told to their lord all that was done .
Sh@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t you also have had mercy on your fellow servant , even as I had mercy on you ? '
his lord was angry , and delivered him to the tor@@ mentors , until he should pay all that was due to him .
they asked him , " Why then did Moses command us to give her a bill of divorce , and divorce her ? "
I tell you that whoever divor@@ ces his wife , except for sexual im@@ morality , and mar@@ ries another , commits adul@@ tery ; and he who mar@@ ries her when she is divorced commits adul@@ tery . "
he said to him , " Why do you call me good ? no one is good but one , that is , God . but if you want to enter into life , keep the commandments . "
the young man said to him , " All these things I have observed from my youth . what do I still lack ? "
Jesus said to him , " If you want to be perfect , go , sell what you have , and give to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; and come , follow me . "
but when the young man heard the saying , he went away sad , for he was one who had great possessions .
Jesus said to his disciples , " Most certainly I say to you , a rich man will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven with difficulty .
looking at them , Jesus said , " With men this is impossible , but with God all things are possible . "
Jesus said to them , " Most certainly I tell you that you who have followed me , in the regeneration when the Son of Man will sit on the throne of his glory , you also will sit on twelve thr@@ ones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
to them he said , ' You also go into the viney@@ ard , and whatever is right I will give you . ' so they went their way .
" they said to him , ' Because no one has hired us . ' " he said to them , ' You also go into the viney@@ ard , and you will receive whatever is right . '
when evening had come , the lord of the viney@@ ard said to his manager , ' Call the laborers and pay them their wages , beginning from the last to the first . '
saying , ' These last have spent one hour , and you have made them equal to us , who have borne the burden of the day and the scor@@ ching heat ! '
take that which is yours , and go your way . it is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you .
is@@ n '@@ t it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own ? or is your eye evil , because I am good ? '
so the last will be first , and the first last . for many are called , but few are chosen . "
as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem , he took the twelve disciples aside , and on the way he said to them ,
" behold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scri@@ bes , and they will condemn him to death ,
he said to her , " What do you want ? " she said to him , " Command that these , my two sons , may sit , one on your right hand , and one on your left hand , in your Kingdom . "
but Jesus summoned them , and said , " You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them , and their great ones exercise authority over them .
behold , two blind men sitting by the road , when they heard that Jesus was passing by , cried out , " Lord , have mercy on us , you son of David ! "
" tell the daughter of Z@@ ion , behold , your King comes to you , humble , and riding on a don@@ key , on a col@@ t , the fo@@ al of a don@@ key . "
and said to him , " Do you hear what these are saying ? " Jesus said to them , " Yes . did you never read , ' Out of the mouth of bab@@ es and nursing babies you have perf@@ ected praise ? ' "
when he had come into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching , and said , " By what authority do you do these things ? who gave you this authority ? "
the baptism of John , where was it from ? from heaven or from men ? " they reasoned with themselves , saying , " If we say , ' From heaven , ' he will ask us , ' Why then did you not believe him ? '
they answered Jesus , and said , " We don '@@ t know . " he also said to them , " N@@ either will I tell you by what authority I do these things .
he came to the second , and said the same thing . he answered , ' I go , sir , ' but he did@@ n '@@ t go .
for John came to you in the way of righteousness , and you did@@ n '@@ t believe him , but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him . when you saw it , you did@@ n '@@ t even repent afterward , that you might believe him .
when the season for the fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the farmers , to receive his fruit .
they told him , " He will miser@@ ably destroy those miserable men , and will lease out the viney@@ ard to other farmers , who will give him the fruit in its season . "
Jesus said to them , " Did you never read in the Scriptures , ' The stone which the builders rejected , the same was made the head of the corner . this was from the Lord . it is marvelous in our eyes ? '
he who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces , but on wh@@ om@@ ever it will fall , it will sc@@ atter him as dust . "
when they sought to seize him , they feared the multi@@ tudes , because they considered him to be a prophet .
and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the marriage feast , but they would not come .
" then he said to his servants , ' The wedding is ready , but those who were invited wer@@ en '@@ t worthy .
but when the king came in to see the guests , he saw there a man who did@@ n '@@ t have on wedding clothing ,
and he said to him , ' Friend , how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing ? ' he was speech@@ less .
'@@ the Lord said to my Lord , sit on my right hand , until I make your enemies a foot@@ stool for your feet ? '
no one was able to answer him a word , neither did any man dare ask him any more questions from that day forth .
but don '@@ t you be called ' Rabbi , ' for one is your teacher , the Christ , and all of you are brothers .
w@@ oe to you , scri@@ bes and Pharis@@ ees , hypo@@ crit@@ es ! for you travel around by sea and land to make one pro@@ sel@@ yte ; and when he becomes one , you make him twice as much of a son of Ge@@ hen@@ na as yourselves .
" w@@ oe to you , you blind guides , who say , ' Who@@ ever sw@@ ears by the temple , it is nothing ; but whoever sw@@ ears by the gold of the temple , he is obligated . '
" w@@ oe to you , scri@@ bes and Pharis@@ ees , hypo@@ crit@@ es ! for you ti@@ the min@@ t , d@@ ill , and Cum@@ in , and have left un@@ done the weigh@@ tier matters of the law : justice , mercy , and faith . but you ought to have done these , and not to have left the other un@@ done .
" w@@ oe to you , scri@@ bes and Pharis@@ ees , hypo@@ crit@@ es ! for you clean the outside of the cup and of the plat@@ ter , but within they are full of extortion and un@@ righteousness .
you blind Pharis@@ ee , first clean the inside of the cup and of the plat@@ ter , that its outside may become clean also .
" w@@ oe to you , scri@@ bes and Pharis@@ ees , hypo@@ crit@@ es ! for you are like whit@@ ened tom@@ bs , which outw@@ ardly appear beautiful , but in@@ war@@ dly are full of dead men 's bones , and of all un@@ clean@@ ness .
and say , ' If we had lived in the days of our fathers , we w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have been part@@ akers with them in the blood of the prophets . '
that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth , from the blood of righteous A@@ bel to the blood of Z@@ ach@@ ari@@ ah son of Bar@@ achi@@ ah , whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar .
" Jerusalem , Jerusalem , who kills the prophets , and stones those who are sent to her ! how often I would have gathered your children together , even as a hen g@@ athers her ch@@ icks under her wings , and you would not !
Jesus went out from the temple , and was going on his way . his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple .
as he sat on the Mount of O@@ lives , the disciples came to him privately , saying , " Tell us , when will these things be ? what is the sign of your coming , and of the end of the age ? "
then they will deliver you up to oppression , and will kill you . you will be hated by all of the nations for my name 's sake .
this Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations , and then the end will come .
" when , therefore , you see the ab@@ om@@ ination of des@@ ol@@ ation , which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet , standing in the holy place ( let the reader understand ) ,
unless those days had been shortened , no flesh would have been saved . but for the sake of the chosen ones , those days will be shortened .
" then if any man tells you , ' Be@@ hold , here is the Christ , ' or , ' There , ' don '@@ t believe it .
if therefore they tell you , ' Be@@ hold , he is in the wilderness , ' don '@@ t go out ; ' Be@@ hold , he is in the inner rooms , ' don '@@ t believe it .
for as the lightning flashes from the east , and is seen even to the west , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
but immediately after the oppression of those days , the sun will be dark@@ ened , the moon will not give its light , the stars will fall from the sky , and the powers of the heavens will be shaken ;
" now from the fi@@ g tree learn this parable . when its branch has now become tender , and puts forth its leaves , you know that the summer is near .
most certainly I tell you , this generation will not pass away , until all these things are accomplished .
for as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking , mar@@ rying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ship ,
and they did@@ n '@@ t know until the flood came , and took them all away , so will be the coming of the Son of Man .
but know this , that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming , he would have watched , and would not have allowed his house to be broken into .
" who then is the faithful and wise servant , whom his lord has set over his household , to give them their food in due season ?
and will cut him in pieces , and appoint his portion with the hypo@@ crit@@ es . there is where the we@@ eping and grinding of teeth will be .
" then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten vir@@ gins , who took their lamps , and went out to meet the bri@@ deg@@ room .
the foolish said to the wise , ' Gi@@ ve us some of your oil , for our lamps are going out . '
but the wise answered , saying , ' What if there is@@ n '@@ t enough for us and you ? you go rather to those who sell , and buy for yourselves . '
while they went away to buy , the bri@@ deg@@ room came , and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast , and the door was shut .
to one he gave five talents , to another two , to another one ; to each according to his own ability . then he went on his journey .
he who received the five talents came and brought another five talents , saying , ' Lord , you delivered to me five talents . behold , I have gained another five talents besides them . '
" his lord said to him , ' Well done , good and faithful servant . you have been faithful over a few things , I will set you over many things . enter into the joy of your lord . '
" his lord said to him , ' Well done , good and faithful servant . you have been faithful over a few things , I will set you over many things . enter into the joy of your lord . '
" he also who had received the one talent came and said , ' Lord , I knew you that you are a hard man , re@@ aping where you did not sow , and gathering where you did not sc@@ atter .
you ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers , and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest .
throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness , where there will be we@@ eping and gn@@ ashing of teeth . '
" but when the Son of Man comes in his glory , and all the holy angels with him , then he will sit on the throne of his glory .
before him all the nations will be gathered , and he will separate them one from another , as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats .
then the King will tell those on his right hand , ' Come , blessed of my Father , inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world ;
for I was hungry , and you gave me food to eat . I was thir@@ sty , and you gave me drink . I was a stranger , and you took me in .
when did we see you as a stranger , and take you in ; or naked , and clo@@ the you ?
" the King will answer them , ' Most certainly I tell you , in@@ as@@ much as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers , you did it to me . '
then he will say also to those on the left hand , ' De@@ part from me , you cur@@ sed , into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels ;
for I was hungry , and you did@@ n '@@ t give me food to eat ; I was thir@@ sty , and you gave me no drink ;
I was a stranger , and you did@@ n '@@ t take me in ; naked , and you did@@ n '@@ t clo@@ the me ; sick , and in prison , and you did@@ n '@@ t visit me . '
" you know that after two days the Pas@@ sover is coming , and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be cruci@@ fied . "
however , knowing this , Jesus said to them , " Why do you trouble the woman ? because she has done a good work for me .
most certainly I tell you , wherever this Good News is preached in the whole world , what this woman has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her . "
then one of the twelve , who was called Jud@@ as Is@@ c@@ ari@@ ot , went to the chief priests ,
they were exceedingly sor@@ row@@ ful , and each began to ask him , " It is@@ n '@@ t me , is it , Lord ? "
Jud@@ as , who betrayed him , answered , " It is@@ n '@@ t me , is it , Rabbi ? " he said to him , " You said it . "
as they were eating , Jesus took bread , gave thanks for it , and broke it . he gave to the disciples , and said , " Take , eat ; this is my body . "
for this is my blood of the new covenant , which is poured out for many for the rem@@ is@@ sion of sins .
but I tell you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on , until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father 's Kingdom . "
but Peter answered him , " Even if all will be made to stum@@ ble because of you , I will never be made to stum@@ ble . "
he went forward a little , fell on his face , and prayed , saying , " My Father , if it is possible , let this cup pass away from me ; nevertheless , not what I desire , but what you desire . "
he came to the disciples , and found them sleeping , and said to Peter , " What , cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t you watch with me for one hour ?
watch and pray , that you don '@@ t enter into temptation . the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak . "
then he came to his disciples , and said to them , " S@@ leep on now , and take your rest . behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
while he was still speaking , behold , Jud@@ as , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multitude with s@@ words and clubs , from the chief priest and elders of the people .
now he who betrayed him gave them a sign , saying , " Who@@ ever I kiss , he is the one . seize him . "
behold , one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck the servant of the high priest , and struck off his ear .
then Jesus said to him , " P@@ ut your sword back into its place , for all those who take the sword will die by the sword .
but all this has happened , that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . " then all the disciples left him , and fled .
but Peter followed him from a distance , to the court of the high priest , and entered in and sat with the officers , to see the end .
the high priest stood up , and said to him , " Have you no answer ? what is this that these testify against you ? "
then the high priest t@@ ore his clothing , saying , " He has spoken bl@@ asph@@ emy ! why do we need any more witnesses ? behold , now you have heard his bl@@ asph@@ emy .
now Peter was sitting outside in the court , and a maid came to him , saying , " You were also with Jesus , the Gal@@ il@@ ean ! "
but he denied it before them all , saying , " I don '@@ t know what you are talking about . "
when he had gone out onto the por@@ ch , someone else saw him , and said to those who were there , " This man also was with Jesus of Naz@@ areth . "
after a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter , " Su@@ rely you are also one of them , for your speech makes you known . "
Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him , " Before the ro@@ o@@ ster crow@@ s , you will deny me three times . " he went out and we@@ pt bit@@ terly .
now when morning had come , all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death :
then Jud@@ as , who betrayed him , when he saw that Jesus was condemned , felt remor@@ se , and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
saying , " I have sin@@ ned in that I betrayed innocent blood . " but they said , " What is that to us ? you see to it . "
he threw down the pieces of silver in the sanctuary , and departed . he went away and han@@ ged himself .
when therefore they were gathered together , Pil@@ ate said to them , " Who@@ m do you want me to release to you ? Bar@@ ab@@ bas , or Jesus , who is called Christ ? "
while he was sitting on the judgment seat , his wife sent to him , saying , " Have nothing to do with that righteous man , for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him . "
now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multi@@ tudes to ask for Bar@@ ab@@ bas , and destroy Jesus .
but the governor answered them , " Which of the two do you want me to release to you ? " they said , " Bar@@ ab@@ bas ! "
they set up over his head the accusation against him written , " TH@@ IS IS J@@ ES@@ US , THE K@@ ING OF THE J@@ E@@ WS . "
and saying , " You who destroy the temple , and build it in three days , save yourself ! if you are the Son of God , come down from the cross ! "
likewise the chief priests also mo@@ cking , with the scri@@ bes , the Pharis@@ ees , and the elders , said ,
" he saved others , but he can '@@ t save himself . if he is the King of Israel , let him come down from the cross now , and we will believe in him .
he trusts in God . let God deliver him now , if he wants him ; for he said , ' I am the Son of God . ' "
about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , " El@@ i , El@@ i , lim@@ a sab@@ ach@@ than@@ i ? " that is , " My God , my God , why have you for@@ s@@ aken me ? "
immediately one of them ran , and took a spon@@ ge , and filled it with vin@@ eg@@ ar , and put it on a re@@ ed , and gave him a drink .
the rest said , " Let him be . let 's see whether Elijah comes to save him . "
behold , the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom . the earth qu@@ aked and the rocks were split .
now the cent@@ ur@@ ion , and those who were with him watching Jesus , when they saw the earthquake , and the things that were done , feared exceedingly , saying , " Tru@@ ly this was the Son of God . "
this man went to Pil@@ ate , and asked for Jesus ' body . then Pil@@ ate commanded the body to be given up .
and laid it in his own new tomb , which he had cut out in the rock , and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb , and departed .
command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day , lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away , and tell the people , ' He is risen from the dead ; ' and the last deception will be worse than the first . "
now after the Sabbath , as it began to dawn on the first day of the week , Mary Mag@@ dal@@ ene and the other Mary came to see the tomb .
behold , there was a great earthquake , for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky , and came and rolled away the stone from the door , and sat on it .
he is not here , for he has risen , just like he said . come , see the place where the Lord was lying .
go quickly and tell his disciples , ' He has risen from the dead , and behold , he goes before you into Gal@@ ilee ; there you will see him . ' behold , I have told you . "
now while they were going , behold , some of the guards came into the city , and told the chief priests all the things that had happened .
so they took the money and did as they were told . this saying was spread abroad among the Jews , and continues until this day .
go , and make disciples of all nations , bap@@ tizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit ,
all the country of Ju@@ dea and all those of Jerusalem went out to him . they were baptized by him in the Jordan river , conf@@ essing their sins .
he preached , saying , " After me comes he who is mi@@ gh@@ tier than I , the th@@ ong of whose sand@@ als I am not worthy to st@@ oop down and lo@@ osen .
a voice came out of the sky , " You are my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . "
now after John was taken into custody , Jesus came into Gal@@ ilee , preaching the Good News of the Kingdom of God ,
they were all amazed , so that they questioned among themselves , saying , " What is this ? a new teaching ? for with authority he commands even the un@@ clean spirits , and they obey him ! "
he said to them , " Let 's go elsewhere into the next towns , that I may preach there also , because I came out for this reason . "
a le@@ per came to him , begging him , kne@@ eling down to him , and saying to him , " If you want to , you can make me clean . "
and said to him , " See you say nothing to anybody , but go show yourself to the priest , and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded , for a testimony to them . "
but he went out , and began to proclaim it much , and to spread about the matter , so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city , but was outside in desert places : and they came to him from everywhere .
immediately many were gathered together , so that there was no more room , not even around the door ; and he spoke the word to them .
when they could not come near to him for the crowd , they removed the roof where he was . when they had broken it up , they let down the mat that the paraly@@ tic was lying on .
which is easier , to tell the paraly@@ tic , ' Your sins are forgiven ; ' or to say , ' A@@ rise , and take up your bed , and walk ? '
he arose , and immediately took up the mat , and went out in front of them all ; so that they were all amazed , and glori@@ fied God , saying , " We never saw anything like this ! "
as he passed by , he saw Lev@@ i , the son of Al@@ p@@ ha@@ eus , sitting at the tax office , and he said to him , " Fol@@ low me . " and he arose and followed him .
it happened , that he was re@@ cl@@ ining at the table in his house , and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples , for there were many , and they followed him .
the scri@@ bes and the Pharis@@ ees , when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors , said to his disciples , " Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners ? "
Jesus said to them , " Can the gro@@ om@@ smen fast while the bri@@ deg@@ room is with them ? as long as they have the bri@@ deg@@ room with them , they can '@@ t fast .
but the days will come when the bri@@ deg@@ room will be taken away from them , and then will they fast in that day .
no one se@@ ws a piece of un@@ shrunk cloth on an old garment , or else the patch shr@@ inks and the new tears away from the old , and a worse hole is made .
no one puts new wine into old win@@ es@@ kins , or else the new wine will burst the skins , and the wine p@@ ours out , and the skins will be destroyed ; but they put new wine into fresh win@@ es@@ kins . "
the Pharis@@ ees said to him , " Be@@ hold , why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day ? "
how he entered into God 's house when A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar was high priest , and ate the show bread , which is not lawful to eat except for the priests , and gave also to those who were with him ? "
when he had looked around at them with anger , being griev@@ ed at the hard@@ ening of their hearts , he said to the man , " St@@ ret@@ ch out your hand . " he stretched it out , and his hand was restored as healthy as the other .
he spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd , so that they w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t press on him .
the un@@ clean spirits , whenever they saw him , fell down before him , and cried , " You are the Son of God ! "
James the son of Ze@@ be@@ dee ; John , the brother of James , and he sur@@ named them Bo@@ an@@ er@@ ges , which means , S@@ ons of Th@@ under ;
Andrew ; Philip ; Bar@@ th@@ ol@@ om@@ ew ; Matthew ; Thomas ; James , the son of Al@@ p@@ ha@@ eus ; Th@@ add@@ a@@ eus ; Simon the Zeal@@ ot ;
the scri@@ bes who came down from Jerusalem said , " He has Be@@ el@@ ze@@ bul , " and , " By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons . "
but no one can enter into the house of the strong man to pl@@ under , unless he first bin@@ ds the strong man ; and then he will pl@@ under his house .
most certainly I tell you , all sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven , including their bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ies with which they may bl@@ asph@@ eme ;
looking around at those who sat around him , he said , " Be@@ hold , my mother and my brothers !
again he began to teach by the seaside . a great multitude was gathered to him , so that he entered into a boat in the sea , and sat down . all the multitude were on the land by the sea .
others fell on the rocky ground , where it had little soil , and immediately it sprang up , because it had no depth of soil .
others fell into the good ground , and yielded fruit , growing up and increasing . some brought forth thirty times , some sixty times , and some one hundred times as much . "
that ' seeing they may see , and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest perhaps they should turn again , and their sins should be forgiven them . ' "
he said to them , " Don '@@ t you understand this parable ? how will you understand all of the par@@ ables ?
the ones by the road are the ones where the word is s@@ own ; and when they have heard , immediately Satan comes , and takes away the word which has been s@@ own in them .
these in the same way are those who are s@@ own on the rocky places , who , when they have heard the word , immediately receive it with joy .
those which were s@@ own on the good ground are those who hear the word , and accept it , and bear fruit , some thirty times , some sixty times , and some one hundred times . "
for there is nothing hidden , except that it should be made known ; neither was anything made secret , but that it should come to light .
he said to them , " Take heed what you hear . with whatever measure you measure , it will be measured to you , and more will be given to you who hear .
yet when it is s@@ own , grows up , and becomes greater than all the herbs , and puts out great branches , so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow . "
with many such par@@ ables he spoke the word to them , as they were able to hear it .
a big wind storm arose , and the waves beat into the boat , so much that the boat was already filled .
he himself was in the stern , asleep on the cushion , and they woke him up , and told him , " Teacher , don '@@ t you care that we are dying ? "
he aw@@ oke , and rebu@@ ked the wind , and said to the sea , " Peace ! be still ! " the wind ceased , and there was a great calm .
he said to them , " Why are you so afraid ? how is it that you have no faith ? "
they were greatly afraid , and said to one another , " Who then is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ? "
because he had been often bound with fet@@ ters and chains , and the chains had been torn apart by him , and the fet@@ ters broken in pieces . nobody had the strength to tame him .
always , night and day , in the tom@@ bs and in the mountains , he was crying out , and cutting himself with stones .
at once Jesus gave them permission . the un@@ clean spirits came out and entered into the pigs . the herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea , and they were drowned in the sea .
those who fed them fled , and told it in the city and in the country . the people came to see what it was that had happened .
they came to Jesus , and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting , clo@@ thed , and in his right mind , even him who had the legi@@ on ; and they were afraid .
those who saw it declared to them how it happened to him who was possessed by demons , and about the pigs .
as he was entering into the boat , he who had been possessed by demons beg@@ ged him that he might be with him .
he went his way , and began to proclaim in Dec@@ apolis how Jesus had done great things for him , and everyone marv@@ eled .
when Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side , a great multitude was gathered to him ; and he was by the sea .
and beg@@ ged him much , saying , " My little daughter is at the point of death . please come and lay your hands on her , that she may be made healthy , and live . "
having heard the things concerning Jesus , came up behind him in the crowd , and touched his clothes .
his disciples said to him , " You see the multitude pressing against you , and you say , ' Who touched me ? ' "
while he was still speaking , people came from the synagogue ruler 's house saying , " Your daughter is dead . why bother the Teacher any more ? "
he came to the synagogue ruler 's house , and he saw an upro@@ ar , we@@ eping , and great w@@ ailing .
they ridicul@@ ed him . but he , having put them all out , took the father of the child , her mother , and those who were with him , and went in where the child was lying .
is@@ n '@@ t this the carp@@ enter , the son of Mary , and brother of James , Jos@@ es , Jud@@ ah , and Simon ? are@@ n '@@ t his sisters here with us ? " they were offended at him .
Jesus said to them , " A prophet is not without honor , except in his own country , and among his own relatives , and in his own house . "
he could do no mighty work there , except that he laid his hands on a few sick people , and healed them .
he called to himself the twelve , and began to send them out two by two ; and he gave them authority over the un@@ clean spirits .
King Her@@ od heard this , for his name had become known , and he said , " John the Bap@@ tiz@@ er has risen from the dead , and therefore these powers are at work in him . "
but others said , " He is Elijah . " others said , " He is a prophet , or like one of the prophets . "
but Her@@ od , when he heard this , said , " This is John , whom I be@@ headed . he has risen from the dead . "
for Her@@ od feared John , knowing that he was a righteous and holy man , and kept him safe . when he heard him , he did many things , and he heard him gladly .
he s@@ wore to her , " Wh@@ at@@ ever you shall ask of me , I will give you , up to half of my kingdom . "
she came in immediately with ha@@ ste to the king , and asked , " I want you to give me right now the head of John the Bap@@ tiz@@ er on a plat@@ ter . "
the apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus , and they told him all things , whatever they had done , and whatever they had taught .
he said to them , " You come apart into a deserted place , and rest a@@ while . " for there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat .
send them away , that they may go into the surrounding country and villages , and buy themselves bread , for they have nothing to eat . "
but he answered them , " You give them something to eat . " they asked him , " Sh@@ all we go and buy two hundred den@@ ari@@ i worth of bread , and give them something to eat ? "
he said to them , " How many lo@@ aves do you have ? go see . " when they knew , they said , " Five , and two fish . "
he took the five lo@@ aves and the two fish , and looking up to heaven , he blessed and broke the lo@@ aves , and he gave to his disciples to set before them , and he divided the two fish among them all .
immediately he made his disciples get into the boat , and to go ahead to the other side , to Beth@@ s@@ aida , while he himself sent the multitude away .
seeing them distressed in rowing , for the wind was contrary to them , about the fourth watch of the night he came to them , walking on the sea , and he would have passed by them ,
for they all saw him , and were troubled . but he immediately spoke with them , and said to them , " Che@@ er up ! it is I ! Don '@@ t be afraid . "
and ran around that whole region , and began to bring those who were sick , on their mats , to where they heard he was .
then the Pharis@@ ees , and some of the scri@@ bes gathered together to him , having come from Jerusalem .
they don '@@ t eat when they come from the marketplace , unless they ba@@ the themselves , and there are many other things , which they have received to hold to : wash@@ ings of cups , p@@ itch@@ ers , bronze vessels , and cou@@ ches . )
the Pharis@@ ees and the scri@@ bes asked him , " Why don '@@ t your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders , but eat their bread with un@@ washed hands ? "
" for you set aside the commandment of God , and hold tightly to the tradition of men@@ -@@ -@@ the washing of p@@ itch@@ ers and cups , and you do many other such things . "
making void the word of God by your tradition , which you have handed down . you do many things like this . "
there is nothing from outside of the man , that going into him can def@@ ile him ; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that def@@ ile the man .
for from within , out of the hearts of men , proceed evil thoughts , adul@@ ter@@ ies , sexual sins , murders , the@@ fts ,
from there he arose , and went away into the borders of Ty@@ re and Sid@@ on . he entered into a house , and did@@ n '@@ t want anyone to know it , but he cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t escape notice .
now the woman was a Greek , a Sy@@ ro@@ pho@@ en@@ ician by race . she beg@@ ged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter .
he said to her , " For this saying , go your way . the demon has gone out of your daughter . "
he commanded them that they should tell no one , but the more he commanded them , so much the more widely they proclaimed it .
they were astonished beyond measure , saying , " He has done all things well . he makes even the deaf hear , and the mute speak ! "
in those days , when there was a very great multitude , and they had nothing to eat , Jesus called his disciples to himself , and said to them ,
" I have compassion on the multitude , because they have stayed with me now three days , and have nothing to eat .
if I send them away fasting to their home , they will faint on the way , for some of them have come a long way . "
he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground , and he took the seven lo@@ aves . having given thanks , he broke them , and gave them to his disciples to serve , and they served the multitude .
he sigh@@ ed deeply in his spirit , and said , " Why does this generation seek a sign ? most certainly I tell you , no sign will be given to this generation . "
he warned them , saying , " Take heed : beware of the yeast of the Pharis@@ ees and the yeast of Her@@ od . "
when I broke the five lo@@ aves among the five thousand , how many bas@@ kets full of broken pieces did you take up ? " they told him , " T@@ wel@@ ve . "
he took hold of the blind man by the hand , and brought him out of the village . when he had sp@@ it on his eyes , and laid his hands on him , he asked him if he saw anything .
he sent him away to his house , saying , " Don '@@ t enter into the village , nor tell anyone in the village . "
Jesus went out , with his disciples , into the villages of Caes@@ area Philipp@@ i . on the way he asked his disciples , " Who do men say that I am ? "
he said to them , " But who do you say that I am ? " Peter answered , " You are the Christ . "
he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders , the chief priests , and the scri@@ bes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
but he , turning around , and seeing his disciples , rebu@@ ked Peter , and said , " Get behind me , Satan ! for you have in mind not the things of God , but the things of men . "
he called the multitude to himself with his disciples , and said to them , " Who@@ ever wants to come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for whoever wants to save his life will lose it ; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it .
he said to them , " Most certainly I tell you , there are some standing here who will in no way taste death until they see the Kingdom of God come with power . "
after six days Jesus took with him Peter , James , and John , and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves , and he was changed into another form in front of them .
Peter answered Jesus , " Rabbi , it is good for us to be here . let 's make three tents : one for you , one for Moses , and one for Elijah . "
as they were coming down from the mountain , he commanded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen , until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead .
but I tell you that Elijah has come , and they have also done to him whatever they wanted to , even as it is written about him . "
and wherever it se@@ izes him , it throws him down , and he fo@@ ams at the mouth , and grin@@ ds his teeth , and wastes away . I asked your disciples to cast it out , and they wer@@ en '@@ t able . "
they brought him to him , and when he saw him , immediately the spirit convul@@ sed him , and he fell on the ground , w@@ allowing and fo@@ aming at the mouth .
he asked his father , " How long has it been since this has come to him ? " he said , " From childhood .
often it has cast him both into the fire and into the water , to destroy him . but if you can do anything , have compassion on us , and help us . "
when Jesus saw that a multitude came running together , he rebu@@ ked the un@@ clean spirit , saying to him , " You mute and deaf spirit , I command you , come out of him , and never enter him again ! "
having cried out , and convul@@ sed greatly , it came out of him . the boy became like one dead ; so much that most of them said , " He is dead . "
he took a little child , and set him in their midst . taking him in his arms , he said to them ,
for whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name , because you are Christ 's , most certainly I tell you , he will in no way lose his reward .
whoever will cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stum@@ ble , it would be better for him if he were thrown into the sea with a mil@@ l@@ stone hung around his neck .
if your hand causes you to stum@@ ble , cut it off . it is better for you to enter into life ma@@ im@@ ed , rather than having your two hands to go into Ge@@ hen@@ na , into the un@@ qu@@ en@@ ch@@ able fire ,
if your foot causes you to stum@@ ble , cut it off . it is better for you to enter into life lame , rather than having your two feet to be cast into Ge@@ hen@@ na , into the fire that will never be qu@@ en@@ ch@@ ed@@ --
if your eye causes you to stum@@ ble , cast it out . it is better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Ge@@ hen@@ na of fire ,
salt is good , but if the salt has lost its sal@@ t@@ iness , with what will you season it ? have salt in yourselves , and be at peace with one another . "
he arose from there and came into the borders of Ju@@ dea and beyond the Jordan . multi@@ tudes came together to him again . as he usually did , he was again teaching them .
they were bringing to him little children , that he should touch them , but the disciples rebu@@ ked those who were bringing them .
as he was going out into the way , one ran to him , kn@@ elt before him , and asked him , " Good Teacher , what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life ? "
the disciples were amazed at his words . but Jesus answered again , " Children , how hard is it for those who trust in riches to enter into the Kingdom of God !
Jesus , looking at them , said , " With men it is impossible , but not with God , for all things are possible with God . "
" behold , we are going up to Jerusalem . the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scri@@ bes . they will condemn him to death , and will deliver him to the Genti@@ les .
James and John , the sons of Ze@@ be@@ dee , came near to him , saying , " Teacher , we want you to do for us whatever we will ask . "
but Jesus said to them , " You don '@@ t know what you are asking . are you able to drink the cup that I drink , and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? "
they said to him , " We are able . " Jesus said to them , " You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink , and you shall be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ;
but to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give , but for whom it has been prepared . "
Jesus summoned them , and said to them , " You know that they who are recognized as rulers over the nations lord it over them , and their great ones exercise authority over them .
they came to Jer@@ ich@@ o . as he went out from Jer@@ ich@@ o , with his disciples and a great multitude , the son of Tim@@ a@@ eus , Bar@@ tim@@ a@@ eus , a blind beg@@ gar , was sitting by the road .
Jesus asked him , " What do you want me to do for you ? " the blind man said to him , " Rab@@ bon@@ i , that I may see again . "
Jesus said to him , " Go your way . your faith has made you well . " immediately he received his sight , and followed Jesus in the way .
and said to them , " Go your way into the village that is opposite you . immediately as you enter into it , you will find a young don@@ key tied , on which no one has sat . unti@@ e him , and bring him .
if anyone asks you , ' Why are you doing this ? ' say , ' The Lord needs him ; ' and immediately he will send him back here . "
some of those who stood there asked them , " What are you doing , un@@ t@@ ying the young don@@ key ? "
the chief priests and the scri@@ bes heard it , and sought how they might destroy him . for they feared him , because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching .
whenever you stand praying , forgive , if you have anything against anyone ; so that your Father , who is in heaven , may also forgive you your trans@@ gres@@ sions .
they came again to Jerusalem , and as he was walking in the temple , the chief priests , and the scri@@ bes , and the elders came to him ,
they reasoned with themselves , saying , " If we should say , ' From heaven ; ' he will say , ' Why then did you not believe him ? '
haven '@@ t you even read this Scripture : ' the stone which the builders rejected , the same was made the head of the corner .
they tried to seize him , but they feared the multitude ; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them . they left him , and went away .
one of the scri@@ bes came , and heard them questioning together . knowing that he had answered them well , asked him , " Which commandment is the greatest of all ? "
you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , and with all your soul , and with all your mind , and with all your strength . ' this is the first commandment .
the second is like this , ' You shall love your neighbor as yourself . ' there is no other commandment greater than these . "
and to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbor as himself , is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices . "
when Jesus saw that he answered wisely , he said to him , " You are not far from the Kingdom of God . " no one dared ask him any question after that .
Jesus responded , as he taught in the temple , " How is it that the scri@@ bes say that the Christ is the son of David ?
for David himself said in the Holy Spirit , ' The Lord said to my Lord , " S@@ it at my right hand , until I make your enemies the foot@@ stool of your feet . " '
in his teaching he said to them , " B@@ ew@@ are of the scri@@ bes , who like to walk in long robes , and to get greetings in the market@@ places ,
Jesus sat down opposite the treasury , and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury . many who were rich cast in much .
he called his disciples to himself , and said to them , " Most certainly I tell you , this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury ,
as he went out of the temple , one of his disciples said to him , " Teacher , see what kind of stones and what kind of buildings ! "
Jesus said to him , " Do you see these great buildings ? there will not be left here one stone on another , which will not be thrown down . "
" tell us , when will these things be ? what is the sign that these things are all about to be fulfilled ? "
when they lead you away and deliver you up , don '@@ t be anxious beforehand , or pre@@ meditate what you will say , but say whatever will be given you in that hour . for it is not you who speak , but the Holy Spirit .
" brother will deliver up brother to death , and the father his child . children will rise up against parents , and cause them to be put to death .
but when you see the ab@@ om@@ ination of des@@ ol@@ ation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , standing where it ought not ( let the reader understand ) , then let those who are in Ju@@ dea flee to the mountains ,
for in those days there will be oppression , such as there has not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now , and never will be .
unless the Lord had shortened the days , no flesh would have been saved ; but for the sake of the chosen ones , whom he picked out , he shortened the days .
" now from the fi@@ g tree , learn this parable . when the branch has now become tender , and puts forth its leaves , you know that the summer is near ;
even so you also , when you see these things coming to pass , know that it is near , at the doors .
" it is like a man , traveling to another country , having left his house , and given authority to his servants , and to each one his work , and also commanded the door@@ keeper to keep watch .
watch therefore , for you don '@@ t know when the lord of the house is coming , whether at evening , or at midnight , or when the ro@@ o@@ ster crow@@ s , or in the morning ;
for they said , " Not during the feast , because there might be a riot of the people . "
while he was at Beth@@ any , in the house of Simon the le@@ per , as he sat at the table , a woman came having an al@@ ab@@ aster jar of o@@ int@@ ment of pure nar@@ d@@ -@@ -@@ very costly . she broke the jar , and poured it over his head .
but there were some who were indig@@ n@@ ant among themselves , saying , " Why has this o@@ int@@ ment been wasted ?
for you always have the poor with you , and whenever you want to , you can do them good ; but you will not always have me .
most certainly I tell you , wherever this Good News may be preached throughout the whole world , that which this woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her . "
Jud@@ as Is@@ c@@ ari@@ ot , who was one of the twelve , went away to the chief priests , that he might deliver him to them .
on the first day of un@@ leav@@ ened bread , when they sacrificed the Pas@@ sover , his disciples asked him , " Where do you want us to go and prepare that you may eat the Pas@@ sover ? "
he sent two of his disciples , and said to them , " Go into the city , and there you will meet a man carrying a p@@ itch@@ er of water . follow him ,
and wherever he enters in , tell the master of the house , ' The Teacher says , " Where is the guest room , where I may eat the Pas@@ sover with my disciples ? " '
they began to be sor@@ row@@ ful , and to ask him one by one , " Su@@ rely not I ? " and another said , " Su@@ rely not I ? "
as they were eating , Jesus took bread , and when he had blessed , he broke it , and gave to them , and said , " Take , eat . this is my body . "
he said to them , " This is my blood of the new covenant , which is poured out for many .
most certainly I tell you , I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it anew in the Kingdom of God . "
Jesus said to him , " Most certainly I tell you , that you today , even this night , before the ro@@ o@@ ster crow@@ s twice , you will deny me three times . "
he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass away from him .
he said , " Ab@@ ba , Father , all things are possible to you . please remove this cup from me . however , not what I desire , but what you desire . "
watch and pray , that you may not enter into temptation . the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak . "
now he who betrayed him had given them a sign , saying , " wh@@ om@@ ever I will kiss , that is he . seize him , and lead him away safely . "
I was daily with you in the temple teaching , and you did@@ n '@@ t arrest me . but this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled . "
a certain young man followed him , having a linen cloth thrown around himself , over his naked body . the young men grabbed him ,
they led Jesus away to the high priest . all the chief priests , the elders , and the scri@@ bes came together with him .
" we heard him say , ' I will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and in three days I will build another made without hands . ' "
the high priest stood up in the midst , and asked Jesus , " Have you no answer ? what is it which these testify against you ? "
but he stayed quiet , and answered nothing . again the high priest asked him , " Are you the Christ , the Son of the Bless@@ ed ? "
you have heard the bl@@ asph@@ emy ! what do you think ? " they all condemned him to be worthy of death .
some began to sp@@ it on him , and to cover his face , and to beat him with fi@@ sts , and to tell him , " Proph@@ esy ! " the officers struck him with the pal@@ ms of their hands .
as Peter was in the courtyard below , one of the m@@ aids of the high priest came ,
and seeing Peter warming himself , she looked at him , and said , " You were also with the Naz@@ aren@@ e , Jesus ! "
but he again denied it . after a little while again those who stood by said to Peter , " You truly are one of them , for you are a Gal@@ il@@ ean , and your speech shows it . "
but he began to curse , and to swear , " I don '@@ t know this man of whom you speak ! "
the ro@@ o@@ ster crow@@ ed the second time . Peter remembered the word , how that Jesus said to him , " Before the ro@@ o@@ ster crow@@ s twice , you will deny me three times . " when he thought about that , he we@@ pt .
but the chief priests stirred up the multitude , that he should release Bar@@ ab@@ bas to them instead .
Pil@@ ate said to them , " Why , what evil has he done ? " but they cried out exceedingly , " Cru@@ ci@@ fy him ! "
Pil@@ ate , wishing to please the multitude , released Bar@@ ab@@ bas to them , and handed over Jesus , when he had flo@@ gged him , to be cruci@@ fied .
when they had mo@@ cked him , they took the purple off of him , and put his own garments on him . they led him out to cruci@@ fy him .
those who passed by bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed him , w@@ agging their heads , and saying , " H@@ a ! you who destroy the temple , and build it in three days ,
let the Christ , the King of Israel , now come down from the cross , that we may see and believe him . " those who were cruci@@ fied with him insul@@ ted him .
at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , " E@@ lo@@ i , E@@ lo@@ i , l@@ ama sab@@ ach@@ than@@ i ? " which is , being interpreted , " My God , my God , why have you for@@ s@@ aken me ? "
when the cent@@ ur@@ ion , who stood by opposite him , saw that he cried out like this and breath@@ ed his last , he said , " Tru@@ ly this man was the Son of God ! "
Joseph of Ari@@ ma@@ th@@ a@@ ea , a prominent council member who also himself was looking for the Kingdom of God , came . he boldly went in to Pil@@ ate , and asked for Jesus ' body .
he bought a linen cloth , and taking him down , wound him in the linen cloth , and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock . he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb .
he said to them , " Don '@@ t be amazed . you seek Jesus , the Naz@@ aren@@ e , who has been cruci@@ fied . he has risen . he is not here . behold , the place where they laid him !
they went out , and fled from the tomb , for trembling and aston@@ ishment had come on them . they said nothing to anyone ; for they were afraid .
after these things he was revealed in another form to two of them , as they walked , on their way into the country .
these signs will accompany those who believe : in my name they will cast out demons ; they will speak with new languages ;
they will take up ser@@ p@@ ents ; and if they drink any deadly thing , it will in no way hurt them ; they will lay hands on the sick , and they will recover . "
they went out , and preached everywhere , the Lord working with them , and confirming the word by the signs that followed . A@@ men .
even as those who from the beginning were eye@@ witnesses and servants of the word delivered them to us ,
according to the custom of the priest 's office , his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn inc@@ ense .
but the angel said to him , " Don '@@ t be afraid , Z@@ ach@@ ari@@ as , because your request has been heard , and your wife , Elizabeth , will bear you a son , and you shall call his name John .
the angel answered him , " I am Gabriel , who stands in the presence of God . I was sent to speak to you , and to bring you this good news .
it happened , when the days of his service were fulfilled , he departed to his house .
to a virgin pledged to be married to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David . the virgin 's name was Mary .
having come in , the angel said to her , " Re@@ jo@@ ice , you highly favored one ! the Lord is with you . blessed are you among women ! "
behold , you will conceive in your womb , and bring forth a son , and will call his name ' Jesus . '
behold , Elizabeth , your relative , also has conceived a son in her old age ; and this is the sixth month with her who was called bar@@ ren .
it happened , when Elizabeth heard Mary 's greeting , that the baby le@@ aped in her womb , and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit .
she called out with a loud voice , and said , " Bless@@ ed are you among women , and blessed is the fruit of your womb !
for behold , when the voice of your greeting came into my ears , the baby le@@ aped in my womb for joy !
he asked for a writing tablet , and wrote , " His name is John . " they all marv@@ eled .
all who heard them laid them up in their heart , saying , " What then will this child be ? " the hand of the Lord was with him .
Joseph also went up from Gal@@ ilee , out of the city of Naz@@ areth , into Ju@@ dea , to the city of David , which is called Bethlehem , because he was of the house and family of David ;
she brought forth her fir@@ st@@ born son , and she wrapped him in bands of cloth , and laid him in a feeding tr@@ ough , because there was no room for them in the inn .
when eight days were fulfilled for the circum@@ cision of the child , his name was called Jesus , which was given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled , they brought him up to Jerusalem , to present him to the Lord
behold , there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Sim@@ eon . this man was righteous and dev@@ out , looking for the consolation of Israel , and the Holy Spirit was on him .
it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord 's Christ .
he came in the Spirit into the temple . when the parents brought in the child , Jesus , that they might do concerning him according to the custom of the law ,
and Sim@@ eon blessed them , and said to Mary , his mother , " Be@@ hold , this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel , and for a sign which is spoken against .
there was one Anna , a proph@@ et@@ ess , the daughter of P@@ han@@ u@@ el , of the tribe of Ash@@ er ( she was of a great age , having lived with a husband seven years from her vir@@ g@@ inity ,
coming up at that very hour , she gave thanks to the Lord , and spoke of him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem .
and when they had fulfilled the days , as they were returning , the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem . Joseph and his mother did@@ n '@@ t know it ,
but sup@@ posing him to be in the company , they went a day 's journey , and they looked for him among their relatives and acquaintances .
when they saw him , they were astonished , and his mother said to him , " Son , why have you treated us this way ? behold , your father and I were anxi@@ ously looking for you . "
now in the fif@@ teenth year of the reign of Ti@@ b@@ eri@@ us Caes@@ ar , Pon@@ ti@@ us Pil@@ ate being governor of Ju@@ dea , and Her@@ od being te@@ tr@@ arch of Gal@@ ilee , and his brother Philip te@@ tr@@ arch of the region of I@@ tur@@ a@@ ea and Tr@@ ach@@ on@@ itis , and L@@ ys@@ ani@@ as te@@ tr@@ arch of A@@ bil@@ ene ,
in the high priesthood of Ann@@ as and C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has , the word of God came to John , the son of Z@@ ach@@ ari@@ as , in the wilderness .
every valley will be filled . every mountain and hill will be brought low . the cro@@ oked will become straight , and the rough ways smooth .
bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and don '@@ t begin to say among yourselves , ' We have Abraham for our father ; ' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones !
he answered them , " He who has two coats , let him give to him who has none . he who has food , let him do likewise . "
John answered them all , " I indeed bap@@ ti@@ ze you with water , but he comes who is mi@@ gh@@ tier than I , the lat@@ ch@@ et of whose sand@@ als I am not worthy to lo@@ osen . he will bap@@ ti@@ ze you in the Holy Spirit and fire ,
and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily form as a do@@ ve on him ; and a voice came out of the sky , saying " You are my beloved Son . in you I am well pleased . "
Jesus himself , when he began to teach , was about thirty years old , being the son ( as was supposed ) of Joseph , the son of Hel@@ i ,
Jesus , full of the Holy Spirit , returned from the Jordan , and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness
the devil said to him , " If you are the Son of God , command this stone to become bread . "
Jesus answered him , saying , " It is written , ' Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of God . ' "
the devil , leading him up on a high mountain , showed him all the king@@ doms of the world in a moment of time .
the devil said to him , " I will give you all this authority , and their glory , for it has been delivered to me ; and I give it to wh@@ om@@ ever I want .
Jesus answered him , " Get behind me Satan ! for it is written , ' You shall worship the Lord your God , and you shall serve him only . ' "
he led him to Jerusalem , and set him on the pin@@ n@@ acle of the temple , and said to him , " If you are the Son of God , cast yourself down from here ,
he came to Naz@@ areth , where he had been brought up . he entered , as was his custom , into the synagogue on the Sabbath day , and stood up to read .
the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him . he opened the book , and found the place where it was written ,
he closed the book , gave it back to the attendant , and sat down . the eyes of all in the synagogue were fast@@ ened on him .
all testified about him , and wondered at the gr@@ acious words which proceeded out of his mouth , and they said , " is@@ n '@@ t this Joseph 's son ? "
but truly I tell you , there were many wid@@ ows in Israel in the days of Elijah , when the sky was shut up three years and six months , when a great famine came over all the land .
Elijah was sent to none of them , except to Z@@ are@@ ph@@ ath , in the land of Sid@@ on , to a woman who was a widow .
there were many le@@ pers in Israel in the time of Elis@@ ha the prophet , yet not one of them was cleans@@ ed , except Na@@ aman , the Syrian . "
they rose up , threw him out of the city , and led him to the bro@@ w of the hill that their city was built on , that they might throw him off the cliff .
Jesus rebu@@ ked him , saying , " Be silent , and come out of him ! " when the demon had thrown him down in their midst , he came out of him , having done him no harm .
amaz@@ ement came on all , and they spoke together , one with another , saying , " What is this word ? for with authority and power he commands the un@@ clean spirits , and they come out ! "
he rose up from the synagogue , and entered into Simon 's house . Simon 's mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law was afflicted with a great fever , and they beg@@ ged him for her .
when the sun was setting , all those who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and healed them .
demons also came out from many , crying out , and saying , " You are the Christ , the Son of God ! " rebu@@ king them , he did@@ n '@@ t allow them to speak , because they knew that he was the Christ .
when it was day , he departed and went into an un@@ inhabited place , and the multi@@ tudes looked for him , and came to him , and held on to him , so that he w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t go away from them .
now it happened , while the multitude pressed on him and heard the word of God , that he was standing by the lake of Gen@@ nes@@ aret .
he entered into one of the boats , which was Simon 's , and asked him to put out a little from the land . he sat down and taught the multi@@ tudes from the boat .
but Simon Peter , when he saw it , fell down at Jesus ' knees , saying , " De@@ part from me , for I am a sinful man , Lord . "
he stretched out his hand , and touched him , saying , " I want to . be made clean . " immediately the le@@ pro@@ sy left him .
he commanded him to tell no one , " But go your way , and show yourself to the priest , and offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded , for a testimony to them . "
not finding a way to bring him in because of the multitude , they went up to the hous@@ et@@ op , and let him down through the tiles with his cot into the midst before Jesus .
the scri@@ bes and the Pharis@@ ees began to reason , saying , " Who is this that speaks bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ies ? who can forgive sins , but God alone ? "
which is easier to say , ' Your sins are forgiven you ; ' or to say , ' A@@ rise and walk ? '
but that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins " ( he said to the paralyzed man ) , " I tell you , arise , and take up your cot , and go to your house . "
amaz@@ ement took hold on all , and they glori@@ fied God . they were filled with fear , saying , " We have seen strange things today . "
after these things he went out , and saw a tax collector named Lev@@ i sitting at the tax office , and said to him , " Fol@@ low me ! "
their scri@@ bes and the Pharis@@ ees mur@@ mu@@ red against his disciples , saying , " Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners ? "
they said to him , " Why do John 's disciples often fast and pray , likewise also the disciples of the Pharis@@ ees , but yours eat and drink ? "
he said to them , " Can you make the friends of the bri@@ deg@@ room fast , while the bri@@ deg@@ room is with them ?
but the days will come when the bri@@ deg@@ room will be taken away from them . then they will fast in those days . "
he also told a parable to them . " no one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment , or else he will tear the new , and also the piece from the new will not match the old .
now it happened on the second Sabbath after the first , that he was going through the grain fields . his disciples pl@@ ucked the heads of grain , and ate , rubbing them in their hands .
but some of the Pharis@@ ees said to them , " Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day ? "
Jesus , answering them , said , " Hav@@ en '@@ t you read what David did when he was hungry , he , and those who were with him ;
how he entered into God 's house , and took and ate the show bread , and gave also to those who were with him , which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone ? "
but he knew their thoughts ; and he said to the man who had the with@@ ered hand , " R@@ ise up , and stand in the middle . " he arose and stood .
then Jesus said to them , " I will ask you something : is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good , or to do harm ? to save a life , or to kill ? "
he lifted up his eyes to his disciples , and said , " Bless@@ ed are you who are poor , for yours is the Kingdom of God .
blessed are you when men shall hate you , and when they shall exclude and mo@@ ck you , and throw out your name as evil , for the Son of Man 's sake .
rejoice in that day , and leap for joy , for behold , your reward is great in heaven , for their fathers did the same thing to the prophets .
w@@ oe to you , you who are full now , for you will be hungry . w@@ oe to you who laugh now , for you will mour@@ n and we@@ ep .
give to everyone who asks you , and don '@@ t ask him who takes away your goods to give them back again .
if you love those who love you , what credit is that to you ? for even sinners love those who love them .
but love your enemies , and do good , and lend , expecting nothing back ; and your reward will be great , and you will be children of the Most High ; for he is kind toward the un@@ thankful and evil .
Don '@@ t judge , and you won '@@ t be judged . Don '@@ t condemn , and you won '@@ t be condemned . set free , and you will be set free .
" give , and it will be given to you : good measure , pressed down , shaken together , and running over , will be given to you . for with the same measure you measure it will be measured back to you . "
he spoke a parable to them . " can the blind guide the blind ? won '@@ t they both fall into a pit ?
for each tree is known by its own fruit . for people don '@@ t gather fi@@ gs from thor@@ ns , nor do they gather grapes from a br@@ am@@ ble bush .
but he who hears , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t do , is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation , against which the stream broke , and immediately it fell , and the ruin of that house was great . "
a certain cent@@ ur@@ ion 's servant , who was dear to him , was sick and at the point of death .
Jesus went with them . when he was now not far from the house , the cent@@ ur@@ ion sent friends to him , saying to him , " Lord , don '@@ t trouble yourself , for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof .
for I also am a man placed under authority , having under myself soldiers . I tell this one , ' Go ! ' and he goes ; and to another , ' Come ! ' and he comes ; and to my servant , ' Do this , ' and he does it . "
when Jesus heard these things , he marv@@ eled at him , and turned and said to the multitude who followed him , " I tell you , I have not found such great faith , no , not in Israel . "
it happened soon afterwards , that he went to a city called N@@ ain . many of his disciples , along with a great multitude , went with him .
now when he drew near to the gate of the city , behold , one who was dead was carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow . many people of the city were with her .
he came near and touched the coffin , and the bearers stood still . he said , " Young man , I tell you , arise ! "
fear took hold of all , and they glori@@ fied God , saying , " A great prophet has arisen among us ! " and , " God has visited his people ! "
John , calling to himself two of his disciples , sent them to Jesus , saying , " Are you the one who is coming , or should we look for another ? "
when the men had come to him , they said , " John the Bap@@ tiz@@ er has sent us to you , saying , ' Are you he who comes , or should we look for another ? ' "
when John 's messengers had departed , he began to tell the multi@@ tudes about John , " What did you go out into the wilderness to see ? a re@@ ed shaken by the wind ?
but what did you go out to see ? a man clo@@ thed in soft clothing ? behold , those who are gor@@ ge@@ ously dressed , and live delic@@ ately , are in kings ' courts .
but what did you go out to see ? a prophet ? yes , I tell you , and much more than a prophet .
this is he of whom it is written , ' Be@@ hold , I send my messenger before your face , who will prepare your way before you . '
the Son of Man has come eating and drinking , and you say , ' Be@@ hold , a glut@@ ton@@ ous man , and a drun@@ k@@ ard ; a friend of tax collectors and sinners ! '
behold , a woman in the city who was a sinner , when she knew that he was re@@ cl@@ ining in the Pharis@@ ee 's house , she brought an al@@ ab@@ aster jar of o@@ int@@ ment .
standing behind at his feet we@@ eping , she began to wet his feet with her tears , and she wiped them with the hair of her head , kis@@ sed his feet , and ano@@ inted them with the o@@ int@@ ment .
now when the Pharis@@ ee who had invited him saw it , he said to himself , " This man , if he were a prophet , would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him , that she is a sinner . "
therefore I tell you , her sins , which are many , are forgiven , for she loved much . but to whom little is forgiven , the same loves little . "
those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves , " Who is this who even for@@ gives sins ? "
" the farmer went out to sow his seed . as he s@@ owed , some fell along the road , and it was tram@@ pled under foot , and the birds of the sky dev@@ oured it .
other seed fell on the rock , and as soon as it grew , it with@@ ered away , because it had no moisture .
that which fell among the thor@@ ns , these are those who have heard , and as they go on their way they are cho@@ ked with cares , riches , and pleasures of life , and bring no fruit to maturity .
be careful therefore how you hear . for whoever has , to him will be given ; and whoever do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have , from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has . "
it was told him by some saying , " Your mother and your brothers stand outside , desi@@ ring to see you . "
they came to him , and aw@@ oke him , saying , " Master , master , we are dying ! " he aw@@ oke , and rebu@@ ked the wind and the raging of the water , and they ceased , and it was calm .
now there was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain , and they beg@@ ged him that he would allow them to enter into those . he allowed them .
the demons came out from the man , and entered into the pigs , and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake , and were drowned .
people went out to see what had happened . they came to Jesus , and found the man from whom the demons had gone out , sitting at Jesus ' feet , clo@@ thed and in his right mind ; and they were afraid .
all the people of the surrounding country of the G@@ ad@@ aren@@ es asked him to depart from them , for they were very much afraid . he entered into the boat , and returned .
it happened , when Jesus returned , that the multitude welcomed him , for they were all waiting for him .
behold , there came a man named J@@ air@@ us , and he was a ruler of the synagogue . he fell down at Jesus ' feet , and beg@@ ged him to come into his house ,
a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years , who had spent all her living on physicians , and could not be healed by any ,
when the woman saw that she was not hidden , she came trembling , and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him , and how she was healed immediately .
he said to her , " Dau@@ ghter , che@@ er up . your faith has made you well . go in peace . "
while he still spoke , one from the ruler of the synagogue 's house came , saying to him , " Your daughter is dead . Don '@@ t trouble the Teacher . "
when he came to the house , he did@@ n '@@ t allow anyone to enter in , except Peter , John , James , the father of the child , and her mother .
but he put them all outside , and taking her by the hand , he called , saying , " Child , arise ! "
now Her@@ od the te@@ tr@@ arch heard of all that was done by him ; and he was very perpl@@ exed , because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead ,
but the multi@@ tudes , percei@@ ving it , followed him . he welcomed them , and spoke to them of the Kingdom of God , and he cured those who needed healing .
but he said to them , " You give them something to eat . " they said , " We have no more than five lo@@ aves and two fish , unless we should go and buy food for all these people . "
for they were about five thousand men . he said to his disciples , " Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each . "
he took the five lo@@ aves and the two fish , and looking up to the sky , he blessed them , and broke them , and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude .
they answered , " ' John the Bap@@ tiz@@ er , ' but others say , ' Elijah , ' and others , that one of the old prophets is risen again . "
he said to them , " But who do you say that I am ? " Peter answered , " The Christ of God . "
saying , " The Son of Man must suffer many things , and be rejected by the elders , chief priests , and scri@@ bes , and be killed , and the third day be raised up . "
for what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world , and loses or forfe@@ its his own self ?
it happened about eight days after these say@@ ings , that he took with him Peter , John , and James , and went up onto the mountain to pray .
now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep , but when they were fully awake , they saw his glory , and the two men who stood with him .
it happened , as they were par@@ ting from him , that Peter said to Jesus , " Master , it is good for us to be here . let 's make three tents : one for you , and one for Moses , and one for Elijah , " not knowing what he said .
it happened on the next day , when they had come down from the mountain , that a great multitude met him .
while he was still coming , the demon threw him down and convul@@ sed him violently . but Jesus rebu@@ ked the un@@ clean spirit , and healed the boy , and gave him back to his father .
they were all astonished at the maj@@ esty of God . but while all were marv@@ eling at all the things which Jesus did , he said to his disciples ,
Jesus , percei@@ ving the reasoning of their hearts , took a little child , and set him by his side ,
when his disciples , James and John , saw this , they said , " Lord , do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky , and destroy them , just as Elijah did ? "
for the Son of Man did@@ n '@@ t come to destroy men 's lives , but to save them . " they went to another village .
Jesus said to him , " The fo@@ xes have holes , and the birds of the sky have ne@@ sts , but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head . "
he said to another , " Fol@@ low me ! " but he said , " Lord , allow me first to go and bury my father . "
but Jesus said to him , " Leave the dead to bury their own dead , but you go and announce the Kingdom of God . "
but Jesus said to him , " No one , having put his hand to the plo@@ w , and looking back , is fit for the Kingdom of God . "
now after these things , the Lord also appointed seventy others , and sent them two by two ahead of him into every city and place , where he was about to come .
heal the sick who are therein , and tell them , ' The Kingdom of God has come near to you . '
'@@ Even the dust from your city that cl@@ ings to us , we wipe off against you . nevertheless know this , that the Kingdom of God has come near to you . '
" w@@ oe to you , Ch@@ or@@ az@@ in ! w@@ oe to you , Beth@@ s@@ aida ! for if the mighty works had been done in Ty@@ re and Sid@@ on which were done in you , they would have rep@@ ented long ago , sitting in s@@ ack@@ cloth and ashes .
whoever list@@ ens to you list@@ ens to me , and whoever rejects you rejects me . whoever rejects me rejects him who sent me . "
behold , I give you authority to t@@ read on ser@@ p@@ ents and scor@@ pi@@ ons , and over all the power of the enemy . nothing will in any way hurt you .
nevertheless , don '@@ t rejoice in this , that the spirits are subject to you , but rejoice that your names are written in heaven . "
turning to the disciples , he said , " All things have been delivered to me by my Father . no one knows who the Son is , except the Father , and who the Father is , except the Son , and he to wh@@ om@@ ever the Son desires to reveal him . "
for I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you see , and did@@ n '@@ t see them , and to hear the things which you hear , and did@@ n '@@ t hear them . "
came to him , and bound up his wounds , pouring on oil and wine . he set him on his own animal , and brought him to an inn , and took care of him .
it happened as they went on their way , he entered into a certain village , and a certain woman named Mar@@ tha received him into her house .
but Mar@@ tha was distracted with much serving , and she came up to him , and said , " Lord , don '@@ t you care that my sister left me to serve alone ? ask her therefore to help me . "
but one thing is needed . Mary has chosen the good part , which will not be taken away from her . "
forgive us our sins , for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us . bring us not into temptation , but deliver us from the evil one . ' "
and he from within will answer and say , ' Don '@@ t bother me . the door is now shut , and my children are with me in bed . I can '@@ t get up and give it to you ' ?
I tell you , although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend , yet because of his persistence , he will get up and give him as many as he needs .
" which of you fathers , if your son asks for bread , will give him a stone ? or if he asks for a fish , he won '@@ t give him a snake instead of a fish , will he ?
if you then , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him ? "
he was casting out a demon , and it was mute . it happened , when the demon had gone out , the mute man spoke ; and the multi@@ tudes marv@@ eled .
but some of them said , " He casts out demons by Be@@ el@@ ze@@ bul , the prince of the demons . "
the un@@ clean spirit , when he has gone out of the man , passes through dry places , seeking rest , and finding none , he says , ' I will turn back to my house from which I came out . '
when the multi@@ tudes were gathering together to him , he began to say , " This is an evil generation . it seeks after a sign . no sign will be given to it but the sign of Jon@@ ah , the prophet .
for even as Jon@@ ah became a sign to the N@@ inev@@ ites , so will also the Son of Man be to this generation .
" no one , when he has lit a lamp , puts it in a cellar or under a basket , but on a stand , that those who come in may see the light .
if therefore your whole body is full of light , having no part dark , it will be wholly full of light , as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light . "
now as he spoke , a certain Pharis@@ ee asked him to dine with him . he went in , and sat at the table .
the Lord said to him , " Now you Pharis@@ ees clean@@ se the outside of the cup and of the plat@@ ter , but your inward part is full of extortion and w@@ ick@@ edness .
but give for gifts to the ne@@ edy those things which are within , and behold , all things will be clean to you .
but w@@ oe to you Pharis@@ ees ! for you ti@@ the min@@ t and ru@@ e and every her@@ b , but you bypass justice and the love of God . you ought to have done these , and not to have left the other un@@ done .
w@@ oe to you Pharis@@ ees ! for you love the best seats in the syn@@ agogues , and the greetings in the market@@ places .
he said , " W@@ oe to you lawyers also ! for you load men with burdens that are difficult to carry , and you yourselves won '@@ t even lift one finger to help carry those burdens .
w@@ oe to you ! for you build the tom@@ bs of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
as he said these things to them , the scri@@ bes and the Pharis@@ ees began to be terribly angry , and to draw many things out of him ;
lying in wait for him , and seeking to catch him in something he might say , that they might accuse him .
therefore whatever you have said in the darkness will be heard in the light . what you have spoken in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed on the hous@@ et@@ ops .
but I will warn you whom you should fear . fear him , who after he has killed , has power to cast into Ge@@ hen@@ na . yes , I tell you , fear him .
but the very ha@@ irs of your head are all numbered . therefore don '@@ t be afraid . you are of more value than many spar@@ rows .
" I tell you , everyone who conf@@ esses me before men , him will the Son of Man also confess before the angels of God ;
when they bring you before the syn@@ agogues , the rulers , and the authorities , don '@@ t be anxious how or what you will answer , or what you will say ;
but he said to him , " Man , who made me a judge or an arbitr@@ ator over you ? "
he spoke a parable to them , saying , " The ground of a certain rich man brought forth ab@@ und@@ antly .
he reasoned within himself , saying , ' What will I do , because I don '@@ t have room to store my crops ? '
he said , ' This is what I will do . I will pull down my bar@@ ns , and build bigger ones , and there I will store all my grain and my goods .
I will tell my soul , " Soul , you have many goods laid up for many years . take your ease , eat , drink , be mer@@ ry . " '
" but God said to him , ' You foolish one , tonight your soul is required of you . the things which you have prep@@ are@@ d@@ -@@ -@@ whose will they be ? '
he said to his disciples , " T@@ herefore I tell you , don '@@ t be anxious for your life , what you will eat , nor yet for your body , what you will wear .
if then you are@@ n '@@ t able to do even the least things , why are you anxious about the rest ?
but if this is how God clothes the grass in the field , which today exists , and tomorrow is cast into the oven , how much more will he clo@@ the you , O you of little faith ?
be like men watching for their lord , when he returns from the marriage feast ; that , when he comes and kno@@ cks , they may immediately open to him .
blessed are those servants , whom the lord will find watching when he comes . most certainly I tell you , that he will dress himself , and make them re@@ cl@@ ine , and will come and serve them .
but know this , that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming , he would have watched , and not allowed his house to be broken into .
the Lord said , " Who then is the faithful and wise ste@@ ward , whom his lord will set over his household , to give them their portion of food at the right times ?
but if that servant says in his heart , ' My lord delays his coming , ' and begins to beat the men@@ servants and the mai@@ d@@ servants , and to eat and drink , and to be drun@@ ken ,
then the lord of that servant will come in a day when he is@@ n '@@ t expecting him , and in an hour that he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know , and will cut him in two , and place his portion with the un@@ faithful .
but he who did@@ n '@@ t know , and did things worthy of stri@@ pes , will be beaten with few stri@@ pes . to wh@@ om@@ ever much is given , of him will much be required ; and to whom much was entrusted , of him more will be asked .
but I have a baptism to be baptized with , and how distressed I am until it is accomplished !
he said to the multi@@ tudes also , " When you see a cloud rising from the west , immediately you say , ' A shower is coming , ' and so it happens .
now there were some present at the same time who told him about the Gal@@ ile@@ ans , whose blood Pil@@ ate had mixed with their sacrifices .
or those eighteen , on whom the tower in Sil@@ o@@ am fell , and killed them ; do you think that they were worse off@@ enders than all the men who dwell in Jerusalem ?
I tell you , no , but , unless you repent , you will all perish in the same way . "
he spoke this parable . " a certain man had a fi@@ g tree planted in his viney@@ ard , and he came seeking fruit on it , and found none .
he said to the vine d@@ res@@ ser , ' Be@@ hold , these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fi@@ g tree , and found none . cut it down . why does it waste the soil ? '
if it bears fruit , fine ; but if not , after that , you can cut it down . ' "
when Jesus saw her , he called her , and said to her , " Woman , you are freed from your in@@ firm@@ ity . "
the ruler of the synagogue , being indig@@ n@@ ant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath , said to the multitude , " There are six days in which men ought to work . therefore come on those days and be healed , and not on the Sabbath day ! "
therefore the Lord answered him , " You hypo@@ crit@@ es ! do@@ es@@ n '@@ t each one of you free his ox or his don@@ key from the stall on the Sabbath , and lead him away to water ?
as he said these things , all his adversaries were disappointed , and all the multitude rejo@@ iced for all the glorious things that were done by him .
it is like a grain of mu@@ st@@ ard seed , which a man took , and put in his own garden . it grew , and became a large tree , and the birds of the sky lodged in its branches . "
then you will begin to say , ' We ate and drank in your presence , and you taught in our streets . '
he will say , ' I tell you , I don '@@ t know where you come from . depart from me , all you workers of ini@@ qu@@ ity . '
there will be we@@ eping and gn@@ ashing of teeth , when you see Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , and all the prophets , in the Kingdom of God , and yourselves being thrown outside .
behold , there are some who are last who will be first , and there are some who are first who will be last . "
on that same day , some Pharis@@ ees came , saying to him , " Get out of here , and go away , for Her@@ od wants to kill you . "
he said to them , " Go and tell that fox , ' Be@@ hold , I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow , and the third day I complete my mission .
" Jerusalem , Jerusalem , that kills the prophets , and stones those who are sent to her ! how often I wanted to gather your children together , like a hen g@@ athers her own bro@@ od under her wings , and you refused !
behold , your house is left to you des@@ ol@@ ate . I tell you , you will not see me , until you say , ' Bless@@ ed is he who comes in the name of the Lord ! ' "
but they were silent . he took him , and healed him , and let him go .
he answered them , " Which of you , if your son or an ox fell into a well , w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day ? "
" when you are invited by anyone to a marriage feast , don '@@ t sit in the best seat , since perhaps someone more honorable than you might be invited by him ,
and he who invited both of you would come and tell you , ' Make room for this person . ' then you would begin , with shame , to take the lowest place .
but when you make a feast , ask the poor , the ma@@ im@@ ed , the lame , or the blind ;
but he said to him , " A certain man made a great sup@@ per , and he invited many people .
he sent out his servant at sup@@ per time to tell those who were invited , ' Come , for everything is ready now . '
they all as one began to make excuses . " the first said to him , ' I have bought a field , and I must go and see it . please have me exc@@ used . '
" another said , ' I have bought five y@@ oke of ox@@ en , and I must go try them out . please have me exc@@ used . '
" that servant came , and told his lord these things . then the master of the house , being angry , said to his servant , ' Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city , and bring in the poor , ma@@ im@@ ed , blind , and lame . '
or perhaps , when he has laid a foundation , and is not able to finish , everyone who sees begins to mo@@ ck him ,
or what king , as he goes to encounter another king in war , will not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand ?
it is fit neither for the soil nor for the man@@ ure pile . it is thrown out . he who has ears to hear , let him hear . "
" which of you men , if you had one hundred sheep , and lost one of them , w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t leave the ninety @@@ -@@ @ nine in the wilderness , and go after the one that was lost , until he found it ?
when he comes home , he calls together his friends and his neighbors , saying to them , ' Re@@ jo@@ ice with me , for I have found my sheep which was lost ! '
or what woman , if she had ten dr@@ ach@@ ma coins , if she lost one dr@@ ach@@ ma coin , w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t light a lamp , sweep the house , and seek dilig@@ ently until she found it ?
even so , I tell you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner rep@@ enting . "
the younger of them said to his father , ' Father , give me my share of your property . ' he divided his livelihood between them .
not many days after , the younger son gathered all of this together and traveled into a far country . there he wasted his property with ri@@ ot@@ ous living .
when he had spent all of it , there arose a severe famine in that country , and he began to be in need .
but when he came to himself he said , ' How many hired servants of my father 's have bread enough to spare , and I 'm dying with hunger !
" he arose , and came to his father . but while he was still far off , his father saw him , and was moved with compassion , and ran , and fell on his neck , and kis@@ sed him .
" but the father said to his servants , ' B@@ ring out the best robe , and put it on him . put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet .
he also said to his disciples , " There was a certain rich man who had a manager . an accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his possessions .
he called him , and said to him , ' What is this that I hear about you ? give an accounting of your management , for you can no longer be manager . '
calling each one of his lord 's debtors to him , he said to the first , ' How much do you owe to my lord ? '
he said , ' A hundred bat@@ os of oil . ' he said to him , ' Take your bill , and sit down quickly and write fifty . '
I tell you , make for yourselves friends by means of un@@ righteous mamm@@ on , so that when you fail , they may receive you into the eternal tents .
if therefore you have not been faithful in the un@@ righteous mamm@@ on , who will commit to your trust the true riches ?
no servant can serve two masters , for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to one , and desp@@ ise the other . you are@@ n '@@ t able to serve God and mamm@@ on . "
he said to them , " You are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men , but God knows your hearts . for that which is exalted among men is an ab@@ om@@ ination in the sight of God .
and desi@@ ring to be fed with the crum@@ bs that fell from the rich man 's table . yes , even the dogs came and lic@@ ked his so@@ res .
he cried and said , ' Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Laz@@ ar@@ us , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue ! for I am in angu@@ ish in this flame . '
" but Abraham said , ' Son , remember that you , in your lifetime , received your good things , and Laz@@ ar@@ us , in the same way , bad things . but now here he is comfor@@ ted and you are in angu@@ ish .
besides all this , between us and you there is a great gul@@ f fixed , that those who want to pass from here to you are not able , and that none may cross over from there to us . '
for I have five brothers , that he may testify to them , so they won '@@ t also come into this place of tor@@ ment . '
" he said to him , ' If they don '@@ t listen to Moses and the prophets , neither will they be persuaded if one rises from the dead . ' "
he said to the disciples , " It is impossible that no occasions of stumbling should come , but w@@ oe to him through whom they come !
it would be better for him if a mil@@ l@@ stone were hung around his neck , and he were thrown into the sea , rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stum@@ ble .
the Lord said , " If you had faith like a grain of mu@@ st@@ ard seed , you would tell this sy@@ cam@@ ore tree , ' Be upro@@ oted , and be planted in the sea , ' and it would obey you .
but who is there among you , having a servant pl@@ owing or keeping sheep , that will say , when he comes in from the field , ' Come immediately and sit down at the table , '
even so you also , when you have done all the things that are commanded you , say , ' We are un@@ worthy servants . we have done our duty . ' "
he fell on his face at Jesus ' feet , giving him thanks ; and he was a Sam@@ ar@@ itan .
being asked by the Pharis@@ ees when the Kingdom of God would come , he answered them , " The Kingdom of God do@@ es@@ n '@@ t come with observation ;
neither will they say , ' Look , here ! ' or , ' Look , there ! ' for behold , the Kingdom of God is within you . "
for as the lightning , when it flashes out of the one part under the sky , shines to the other part under the sky ; so will the Son of Man be in his day .
they ate , they drank , they married , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noah entered into the ship , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
in that day , he who will be on the hous@@ et@@ op , and his goods in the house , let him not go down to take them away . let him who is in the field likewise not turn back .
won '@@ t God av@@ enge his chosen ones , who are crying out to him day and night , and yet he exercises patience with them ?
I tell you that he will av@@ enge them quickly . nevertheless , when the Son of Man comes , will he find faith on the earth ? "
but the tax collector , standing far away , w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t even lift up his eyes to heaven , but beat his breast , saying , ' God , be mer@@ ciful to me , a sinner ! '
I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other ; for everyone who exal@@ ts himself will be hum@@ bled , but he who hum@@ bles himself will be exalted . "
Jesus summoned them , saying , " Allow the little children to come to me , and don '@@ t hinder them , for the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these .
when Jesus heard these things , he said to him , " You still lack one thing . sell all that you have , and distribute it to the poor . you will have treasure in heaven . come , follow me . "
he said to them , " Most certainly I tell you , there is no one who has left house , or wife , or brothers , or parents , or children , for the Kingdom of God 's sake ,
he took the twelve aside , and said to them , " Be@@ hold , we are going up to Jerusalem , and all the things that are written through the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be completed .
there was a man named Z@@ acc@@ ha@@ eus . he was a chief tax collector , and he was rich .
when Jesus came to the place , he looked up and saw him , and said to him , " Z@@ acc@@ ha@@ eus , hurry and come down , for today I must stay at your house . "
when they saw it , they all mur@@ mu@@ red , saying , " He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner . "
Z@@ acc@@ ha@@ eus stood and said to the Lord , " Be@@ hold , Lord , half of my goods I give to the poor . if I have wrong@@ fully exac@@ ted anything of anyone , I restore four times as much . "
as they heard these things , he went on and told a parable , because he was near Jerusalem , and they supposed that the Kingdom of God would be revealed immediately .
but his citizens hated him , and sent an envoy after him , saying , ' We don '@@ t want this man to reign over us . '
" he said to him , ' Well done , you good servant ! because you were found faithful with very little , you shall have authority over ten cities . '
for I feared you , because you are an exac@@ ting man . you take up that which you did@@ n '@@ t lay down , and reap that which you did@@ n '@@ t sow . '
" he said to him , ' Out of your own mouth will I judge you , you wicked servant ! you knew that I am an exac@@ ting man , taking up that which I did@@ n '@@ t lay down , and re@@ aping that which I did@@ n '@@ t sow .
it happened , when he drew near to Beth@@ sp@@ ha@@ ge and Beth@@ any , at the mountain that is called O@@ liv@@ et , he sent two of his disciples ,
saying , " Go your way into the village on the other side , in which , as you enter , you will find a col@@ t tied , where@@ on no man ever yet sat . unti@@ e it , and bring it .
if anyone asks you , ' Why are you un@@ t@@ ying it ? ' say to him : ' the Lord needs it . ' "
as they were un@@ t@@ ying the col@@ t , its owners said to them , " Why are you un@@ t@@ ying the col@@ t ? "
saying , " Bless@@ ed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord ! peace in heaven , and glory in the highest ! "
and will d@@ ash you and your children within you to the ground . they will not leave in you one stone on another , because you did@@ n '@@ t know the time of your vis@@ itation . "
he was teaching daily in the temple , but the chief priests and the scri@@ bes and the leading men among the people sought to destroy him .
they asked him , " Tell us : by what authority do you do these things ? or who is giving you this authority ? "
he began to tell the people this parable . " a man planted a viney@@ ard , and rented it out to some farmers , and went into another country for a long time .
at the proper season , he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the viney@@ ard . but the farmers beat him , and sent him away empty .
" but when the farmers saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , ' This is the heir . come , let 's kill him , that the inheritance may be ours . '
they threw him out of the viney@@ ard , and killed him . what therefore will the lord of the viney@@ ard do to them ?
but he looked at them , and said , " Then what is this that is written , ' The stone which the builders rejected , the same was made the chief cornerstone ? '
they watched him , and sent out spies , who pre@@ tended to be righteous , that they might trap him in something he said , so as to deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor .
they wer@@ en '@@ t able to trap him in his words before the people . they marv@@ eled at his answer , and were silent .
they asked him , " Teacher , Moses wrote to us that if a man 's brother dies having a wife , and he is chil@@ dless , his brother should take the wife , and raise up children for his brother .
for they can '@@ t die any more , for they are like the angels , and are children of God , being children of the resurrection .
now he is not the God of the dead , but of the living , for all are alive to him . "
David himself says in the book of Psal@@ ms , ' The Lord said to my Lord , " S@@ it at my right hand ,
" beware of the scri@@ bes , who like to walk in long robes , and love greetings in the market@@ places , the best seats in the syn@@ agogues , and the best places at fe@@ asts ;
for all these put in gifts for God from their abundance , but she , out of her poverty , put in all that she had to live on . "
they asked him , " Teacher , so when will these things be ? what is the sign that these things are about to happen ? "
he said , " Watch out that you don '@@ t get led astr@@ ay , for many will come in my name , saying , ' I am he , ' and , ' The time is at hand . ' therefore don '@@ t follow them .
when you hear of wars and disturbances , don '@@ t be terrified , for these things must happen first , but the end won '@@ t come immediately . "
but before all these things , they will lay their hands on you and will persec@@ ute you , delivering you up to syn@@ agogues and prisons , bringing you before kings and governors for my name 's sake .
you will be handed over even by parents , brothers , relatives , and friends . they will cause some of you to be put to death .
then let those who are in Ju@@ dea flee to the mountains . let those who are in the midst of her depart . let those who are in the country not enter therein .
w@@ oe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse infants in those days ! for there will be great distress in the land , and wrath to this people .
they will fall by the edge of the sword , and will be led captive into all the nations . Jerusalem will be tram@@ pled down by the Genti@@ les , until the times of the Genti@@ les are fulfilled .
there will be signs in the sun , moon , and stars ; and on the earth anxiety of nations , in perpl@@ ex@@ ity for the ro@@ aring of the sea and the waves ;
but when these things begin to happen , look up , and lift up your heads , because your redemption is near . "
" so be careful , or your hearts will be loaded down with car@@ ousing , drun@@ ken@@ ness , and cares of this life , and that day will come on you suddenly .
the chief priests and the scri@@ bes sought how they might put him to death , for they feared the people .
he sent Peter and John , saying , " Go and prepare the Pas@@ sover for us , that we may eat . "
tell the master of the house , ' The Teacher says to you , " Where is the guest room , where I may eat the Pas@@ sover with my disciples ? " '
for I tell you , I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine , until the Kingdom of God comes . "
he took bread , and when he had given thanks , he broke it , and gave to them , saying , " This is my body which is given for you . do this in memory of me . "
likewise , he took the cup after sup@@ per , saying , " This cup is the new covenant in my blood , which is poured out for you .
the Son of Man indeed goes , as it has been determined , but w@@ oe to that man through whom he is betrayed ! "
that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom . you will sit on thr@@ ones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel . "
then he said to them , " But now , whoever has a pur@@ se , let him take it , and likewise a wallet . whoever has none , let him sell his cloak , and buy a sword .
for I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me : ' he was counted with trans@@ gres@@ sors . ' for that which concerns me has an end . "
they said , " Lord , behold , here are two s@@ words . " he said to them , " That is enough . "
he came out , and went , as his custom was , to the Mount of O@@ lives . his disciples also followed him .
when he was at the place , he said to them , " Pr@@ ay that you don '@@ t enter into temptation . "
when he rose up from his prayer , he came to the disciples , and found them sleeping because of grief ,
when those who were around him saw what was about to happen , they said to him , " Lord , shall we strike with the sword ? "
a certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear .
Jesus said to the chief priests , cap@@ tains of the temple , and elders , who had come against him , " Have you come out as against a rob@@ ber , with s@@ words and clubs ?
when I was with you in the temple daily , you did@@ n '@@ t stretch out your hands against me . but this is your hour , and the power of darkness . "
a certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light , and looking int@@ ently at him , said , " This man also was with him . "
after a little while someone else saw him , and said , " You also are one of them ! " but Peter answered , " Man , I am not ! "
after about one hour passed , another confidently affirmed , saying , " Tru@@ ly this man also was with him , for he is a Gal@@ il@@ ean ! "
but Peter said , " Man , I don '@@ t know what you are talking about ! " immediately , while he was still speaking , a ro@@ o@@ ster crow@@ ed .
they began to accuse him , saying , " We found this man perver@@ ting the nation , forbid@@ ding paying taxes to Caes@@ ar , and saying that he himself is Christ , a king . "
Pil@@ ate asked him , " Are you the King of the Jews ? " he answered him , " So you say . "
now when Her@@ od saw Jesus , he was exceedingly glad , for he had wanted to see him for a long time , because he had heard many things about him . he hoped to see some miracle done by him .
he said to them the third time , " Why ? what evil has this man done ? I have found no capital crime in him . I will therefore ch@@ as@@ tise him and release him . "
but they were urgent with loud voices , asking that he might be cruci@@ fied . their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed .
he released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrec@@ tion and murder , for whom they asked , but he delivered Jesus up to their will .
for if they do these things in the green tree , what will be done in the dry ? "
Jesus said , " Father , forgive them , for they don '@@ t know what they are doing . " dividing his garments among them , they cast lots .
the people stood watching . the rulers with them also s@@ coff@@ ed at him , saying , " He saved others . let him save himself , if this is the Christ of God , his chosen one ! "
an inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek , Latin , and Hebrew : " this IS THE K@@ ING OF THE J@@ E@@ WS . "
one of the criminals who was han@@ ged insul@@ ted him , saying , " If you are the Christ , save yourself and us ! "
Jesus , crying with a loud voice , said , " Father , into your hands I commit my spirit ! " having said this , he breath@@ ed his last .
when the cent@@ ur@@ ion saw what was done , he glori@@ fied God , saying , " Cer@@ tain@@ ly this was a righteous man . "
all the multi@@ tudes that came together to see this , when they saw the things that were done , returned home beating their breasts .
he took it down , and wrapped it in a linen cloth , and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone , where no one had ever been laid .
the women , who had come with him out of Gal@@ ilee , followed after , and saw the tomb , and how his body was laid .
saying that the Son of Man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men , and be cruci@@ fied , and the third day rise again ? "
returned from the tomb , and told all these things to the eleven , and to all the rest .
but Peter got up and ran to the tomb . sto@@ oping and looking in , he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves , and he departed to his home , wondering what had happened .
he said to them , " What things ? " they said to him , " The things concerning Jesus , the Naz@@ aren@@ e , who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people ;
and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death , and cruci@@ fied him .
they urged him , saying , " Stay with us , for it is almost evening , and the day is almost over . " he went in to stay with them .
they related the things that happened along the way , and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread .
but they were terrified and filled with fear , and supposed that they had seen a spirit .
he said to them , " This is what I told you , while I was still with you , that all things which are written in the law of Moses , the prophets , and the p@@ sal@@ ms , concerning me must be fulfilled . "
he said to them , " Th@@ us it is written , and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day ,
behold , I send forth the promise of my Father on you . but wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clo@@ thed with power from on high . "
it happened , while he blessed them , that he withdrew from them , and was carried up into heaven .
the same came as a witness , that he might testify about the light , that all might believe through him .
but as many as received him , to them he gave the right to become God 's children , to those who believe in his name :
who were born not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
the Word became flesh , and lived among us . we saw his glory , such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father , full of grace and truth .
this is John 's testimony , when the Jews sent priests and Lev@@ ites from Jerusalem to ask him , " Who are you ? "
the next day , he saw Jesus coming to him , and said , " Be@@ hold , the Lam@@ b of God , who takes away the sin of the world !
I did@@ n '@@ t know him , but for this reason I came bap@@ tizing in water : that he would be revealed to Israel . "
he said to them , " Come , and see . " they came and saw where he was staying , and they stayed with him that day . it was about the tenth hour .
he brought him to Jesus . Jesus looked at him , and said , " You are Simon the son of Jon@@ ah . you shall be called C@@ ep@@ has " ( which is by interpretation , Peter ) .
on the next day , he was determined to go out into Gal@@ ilee , and he found Philip . Jesus said to him , " Fol@@ low me . "
Philip found N@@ ath@@ an@@ ael , and said to him , " We have found him , of whom Moses in the law , and the prophets , wrote : Jesus of Naz@@ areth , the son of Joseph . "
N@@ ath@@ an@@ ael said to him , " Can any good thing come out of Naz@@ areth ? " Philip said to him , " Come and see . "
N@@ ath@@ an@@ ael said to him , " How do you know me ? " Jesus answered him , " Before Philip called you , when you were under the fi@@ g tree , I saw you . "
N@@ ath@@ an@@ ael answered him , " Rabbi , you are the Son of God ! you are King of Israel ! "
Jesus answered him , " Because I told you , ' I saw you underneath the fi@@ g tree , ' do you believe ? you will see greater things than these ! "
he said to him , " Most certainly , I tell you , here@@ after you will see heaven opened , and the angels of God asc@@ ending and descending on the Son of Man . "
when the ruler of the feast t@@ asted the water now become wine , and did@@ n '@@ t know where it came from ( but the servants who had drawn the water knew ) , the ruler of the feast called the bri@@ deg@@ room ,
and said to him , " Everyone serves the good wine first , and when the guests have drunk freely , then that which is worse . you have kept the good wine until now ! "
he made a whi@@ p of cor@@ ds , and threw all out of the temple , both the sheep and the ox@@ en ; and he poured out the chang@@ ers ' money , and over@@ threw their tables .
the Jews therefore said , " It took forty @@@ -@@ @ six years to build this temple ! will you raise it up in three days ? "
Nic@@ o@@ dem@@ us said to him , " How can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter a second time into his mother 's womb , and be born ? "
the wind blows where it wants to , and you hear its sound , but don '@@ t know where it comes from and where it is going . so is everyone who is born of the Spirit . "
no one has asc@@ ended into heaven , but he who descended out of heaven , the Son of Man , who is in heaven .
as Moses lifted up the ser@@ pent in the wilderness , even so must the Son of Man be lifted up ,
but he who does the truth comes to the light , that his works may be revealed , that they have been done in God . "
after these things , Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Ju@@ dea . he stayed there with them , and baptized .
he who has the bride is the bri@@ deg@@ room ; but the friend of the bri@@ deg@@ room , who stands and hears him , rejo@@ ices greatly because of the bri@@ deg@@ room 's voice . this , my joy , therefore is made full .
he who comes from above is above all . he who is from the earth belongs to the earth , and speaks of the earth . he who comes from heaven is above all .
one who believes in the Son has eternal life , but one who dis@@ obe@@ ys the Son won '@@ t see life , but the wrath of God remains on him . "
so he came to a city of Sam@@ aria , called Sy@@ cha@@ r , near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son , Joseph .
Jacob 's well was there . Jesus therefore , being tired from his journey , sat down by the well . it was about the sixth hour .
a woman of Sam@@ aria came to draw water . Jesus said to her , " Gi@@ ve me a drink . "
Jesus answered her , " If you knew the gift of God , and who it is who says to you , ' Gi@@ ve me a drink , ' you would have asked him , and he would have given you living water . "
the woman said to him , " Sir , you have nothing to draw with , and the well is deep . from where then have you that living water ?
are you greater than our father , Jacob , who gave us the well , and drank of it himself , as did his children , and his livestock ? "
the woman said to him , " Sir , give me this water , so that I don '@@ t get thir@@ sty , neither come all the way here to draw . "
but the hour comes , and now is , when the true worshi@@ ppers will worship the Father in spirit and truth , for the Father seeks such to be his worshi@@ ppers .
Jesus said to her , " I am he , the one who speaks to you . "
at this , his disciples came . they marv@@ eled that he was speaking with a woman ; yet no one said , " What are you looking for ? " or , " Why do you speak with her ? "
so the woman left her water pot , and went away into the city , and said to the people ,
the disciples therefore said one to another , " Has anyone brought him something to eat ? "
he who re@@ aps receives wages , and g@@ athers fruit to eternal life ; that both he who s@@ ows and he who re@@ aps may rejoice together .
from that city many of the Sam@@ ar@@ it@@ ans believed in him because of the word of the woman , who testified , " He told me everything that I did . "
when he heard that Jesus had come out of Ju@@ dea into Gal@@ ilee , he went to him , and beg@@ ged him that he would come down and heal his son , for he was at the point of death .
Jesus therefore said to him , " Un@@ less you see signs and wonders , you will in no way believe . "
Jesus said to him , " Go your way . your son lives . " the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him , and he went his way .
so he inqui@@ red of them the hour when he began to get better . they said therefore to him , " Y@@ ester@@ day at the seventh hour , the fever left him . "
for an angel went down at certain times into the pool , and stirred up the water . whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was made whole of whatever disease he had .
when Jesus saw him lying there , and knew that he had been sick for a long time , he asked him , " Do you want to be made well ? "
immediately , the man was made well , and took up his mat and walked . now it was the Sabbath on that day .
afterward Jesus found him in the temple , and said to him , " Be@@ hold , you are made well . sin no more , so that nothing worse happens to you . "
but Jesus answered them , " My Father is still working , so I am working , too . "
for this cause therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him , because he not only broke the Sabbath , but also called God his own Father , making himself equal with God .
for the Father has affection for the Son , and shows him all things that he himself does . he will show him greater works than these , that you may mar@@ vel .
for as the Father raises the dead and gives them life , even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires .
that all may honor the Son , even as they honor the Father . he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t honor the Son do@@ es@@ n '@@ t honor the Father who sent him .
" most certainly I tell you , he who hears my word , and believes him who sent me , has eternal life , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t come into judgment , but has passed out of death into life .
most certainly , I tell you , the hour comes , and now is , when the dead will hear the Son of God 's voice ; and those who hear will live .
I can of myself do nothing . as I hear , I judge , and my judgment is righteous ; because I don '@@ t seek my own will , but the will of my Father who sent me .
but the testimony which I receive is not from man . however , I say these things that you may be saved .
but the testimony which I have is greater than that of John , for the works which the Father gave me to accomplish , the very works that I do , testify about me , that the Father has sent me .
" you search the Scriptures , because you think that in them you have eternal life ; and these are they which testify about me .
" Don '@@ t think that I will accuse you to the Father . there is one who accuses you , even Moses , on whom you have set your hope .
Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes , and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him , said to Philip , " Where are we to buy bread , that these may eat ? "
" there is a boy here who has five barley lo@@ aves and two fish , but what are these among so many ? "
Jesus said , " Have the people sit down . " now there was much grass in that place . so the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
so they gathered them up , and filled twelve bas@@ kets with broken pieces from the five barley lo@@ aves , which were left over by those who had eaten .
when therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did , they said , " This is truly the prophet who comes into the world . "
Jesus therefore , percei@@ ving that they were about to come and take him by force , to make him king , withdrew again to the mountain by himself .
when therefore they had row@@ ed about twenty @@@ -@@ @ five or thirty stad@@ ia , they saw Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing near to the boat ; and they were afraid .
they were willing therefore to receive him into the boat . immediately the boat was at the land where they were going .
when they found him on the other side of the sea , they asked him , " Rabbi , when did you come here ? "
Don '@@ t work for the food which per@@ ishes , but for the food which remains to eternal life , which the Son of Man will give to you . for God the Father has sealed him . "
they said therefore to him , " What then do you do for a sign , that we may see , and believe you ? what work do you do ?
Jesus therefore said to them , " Most certainly , I tell you , it was@@ n '@@ t Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven , but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven .
for the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven , and gives life to the world . "
Jesus said to them , " I am the bread of life . he who comes to me will not be hungry , and he who believes in me will never be thir@@ sty .
this is the will of the one who sent me , that everyone who sees the Son , and believes in him , should have eternal life ; and I will raise him up at the last day . "
they said , " is@@ n '@@ t this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? how then does he say , ' I have come down out of heaven ? ' "
it is written in the prophets , ' They will all be taught by God . ' therefore everyone who hears from the Father , and has learned , comes to me .
this is the bread which comes down out of heaven , that anyone may eat of it and not die .
the Jews therefore cont@@ ended with one another , saying , " How can this man give us his flesh to eat ? "
therefore many of his disciples , when they heard this , said , " This is a hard saying ! who can listen to it ? "
it is the spirit who gives life . the flesh profits nothing . the words that I speak to you are spirit , and are life .
we have come to believe and know that you are the Christ , the Son of the living God . "
now he spoke of Jud@@ as , the son of Simon Is@@ c@@ ari@@ ot , for it was he who would betray him , being one of the twelve .
his brothers therefore said to him , " De@@ part from here , and go into Ju@@ dea , that your disciples also may see your works which you do .
but when his brothers had gone up to the feast , then he also went up , not publicly , but as it were in secret .
there was much mur@@ m@@ uring among the multi@@ tudes concerning him . some said , " He is a good man . " others said , " Not so , but he leads the multitude astr@@ ay . "
the Jews therefore marv@@ eled , saying , " How does this man know letters , having never been educated ? "
he who speaks from himself seeks his own glory , but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true , and no un@@ righteousness is in him .
if a boy receives circum@@ cision on the Sabbath , that the law of Moses may not be broken , are you angry with me , because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath ?
behold , he speaks openly , and they say nothing to him . can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ ?
Jesus therefore cried out in the temple , teaching and saying , " You both know me , and know where I am from . I have not come of myself , but he who sent me is true , whom you don '@@ t know .
the Pharis@@ ees heard the multitude mur@@ m@@ uring these things concerning him , and the chief priests and the Pharis@@ ees sent officers to arrest him .
then Jesus said , " I will be with you a little while longer , then I go to him who sent me .
now on the last and greatest day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried out , " If anyone is thir@@ sty , let him come to me and drink !
the officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharis@@ ees , and they said to them , " Why did@@ n '@@ t you bring him ? "
now very early in the morning , he came again into the temple , and all the people came to him . he sat down , and taught them .
now in our law , Moses commanded us to stone such . what then do you say about her ? "
but when they continued asking him , he looked up and said to them , " He who is without sin among you , let him throw the first stone at her . "
they , when they heard it , being convicted by their conscience , went out one by one , beginning from the oldest , even to the last . Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was , in the middle .
she said , " No one , Lord . " Jesus said , " N@@ either do I condemn you . go your way . from now on , sin no more . "
again , therefore , Jesus spoke to them , saying , " I am the light of the world . he who follows me will not walk in the darkness , but will have the light of life . "
Jesus answered them , " Even if I testify about myself , my testimony is true , for I know where I came from , and where I am going ; but you don '@@ t know where I came from , or where I am going .
Jesus said therefore again to them , " I am going away , and you will seek me , and you will die in your sins . where I go , you can '@@ t come . "
he said to them , " You are from beneath . I am from above . you are of this world . I am not of this world .
they said therefore to him , " Who are you ? " Jesus said to them , " Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning .
I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you . however he who sent me is true ; and the things which I heard from him , these I say to the world . "
Jesus therefore said to them , " When you have lifted up the Son of Man , then you will know that I am he , and I do nothing of myself , but as my Father taught me , I say these things .
he who sent me is with me . the Father h@@ as@@ n '@@ t left me alone , for I always do the things that are pleasing to him . "
I say the things which I have seen with my Father ; and you also do the things which you have seen with your father . "
they answered him , " Our father is Abraham . " Jesus said to them , " If you were Abraham 's children , you would do the works of Abraham .
but now you seek to kill me , a man who has told you the truth , which I heard from God . Abraham did@@ n '@@ t do this .
you do the works of your father . " they said to him , " We were not born of sexual im@@ morality . we have one Father , God . "
then the Jews said to him , " Now we know that you have a demon . Abraham died , and the prophets ; and you say , ' If a man keeps my word , he will never taste of death . '
are you greater than our father , Abraham , who died ? the prophets died . who do you make yourself out to be ? "
you have not known him , but I know him . if I said , ' I don '@@ t know him , ' I would be like you , a li@@ ar . but I know him , and keep his word .
therefore they took up stones to throw at him , but Jesus was hidden , and went out of the temple , having gone through their midst , and so passed by .
I must work the works of him who sent me , while it is day . the night is coming , when no one can work .
and said to him , " Go , wash in the pool of Sil@@ o@@ am " ( which means " S@@ ent " ) . so he went away , washed , and came back seeing .
he answered , " A man called Jesus made mud , ano@@ inted my eyes , and said to me , ' Go to the pool of Sil@@ o@@ am , and wash . ' so I went away and washed , and I received sight . "
again therefore the Pharis@@ ees also asked him how he received his sight . he said to them , " He put mud on my eyes , I washed , and I see . "
some therefore of the Pharis@@ ees said , " This man is not from God , because he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t keep the Sabbath . " others said , " How can a man who is a sinner do such signs ? " there was division among them .
therefore they asked the blind man again , " What do you say about him , because he opened your eyes ? " he said , " He is a prophet . "
his parents said these things because they feared the Jews ; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ , he would be put out of the synagogue .
so they called the man who was blind a second time , and said to him , " Gi@@ ve glory to God . we know that this man is a sinner . "
he therefore answered , " I don '@@ t know if he is a sinner . one thing I do know : that though I was blind , now I see . "
they said to him again , " What did he do to you ? how did he open your eyes ? "
he answered them , " I told you already , and you did@@ n '@@ t listen . why do you want to hear it again ? you don '@@ t also want to become his disciples , do you ? "
we know that God do@@ es@@ n '@@ t listen to sinners , but if anyone is a wor@@ ship@@ per of God , and does his will , he list@@ ens to him .
Jesus said to him , " You have both seen him , and it is he who speaks with you . "
Jesus said , " I came into this world for judgment , that those who don '@@ t see may see ; and that those who see may become blind . "
the gate@@ keeper opens the gate for him , and the sheep listen to his voice . he calls his own sheep by name , and leads them out .
they will by no means follow a stranger , but will flee from him ; for they don '@@ t know the voice of strangers . "
I am the door . if anyone enters in by me , he will be saved , and will go in and go out , and will find past@@ ure .
he who is a hired hand , and not a shepherd , who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t own the sheep , sees the wolf coming , leaves the sheep , and fle@@ es . the wolf s@@ nat@@ ches the sheep , and sc@@ atters them .
the hired hand fle@@ es because he is a hired hand , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t care for the sheep .
no one takes it away from me , but I lay it down by myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . I received this commandment from my Father . "
the Jews therefore came around him and said to him , " How long will you hold us in suspen@@ se ? if you are the Christ , tell us plainly . "
my Father , who has given them to me , is greater than all . no one is able to s@@ nat@@ ch them out of my Father 's hand .
do you say of him whom the Father sancti@@ fied and sent into the world , ' You bl@@ asph@@ eme , ' because I said , ' I am the Son of God ? '
but if I do them , though you don '@@ t believe me , believe the works ; that you may know and believe that the Father is in me , and I in the Father . "
but when Jesus heard it , he said , " This sickness is not to death , but for the glory of God , that God 's Son may be glori@@ fied by it . "
Jesus answered , " are@@ n '@@ t there twelve hours of daylight ? if a man walks in the day , he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t stum@@ ble , because he sees the light of this world .
but if a man walks in the night , he stum@@ bles , because the light is@@ n '@@ t in him . "
I am glad for your s@@ akes that I was not there , so that you may believe . nevertheless , let 's go to him . "
Mar@@ tha said to him , " I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day . "
Jesus said to her , " I am the resurrection and the life . he who believes in me will still live , even if he dies .
she said to him , " Yes , Lord . I have come to believe that you are the Christ , God 's Son , he who comes into the world . "
therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was , and saw him , she fell down at his feet , saying to him , " Lord , if you would have been here , my brother w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have died . "
when Jesus therefore saw her we@@ eping , and the Jews we@@ eping who came with her , he gro@@ an@@ ed in the spirit , and was troubled ,
and said , " Where have you laid him ? " they told him , " Lord , come and see . "
some of them said , " cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t this man , who opened the eyes of him who was blind , have also kept this man from dying ? "
so they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying . Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , " Father , I thank you that you listened to me .
he who was dead came out , bound hand and foot with wrap@@ p@@ ings , and his face was wrapped around with a cloth . Jesus said to them , " Free him , and let him go . "
the chief priests therefore and the Pharis@@ ees gathered a council , and said , " What are we doing ? for this man does many signs .
if we leave him alone like this , everyone will believe in him , and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation . "
nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people , and that the whole nation not perish . "
now the Pas@@ sover of the Jews was at hand . many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Pas@@ sover , to puri@@ fy themselves .
then six days before the Pas@@ sover , Jesus came to Beth@@ any , where Laz@@ ar@@ us was , who had been dead , whom he raised from the dead .
so they made him a sup@@ per there . Mar@@ tha served , but Laz@@ ar@@ us was one of those who sat at the table with him .
for you always have the poor with you , but you don '@@ t always have me . "
a large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there , and they came , not for Jesus ' sake only , but that they might see Laz@@ ar@@ us also , whom he had raised from the dead .
" Don '@@ t be afraid , daughter of Z@@ ion . behold , your King comes , sitting on a don@@ key 's col@@ t . "
his disciples did@@ n '@@ t understand these things at first , but when Jesus was glori@@ fied , then they remembered that these things were written about him , and that they had done these things to him .
the multitude therefore that was with him when he called Laz@@ ar@@ us out of the tomb , and raised him from the dead , was testi@@ fying about it .
for this cause also the multitude went and met him , because they heard that he had done this sign .
these , therefore , came to Philip , who was from Beth@@ s@@ aida of Gal@@ ilee , and asked him , saying , " Sir , we want to see Jesus . "
" now my soul is troubled . what shall I say ? ' father , save me from this time ? ' but for this cause I came to this time .
the multitude therefore , who stood by and heard it , said that it had thunder@@ ed . others said , " An angel has spoken to him . "
now is the judgment of this world . now the prince of this world will be cast out .
the multitude answered him , " We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever . how do you say , ' The Son of Man must be lifted up ? ' who is this Son of Man ? "
Jesus therefore said to them , " Y@@ et a little while the light is with you . walk while you have the light , that darkness do@@ es@@ n '@@ t over@@ take you . he who walks in the darkness do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know where he is going .
while you have the light , believe in the light , that you may become children of light . " Jesus said these things , and he departed and hid himself from them .
" he has blin@@ ded their eyes and he hardened their heart , lest they should see with their eyes , and perceive with their heart , and would turn , and I would heal them . "
nevertheless even of the rulers many believed in him , but because of the Pharis@@ ees they did@@ n '@@ t confess it , so that they w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t be put out of the synagogue ,
I have come as a light into the world , that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness .
if anyone list@@ ens to my say@@ ings , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t believe , I don '@@ t judge him . for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
he who rejects me , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t receive my say@@ ings , has one who judges him . the word that I spoke , the same will judge him in the last day .
for I spoke not from myself , but the Father who sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
I know that his commandment is eternal life . the things therefore which I speak , even as the Father has said to me , so I speak . "
now before the feast of the Pas@@ sover , Jesus , knowing that his time had come that he would depart from this world to the Father , having loved his own who were in the world , he loved them to the end .
during sup@@ per , the devil having already put into the heart of Jud@@ as Is@@ c@@ ari@@ ot , Simon 's son , to betray him ,
arose from sup@@ per , and laid aside his outer garments . he took a towel , and wrapped a towel around his waist .
Peter said to him , " You will never wash my feet ! " Jesus answered him , " If I don '@@ t wash you , you have no part with me . "
Jesus said to him , " Some@@ one who has bath@@ ed only needs to have his feet washed , but is completely clean . you are clean , but not all of you . "
for he knew him who would betray him , therefore he said , " You are not all clean . "
so when he had washed their feet , put his outer garment back on , and sat down again , he said to them , " Do you know what I have done to you ?
you call me , ' Teacher ' and ' Lord . ' you say so correctly , for so I am .
most certainly I tell you , a servant is not greater than his lord , neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him .
most certainly I tell you , he who receives wh@@ om@@ ever I send , receives me ; and he who receives me , receives him who sent me . "
Simon Peter therefore bec@@ k@@ oned to him , and said to him , " Tell us who it is of whom he speaks . "
after the piece of bread , then Satan entered into him . then Jesus said to him , " What you do , do quickly . "
for some thought , because Jud@@ as had the money box , that Jesus said to him , " Buy what things we need for the feast , " or that he should give something to the poor .
when he had gone out , Jesus said , " Now the Son of Man has been glori@@ fied , and God has been glori@@ fied in him .
a new commandment I give to you , that you love one another , just like I have loved you ; that you also love one another .
Jesus answered him , " Will you lay down your life for me ? most certainly I tell you , the ro@@ o@@ ster won '@@ t c@@ row until you have denied me three times .
in my Father 's house are many homes . if it wer@@ en '@@ t so , I would have told you . I am going to prepare a place for you .
if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and will receive you to myself ; that where I am , you may be there also .
Jesus said to him , " I am the way , the truth , and the life . no one comes to the Father , except through me .
if you had known me , you would have known my Father also . from now on , you know him , and have seen him . "
Philip said to him , " Lord , show us the Father , and that will be enough for us . "
Jesus said to him , " Have I been with you such a long time , and do you not know me , Philip ? he who has seen me has seen the Father . how do you say , ' Show us the Father ? '
Don '@@ t you believe that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? the words that I tell you , I speak not from myself ; but the Father who lives in me does his works .
most certainly I tell you , he who believes in me , the works that I do , he will do also ; and he will do greater works than these , because I am going to my Father .
I will pray to the Father , and he will give you another Coun@@ sel@@ or , that he may be with you forever , --
the Spirit of truth , whom the world can '@@ t receive ; for it do@@ es@@ n '@@ t see him , neither knows him . you know him , for he lives with you , and will be in you .
one who has my commandments , and keeps them , that person is one who loves me . one who loves me will be loved by my Father , and I will love him , and will reveal myself to him . "
Jud@@ as ( not Is@@ c@@ ari@@ ot ) said to him , " Lord , what has happened that you are about to reveal yourself to us , and not to the world ? "
he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t love me do@@ es@@ n '@@ t keep my words . the word which you hear is@@ n '@@ t mine , but the Father 's who sent me .
but the Coun@@ sel@@ or , the Holy Spirit , whom the Father will send in my name , he will teach you all things , and will remind you of all that I said to you .
peace I leave with you . my peace I give to you ; not as the world gives , give I to you . Don '@@ t let your heart be troubled , neither let it be fearful .
but that the world may know that I love the Father , and as the Father commanded me , even so I do . arise , let us go from here .
if a man do@@ es@@ n '@@ t remain in me , he is thrown out as a branch , and is with@@ ered ; and they gather them , throw them into the fire , and they are burned .
" in this is my Father glori@@ fied , that you bear much fruit ; and so you will be my disciples .
if you keep my commandments , you will remain in my love ; even as I have kept my Father 's commandments , and remain in his love .
I have spoken these things to you , that my joy may remain in you , and that your joy may be made full .
no longer do I call you servants , for the servant do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know what his lord does . but I have called you friends , for everything that I heard from my Father , I have made known to you .
you did@@ n '@@ t choose me , but I chose you , and appointed you , that you should go and bear fruit , and that your fruit should remain ; that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name , he may give it to you .
if you were of the world , the world would love its own . but because you are not of the world , since I chose you out of the world , therefore the world h@@ ates you .
remember the word that I said to you : ' a servant is not greater than his lord . ' if they persecuted me , they will also persec@@ ute you . if they kept my word , they will keep yours also .
" when the Coun@@ sel@@ or has come , whom I will send to you from the Father , the Spirit of truth , who proceeds from the Father , he will testify about me .
but I have told you these things , so that when the time comes , you may remember that I told you about them . I did@@ n '@@ t tell you these things from the beginning , because I was with you .
but now I am going to him who sent me , and none of you asks me , ' Where are you going ? '
nevertheless I tell you the truth : it is to your advantage that I go away , for if I don '@@ t go away , the Coun@@ sel@@ or won '@@ t come to you . but if I go , I will send him to you .
however when he , the Spirit of truth , has come , he will guide you into all truth , for he will not speak from himself ; but whatever he hears , he will speak . he will declare to you things that are coming .
most certainly I tell you , that you will we@@ ep and lam@@ ent , but the world will rejoice . you will be sor@@ row@@ ful , but your sorrow will be turned into joy .
a woman , when she gives birth , has sorrow , because her time has come . but when she has delivered the child , she do@@ es@@ n '@@ t remember the angu@@ ish any more , for the joy that a human being is born into the world .
" in that day you will ask me no questions . most certainly I tell you , whatever you may ask of the Father in my name , he will give it to you .
until now , you have asked nothing in my name . ask , and you will receive , that your joy may be made full .
in that day you will ask in my name ; and I don '@@ t say to you , that I will pray to the Father for you ,
behold , the time is coming , yes , and has now come , that you will be scattered , everyone to his own place , and you will leave me alone . yet I am not alone , because the Father is with me .
I have told you these things , that in me you may have peace . in the world you have oppression ; but che@@ er up ! I have overcome the world . "
Jesus said these things , and lifting up his eyes to heaven , he said , " Father , the time has come . glori@@ fy your Son , that your Son may also glori@@ fy you ;
I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world . they were yours , and you have given them to me . they have kept your word .
I am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I am coming to you . Holy Father , keep them through your name which you have given me , that they may be one , even as we are .
but now I come to you , and I say these things in the world , that they may have my joy made full in themselves .
I pray not that you would take them from the world , but that you would keep them from the evil one .
the glory which you have given me , I have given to them ; that they may be one , even as we are one ;
I in them , and you in me , that they may be perf@@ ected into one ; that the world may know that you sent me , and loved them , even as you loved me .
I made known to them your name , and will make it known ; that the love with which you loved me may be in them , and I in them . "
when Jesus had spoken these words , he went out with his disciples over the bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron , where there was a garden , into which he and his disciples entered .
Jud@@ as then , having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the Pharis@@ ees , came there with lan@@ ter@@ ns , tor@@ ches , and weapons .
they answered him , " Jesus of Naz@@ areth . " Jesus said to them , " I am he . " Jud@@ as also , who betrayed him , was standing with them .
Simon Peter therefore , having a sword , drew it , and struck the high priest 's servant , and cut off his right ear . the servant 's name was Mal@@ ch@@ us .
Jesus therefore said to Peter , " P@@ ut the sword into its she@@ ath . the cup which the Father has given me , shall I not surely drink it ? "
Simon Peter followed Jesus , as did another disciple . now that disciple was known to the high priest , and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest ;
but Peter was standing at the door outside . so the other disciple , who was known to the high priest , went out and spoke to her who kept the door , and brought in Peter .
now the servants and the officers were standing there , having made a fire of co@@ als , for it was cold . they were warming themselves . Peter was with them , standing and warming himself .
Jesus answered him , " I spoke openly to the world . I always taught in syn@@ agogues , and in the temple , where the Jews always meet . I said nothing in secret .
why do you ask me ? ask those who have heard me what I said to them . behold , these know the things which I said . "
when he had said this , one of the officers standing by sl@@ apped Jesus with his hand , saying , " Do you answer the high priest like that ? "
one of the servants of the high priest , being a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off , said , " did@@ n '@@ t I see you in the garden with him ? "
they led Jesus therefore from C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has into the Pra@@ et@@ orium . it was early , and they themselves did@@ n '@@ t enter into the Pra@@ et@@ orium , that they might not be de@@ filed , but might eat the Pas@@ sover .
Pil@@ ate therefore went out to them , and said , " What accusation do you bring against this man ? "
that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled , which he spoke , signi@@ fying by what kind of death he should die .
Pil@@ ate therefore entered again into the Pra@@ et@@ orium , called Jesus , and said to him , " Are you the King of the Jews ? "
Pil@@ ate therefore said to him , " Are you a king then ? " Jesus answered , " You say that I am a king . for this reason I have been born , and for this reason I have come into the world , that I should testify to the truth . everyone who is of the truth list@@ ens to my voice . "
Pil@@ ate said to him , " What is truth ? " when he had said this , he went out again to the Jews , and said to them , " I find no basis for a charge against him .
but you have a custom , that I should release someone to you at the Pas@@ sover . therefore do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews ? "
then Pil@@ ate went out again , and said to them , " Be@@ hold , I bring him out to you , that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him . "
Jesus therefore came out , wearing the crown of thor@@ ns and the purple garment . Pil@@ ate said to them , " Be@@ hold , the man ! "
when therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him , they shouted , saying , " Cru@@ ci@@ fy ! cruci@@ fy ! " Pil@@ ate said to them , " Take him yourselves , and cruci@@ fy him , for I find no basis for a charge against him . "
the Jews answered him , " We have a law , and by our law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God . "
he entered into the Pra@@ et@@ orium again , and said to Jesus , " Where are you from ? " but Jesus gave him no answer .
Pil@@ ate therefore said to him , " are@@ n '@@ t you speaking to me ? Don '@@ t you know that I have power to release you , and have power to cruci@@ fy you ? "
at this , Pil@@ ate was seeking to release him , but the Jews cried out , saying , " If you release this man , you are@@ n '@@ t Caes@@ ar 's friend ! everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caes@@ ar ! "
when Pil@@ ate therefore heard these words , he brought Jesus out , and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called " The pav@@ ement , " but in Hebrew , " Gab@@ bath@@ a . "
they cried out , " A@@ way with him ! away with him ! cruci@@ fy him ! " Pil@@ ate said to them , " Sh@@ all I cruci@@ fy your King ? " the chief priests answered , " We have no king but Caes@@ ar ! "
Pil@@ ate wrote a title also , and put it on the cross . there was written , " J@@ ES@@ US OF Naz@@ areth , THE K@@ ING OF THE J@@ E@@ WS . "
therefore when Jesus saw his mother , and the disciple whom he loved standing there , he said to his mother , " Woman , behold your son ! "
then he said to the disciple , " Be@@ hold , your mother ! " from that hour , the disciple took her to his own home .
after this , Jesus , seeing that all things were now finished , that the Scripture might be fulfilled , said , " I am thir@@ sty . "
now a vessel full of vin@@ eg@@ ar was set there ; so they put a spon@@ ge full of the vin@@ eg@@ ar on h@@ ys@@ so@@ p , and held it at his mouth .
he who has seen has testified , and his testimony is true . he knows that he tells the truth , that you may believe .
after these things , Joseph of Ari@@ ma@@ th@@ a@@ ea , being a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews , asked of Pil@@ ate that he might take away Jesus ' body . Pil@@ ate gave him permission . he came therefore and took away his body .
now on the first day of the week , Mary Mag@@ dal@@ ene went early , while it was still dark , to the tomb , and saw the stone taken away from the tomb .
but Mary was standing outside at the tomb we@@ eping . so , as she we@@ pt , she sto@@ op@@ ed and looked into the tomb ,
they told her , " Woman , why are you we@@ eping ? " she said to them , " Because they have taken away my Lord , and I don '@@ t know where they have laid him . "
Jesus said to her , " Woman , why are you we@@ eping ? who are you looking for ? " she , sup@@ posing him to be the gar@@ den@@ er , said to him , " Sir , if you have carried him away , tell me where you have laid him , and I will take him away . "
when he had said this , he showed them his hands and his side . the disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord .
Jesus therefore said to them again , " Peace be to you . as the Father has sent me , even so I send you . "
after eight days again his disciples were inside , and Thomas was with them . Jesus came , the doors being locked , and stood in the midst , and said , " Peace be to you . "
then he said to Thomas , " R@@ each here your finger , and see my hands . reach here your hand , and put it into my side . Don '@@ t be un@@ believing , but believing . "
Simon Peter said to them , " I 'm going fishing . " they told him , " We are also coming with you . " they immediately went out , and entered into the boat . that night , they caught nothing .
but the other disciples came in the little boat ( for they were not far from the land , but about two hundred cub@@ its away ) , dragging the net full of fish .
Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land , full of great fish , one hundred fifty @@@ -@@ @ three ; and even though there were so many , the net was@@ n '@@ t torn .
Jesus said to them , " Come and eat breakfast . " none of the disciples dared inqu@@ ire of him , " Who are you ? " knowing that it was the Lord .
this is now the third time that Jesus was revealed to his disciples , after he had risen from the dead .
now he said this , signi@@ fying by what kind of death he would glori@@ fy God . when he had said this , he said to him , " Fol@@ low me . "
then Peter , turning around , saw a disciple following . this was the disciple whom Jesus sincerely loved , the one who had also leaned on Jesus ' breast at the sup@@ per and asked , " Lord , who is going to betray You ? "
this saying therefore went out among the brothers , that this disciple w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t die . yet Jesus did@@ n '@@ t say to him that he w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t die , but , " If I desire that he stay until I come , what is that to you ? "
there are also many other things which Jesus did , which if they would all be written , I suppose that even the world itself w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have room for the books that would be written .
until the day in which he was received up , after he had given commandment through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen .
he said to them , " It is@@ n '@@ t for you to know times or seasons which the Father has set within his own authority .
but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you . you will be witnesses to me in Jerusalem , in all Ju@@ dea and Sam@@ aria , and to the utter@@ most parts of the earth . "
who also said , " You men of Gal@@ ilee , why do you stand looking into the sky ? this Jesus , who was received up from you into the sky will come back in the same way as you saw him going into the sky . "
when they had come in , they went up into the upper room , where they were staying ; that is Peter , John , James , Andrew , Philip , Thomas , Bar@@ th@@ ol@@ om@@ ew , Matthew , James the son of Al@@ p@@ ha@@ eus , Simon the Zeal@@ ot , and Jud@@ as the son of James .
all these with one accord continued stead@@ fast@@ ly in prayer and suppl@@ ication , along with the women , and Mary the mother of Jesus , and with his brothers .
now this man obtained a field with the reward for his w@@ ick@@ edness , and falling head@@ long , his body burst open , and all his intest@@ ines g@@ ushed out .
it became known to everyone who lived in Jerusalem that in their language that field was called ' Ak@@ el@@ dam@@ a , ' that is , ' The field of blood . '
beginning from the baptism of John , to the day that he was received up from us , of these one must become a witness with us of his resurrection . "
they prayed , and said , " You , Lord , who know the hearts of all men , show which one of these two you have chosen
to take part in this ministry and apost@@ les@@ hip from which Jud@@ as fell away , that he might go to his own place . "
they were all filled with the Holy Spirit , and began to speak with other languages , as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak .
they were all amazed , and were perpl@@ exed , saying one to another , " What does this mean ? "
but Peter , standing up with the eleven , lifted up his voice , and spoke out to them , " You men of Ju@@ dea , and all you who dwell at Jerusalem , let this be known to you , and listen to my words .
for these are@@ n '@@ t drun@@ ken , as you suppose , seeing it is only the third hour of the day .
yes , and on my servants and on my hand@@ mai@@ dens in those days , I will pour out my Spirit , and they will proph@@ esy .
I will show wonders in the sky above , and signs on the earth beneath ; blood , and fire , and bil@@ lows of smoke .
" men of Israel , hear these words ! Jesus of Naz@@ areth , a man approved by God to you by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you , even as you yourselves know ,
him , being delivered up by the determined counsel and fore@@ knowledge of God , you have taken by the hand of law@@ less men , cruci@@ fied and killed ;
for David says concerning him , ' I saw the Lord always before my face , For he is on my right hand , that I should not be moved .
because you will not leave my soul in H@@ ades , neither will you allow your Holy One to see decay .
being therefore exalted by the right hand of God , and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit , he has poured out this , which you now see and hear .
" let all the house of Israel therefore know certainly that God has made him both Lord and Christ , this Jesus whom you cruci@@ fied . "
Peter said to them , " Rep@@ ent , and be baptized , every one of you , in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins , and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit .
day by day , continuing stead@@ fast@@ ly with one accord in the temple , and breaking bread at home , they took their food with gl@@ ad@@ ness and sing@@ l@@ eness of heart ,
pra@@ ising God , and having favor with all the people . the Lord added to the assembly day by day those who were being saved .
a certain man who was lame from his mother 's womb was being carried , whom they laid daily at the door of the temple which is called Be@@ auti@@ ful , to ask gifts for the ne@@ edy of those who entered into the temple .
but Peter said , " Silver and gold have I none , but what I have , that I give you . in the name of Jesus Christ of Naz@@ areth , get up and walk ! "
they recognized him , that it was he who used to sit begging for gifts for the ne@@ edy at the Be@@ auti@@ ful Gate of the temple . they were filled with wonder and amaz@@ ement at what had happened to him .
as the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John , all the people ran together to them in the por@@ ch that is called Solomon 's , greatly wondering .
the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , the God of our fathers , has glori@@ fied his Serv@@ ant Jesus , whom you delivered up , and denied in the presence of Pil@@ ate , when he had determined to release him .
by faith in his name , his name has made this man strong , whom you see and know . yes , the faith which is through him has given him this perfect sound@@ ness in the presence of you all .
for Moses indeed said to the fathers , ' The Lord God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers , like me . you shall listen to him in all things whatever he says to you .
it will be , that every soul that will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people . '
yes , and all the prophets from Samuel and those who followed after , as many as have spoken , they also told of these days .
God , having raised up his servant , Jesus , sent him to you first , to bless you , in turning away everyone of you from your w@@ ick@@ edness . "
but many of those who heard the word believed , and the number of the men came to be about five thousand .
it happened in the morning , that their rulers , elders , and scri@@ bes were gathered together in Jerusalem .
be it known to you all , and to all the people of Israel , that in the name of Jesus Christ of Naz@@ areth , whom you cruci@@ fied , whom God raised from the dead , in him does this man stand here before you whole .
he is ' the stone which was regarded as worthless by you , the builders , which has become the head of the corner . '
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves ,
saying , " What shall we do to these men ? because indeed a notable miracle has been done through them , as can be plainly seen by all who dwell in Jerusalem , and we can '@@ t deny it .
but so that this spreads no further among the people , let 's threaten them , that from now on they don '@@ t speak to anyone in this name . "
but Peter and John answered them , " Whe@@ ther it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God , judge for yourselves ,
when they had further threatened them , they let them go , finding no way to punish them , because of the people ; for everyone glori@@ fied God for that which was done .
" for truly , in this city against your holy servant , Jesus , whom you ano@@ inted , both Her@@ od and Pon@@ ti@@ us Pil@@ ate , with the Genti@@ les and the people of Israel , were gathered together
while you stretch out your hand to heal ; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy Serv@@ ant Jesus . "
when they had prayed , the place was shaken where they were gathered together . they were all filled with the Holy Spirit , and they spoke the word of God with bold@@ ness .
the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul . not one of them claimed that anything of the things which he possessed was his own , but they had all things in common .
and laid them at the apostles ' feet , and distribution was made to each , according as anyone had need .
but Peter said , " An@@ ani@@ as , why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit , and to keep back part of the price of the land ?
Peter answered her , " Tell me whether you sold the land for so much . " she said , " Yes , for so much . "
she fell down immediately at his feet , and died . the young men came in and found her dead , and they carried her out and buried her by her husband .
multi@@ tudes also came together from the cities around Jerusalem , bringing sick people , and those who were tor@@ m@@ ented by un@@ clean spirits : and they were all healed .
but an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors by night , and brought them out , and said ,
saying , " did@@ n '@@ t we strictly command you not to teach in this name ? behold , you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching , and intend to bring this man 's blood on us . "
God exalted him with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior , to give repentance to Israel , and rem@@ is@@ sion of sins .
after this man , Jud@@ as of Gal@@ ilee rose up in the days of the enrollment , and drew away some people after him . he also perished , and all , as many as obeyed him , were scattered abroad .
but if it is of God , you will not be able to overthrow it , and you would be found even to be fighting against God ! "
they agreed with him . summon@@ ing the apostles , they beat them and commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus , and let them go .
they therefore departed from the presence of the council , rejo@@ icing that they were counted worthy to suffer dis@@ honor for Jesus ' name .
now in those days , when the number of the disciples was multipl@@ ying , a complaint arose from the Hell@@ en@@ ists against the He@@ bre@@ ws , because their wid@@ ows were neglected in the daily service .
the twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said , " It is not appropriate for us to for@@ sake the word of God and serve tables .
therefore select from among you , brothers , seven men of good report , full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom , whom we may appoint over this business .
the word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly . a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith .
for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Naz@@ areth will destroy this place , and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us . "
he said , " Brothers and fathers , listen . the God of glory appeared to our father Abraham , when he was in Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , before he lived in Har@@ an ,
then he came out of the land of the Chal@@ da@@ e@@ ans , and lived in Har@@ an . from there , when his father was dead , God moved him into this land , where you are now living .
God spoke in this way : that his seed would live as aliens in a strange land , and that they would be enslav@@ ed and mist@@ re@@ ated for four hundred years .
he gave him the covenant of circum@@ cision . so Abraham became the father of Isaac , and circum@@ c@@ ised him the eighth day . Isaac became the father of Jacob , and Jacob became the father of the twelve patri@@ archs .
and they were brought back to Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver from the children of Ham@@ or of Sh@@ ec@@ hem .
the same took advantage of our race , and mist@@ re@@ ated our fathers , and forced them to throw out their babies , so that they w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t stay alive .
" the day following , he appeared to them as they fought , and urged them to be at peace again , saying , ' S@@ irs , you are brothers . why do you wrong one another ? '
but he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away , saying , ' Who made you a ruler and a judge over us ?
Moses fled at this saying , and became a stranger in the land of Mi@@ dian , where he became the father of two sons .
'@@ i am the God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . ' Moses trem@@ bled , and dared not look .
I have surely seen the afflic@@ tion of my people that is in Egypt , and have heard their gro@@ aning . I have come down to deliver them . now come , I will send you into Egypt . '
" this Moses , whom they refused , saying , ' Who made you a ruler and a judge ? ' -@@ -@@ God has sent him as both a ruler and a deliver@@ er by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush .
this is that Moses , who said to the children of Israel , ' The Lord our God will raise up a prophet for you from among your brothers , like me . '
saying to Aaron , ' Make us gods that will go before us , for as for this Moses , who led us out of the land of Egypt , we don '@@ t know what has become of him . '
they made a cal@@ f in those days , and brought a sacrifice to the idol , and rejo@@ iced in the works of their hands .
but God turned , and gave them up to serve the army of the sky , as it is written in the book of the prophets , ' Did you offer to me sl@@ ain animals and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness , O house of Israel ?
who found favor in the sight of God , and asked to find a hab@@ itation for the God of Jacob .
'@@ heaven is my throne , and the earth a foot@@ stool for my feet . what kind of house will you build me ? ' says the Lord ; ' or what is the place of my rest ?
which of the prophets did@@ n '@@ t your fathers persec@@ ute ? they killed those who fore@@ told the coming of the Ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous One , of whom you have now become betr@@ ay@@ ers and murderers .
but he , being full of the Holy Spirit , looked up stead@@ fast@@ ly into heaven , and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing on the right hand of God ,
Saul was con@@ sent@@ ing to his death . a great persecution arose against the assembly which was in Jerusalem in that day . they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Ju@@ dea and Sam@@ aria , except for the apostles .
the multi@@ tudes listened with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philip , when they heard and saw the signs which he did .
but there was a certain man , Simon by name , who used to practice sor@@ cery in the city , and amazed the people of Sam@@ aria , making himself out to be some great one ,
but when they believed Philip preaching good news concerning the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ , they were baptized , both men and women .
now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Sam@@ aria had received the word of God , they sent Peter and John to them ,
who , when they had come down , prayed for them , that they might receive the Holy Spirit ;
now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles ' hands , he offered them money ,
they therefore , when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord , returned to Jerusalem , and preached the Good News to many villages of the Sam@@ ar@@ it@@ ans .
but an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip , saying , " A@@ rise , and go toward the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza . this is a desert . "
he arose and went ; and behold , there was a man of Ethiopia , a e@@ un@@ uch of great authority under C@@ and@@ ace , queen of the Ethiop@@ ians , who was over all her treasure , who had come to Jerusalem to worship .
Philip ran to him , and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet , and said , " Do you understand what you are reading ? "
in his humiliation , his judgment was taken away . who will declare His generation ? for his life is taken from the earth . "
he commanded the ch@@ ari@@ ot to stand still , and they both went down into the water , both Philip and the e@@ un@@ uch , and he baptized him .
but Philip was found at Az@@ ot@@ us . passing through , he preached the Good News to all the cities , until he came to Caes@@ area .
but Saul , still breathing threats and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord , went to the high priest ,
and asked for letters from him to the syn@@ agogues of Damascus , that if he found any who were of the Way , whether men or women , he might bring them bound to Jerusalem .
as he traveled , it happened that he got close to Damascus , and suddenly a light from the sky shone around him .
he fell on the earth , and heard a voice saying to him , " Saul , Saul , why do you persec@@ ute me ? "
Saul arose from the ground , and when his eyes were opened , he saw no one . they led him by the hand , and brought him into Damascus .
now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named An@@ ani@@ as . the Lord said to him in a vision , " An@@ ani@@ as ! " he said , " Be@@ hold , it 's me , Lord . "
the Lord said to him , " A@@ rise , and go to the street which is called Str@@ ai@@ ght , and inqu@@ ire in the house of Jud@@ ah for one named Saul , a man of Tar@@ sus . for behold , he is praying ,
and in a vision he has seen a man named An@@ ani@@ as coming in , and laying his hands on him , that he might receive his sight . "
but the Lord said to him , " Go your way , for he is my chosen vessel to bear my name before the nations and kings , and the children of Israel .
An@@ ani@@ as departed , and entered into the house . laying his hands on him , he said , " Brother Saul , the Lord , who appeared to you on the road by which you came , has sent me , that you may receive your sight , and be filled with the Holy Spirit . "
when Saul had come to Jerusalem , he tried to join himself to the disciples ; but they were all afraid of him , not believing that he was a disciple .
but Bar@@ nab@@ as took him , and brought him to the apostles , and declared to them how he had seen the Lord in the way , and that he had spoken to him , and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus .
when the brothers knew it , they brought him down to Caes@@ area , and sent him off to Tar@@ sus .
so the assemblies throughout all Ju@@ dea and Gal@@ ilee and Sam@@ aria had peace , and were built up . they were multiplied , walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit .
it happened , as Peter went throughout all those parts , he came down also to the saints who lived at Ly@@ d@@ da .
now there was at J@@ op@@ pa a certain disciple named Tab@@ i@@ tha , which when translated , means dor@@ c@@ as . this woman was full of good works and acts of mercy which she did .
Peter put them all out , and kne@@ eled down and prayed . turning to the body , he said , " Tab@@ i@@ tha , get up ! " she opened her eyes , and when she saw Peter , she sat up .
at about the ninth hour of the day , he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God coming to him , and saying to him , " Corn@@ eli@@ us ! "
he , fast@@ ening his eyes on him , and being frightened , said , " What is it , Lord ? " he said to him , " Your prayers and your gifts to the ne@@ edy have gone up for a memorial before God .
he lo@@ dges with one Simon , a tan@@ ner , whose house is by the seaside . "
now on the next day as they were on their journey , and got close to the city , Peter went up on the hous@@ et@@ op to pray at about noon .
now while Peter was very perpl@@ exed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean , behold , the men who were sent by Corn@@ eli@@ us , having made inquiry for Simon 's house , stood before the gate ,
on the next day they entered into Caes@@ area . Corn@@ eli@@ us was waiting for them , having called together his relatives and his near friends .
when it happened that Peter entered , Corn@@ eli@@ us met him , fell down at his feet , and worshi@@ ped him .
Corn@@ eli@@ us said , " Four days ago , I was fasting until this hour , and at the ninth hour , I prayed in my house , and behold , a man stood before me in bright clothing ,
therefore I sent to you at once , and it was good of you to come . now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God to hear all things that have been commanded you by God . "
the word which he sent to the children of Israel , preaching good news of peace by Jesus Christ@@ -@@ -@@ he is Lord of all@@ --
you yourselves know what happened , which was proclaimed throughout all Ju@@ dea , beginning from Gal@@ ilee , after the baptism which John preached ;
even Jesus of Naz@@ areth , how God ano@@ inted him with the Holy Spirit and with power , who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil , for God was with him .
not to all the people , but to witnesses who were chosen before by God , to us , who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead .
he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that this is he who is appointed by God as the Judge of the living and the dead .
all the prophets testify about him , that through his name everyone who believes in him will receive rem@@ is@@ sion of sins . "
now the apostles and the brothers who were in Ju@@ dea heard that the Genti@@ les had also received the word of God .
" I was in the city of J@@ op@@ pa praying , and in a trance I saw a vision : a certain container descending , like it was a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners . it came as far as me .
but a voice answered me the second time out of heaven , ' What God has cleans@@ ed , don '@@ t you call un@@ clean . '
I remembered the word of the Lord , how he said , ' John indeed baptized in water , but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit . '
they therefore who were scattered abroad by the oppression that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoen@@ icia , Cyprus , and Anti@@ o@@ ch , speaking the word to no one except to Jews only .
but there were some of them , men of Cyprus and Cy@@ rene , who , when they had come to Anti@@ o@@ ch , spoke to the Hell@@ en@@ ists , preaching the Lord Jesus .
for he was a good man , and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith , and many people were added to the Lord .
Peter therefore was kept in the prison , but constant prayer was made by the assembly to God for him .
the same night when Her@@ od was about to bring him out , Peter was sleeping between two soldiers , bound with two chains . guards in front of the door kept the prison .
and behold , an angel of the Lord stood by him , and a light shone in the cell . he struck Peter on the side , and woke him up , saying , " Stand up quickly ! " his chains fell off from his hands .
the angel said to him , " Get dressed and put on your sand@@ als . " he did so . he said to him , " P@@ ut on your cloak , and follow me . "
and he went out and followed him . he did@@ n '@@ t know that what was being done by the angel was real , but thought he saw a vision .
when Peter had come to himself , he said , " Now I truly know that the Lord has sent out his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Her@@ od , and from everything the Jewish people were expecting . "
thinking about that , he came to the house of Mary , the mother of John whose surname was Mark , where many were gathered together and were praying .
but he , bec@@ k@@ oning to them with his hand to be silent , declared to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison . he said , " Tell these things to James , and to the brothers . " then he departed , and went to another place .
now as soon as it was day , there was no small stir among the soldiers about what had become of Peter .
when Her@@ od had sought for him , and did@@ n '@@ t find him , he examined the guards , and commanded that they should be put to death . he went down from Ju@@ dea to Caes@@ area , and stayed there .
as they served the Lord and fast@@ ed , the Holy Spirit said , " Se@@ par@@ ate Bar@@ nab@@ as and Saul for me , for the work to which I have called them . "
so , being sent out by the Holy Spirit , they went down to Sel@@ eu@@ cia . from there they s@@ ailed to Cyprus .
who was with the Pro@@ consu@@ l , Sergi@@ us PA@@ UL@@ US , a man of understanding . this man summoned Bar@@ nab@@ as and Saul , and sought to hear the word of God .
and said , " Full of all dece@@ it and all cunning , you son of the devil , you enemy of all righteousness , will you not cease to perver@@ t the right ways of the Lord ?
but they , passing on from Per@@ ga , came to Anti@@ o@@ ch of Pi@@ si@@ dia . they went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day , and sat down .
after the reading of the law and the prophets , the rulers of the synagogue sent to them , saying , " Brothers , if you have any word of ex@@ hor@@ tation for the people , speak . "
Paul stood up , and bec@@ k@@ oning with his hand said , " Men of Israel , and you who fear God , listen .
when he had removed him , he raised up David to be their king , to whom he also testified , ' I have found David the son of Jes@@ se , a man after my heart , who will do all my will . '
as John was fulfilling his course , he said , ' What do you suppose that I am ? I am not he . but behold , one comes after me the sand@@ als of whose feet I am not worthy to unti@@ e . '
brothers , children of the stock of Abraham , and those among you who fear God , the word of this salvation is sent out to you .
" concerning that he raised him up from the dead , now no more to return to corruption , he has spoken thus : ' I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David . '
and by him everyone who believes is justified from all things , from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses .
'@@ Be@@ hold , you s@@ coff@@ ers , and wonder , and perish ; for I work a work in your days , a work which you will in no way believe , if one declares it to you . ' "
so when the Jews went out of the synagogue , the Genti@@ les beg@@ ged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath .
but when the Jews saw the multi@@ tudes , they were filled with jealousy , and contradic@@ ted the things which were spoken by Paul , and bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed .
as the Genti@@ les heard this , they were glad , and glori@@ fied the word of God . as many as were appointed to eternal life believed .
but the Jews stirred up the dev@@ out and prominent women and the chief men of the city , and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Bar@@ nab@@ as , and threw them out of their borders .
it happened in I@@ con@@ ium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews , and so spoke that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed .
therefore they stayed there a long time , speaking boldly in the Lord , who testified to the word of his grace , granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands .
said with a loud voice , " Stand upright on your feet ! " he le@@ aped up and walked .
when the multitude saw what Paul had done , they lifted up their voice , saying in the language of Ly@@ ca@@ onia , " The gods have come down to us in the lik@@ eness of men ! "
the priest of Jupiter , whose temple was in front of their city , brought ox@@ en and gar@@ lands to the gates , and would have made a sacrifice along with the multi@@ tudes .
yet he did@@ n '@@ t leave himself without witness , in that he did good and gave you rains from the sky and fruitful seasons , filling our hearts with food and gl@@ ad@@ ness . "
but as the disciples stood around him , he rose up , and entered into the city . on the next day he went out with Bar@@ nab@@ as to Der@@ be .
when they had preached the Good News to that city , and had made many disciples , they returned to Ly@@ stra , I@@ con@@ ium , and Anti@@ o@@ ch ,
confirming the souls of the disciples , ex@@ hor@@ ting them to continue in the faith , and that through many afflic@@ tions we must enter into the Kingdom of God .
when they had appointed elders for them in every assembly , and had prayed with fasting , they commended them to the Lord , on whom they had believed .
from there they s@@ ailed to Anti@@ o@@ ch , from where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled .
therefore when Paul and Bar@@ nab@@ as had no small discord and discussion with them , they appointed Paul and Bar@@ nab@@ as , and some others of them , to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question .
they , being sent on their way by the assembly , passed through both Phoen@@ icia and Sam@@ aria , declaring the conversion of the Genti@@ les . they caused great joy to all the brothers .
when there had been much discussion , Peter rose up and said to them , " Brothers , you know that a good while ago God made a choice among you , that by my mouth the nations should hear the word of the Good News , and believe .
God , who knows the heart , testified about them , giving them the Holy Spirit , just like he did to us .
now therefore why do you temp@@ t God , that you should put a y@@ oke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear ?
'@@ After these things I will return . I will again build the tab@@ ern@@ acle of David , which has fallen . I will again build its ruins . I will set it up ,
that the rest of men may seek after the Lord ; All the Genti@@ les who are called by my name , S@@ ays the Lord , who does all these things .
they wrote these things by their hand : " the apostles , the elders , and the brothers , to the brothers who are of the Genti@@ les in Anti@@ o@@ ch , Syria , and C@@ il@@ icia : greetings .
because we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words , un@@ settling your souls , saying , ' You must be circum@@ c@@ ised and keep the law , ' to whom we gave no commandment ;
it seemed good to us , having come to one accord , to choose out men and send them to you with our beloved Bar@@ nab@@ as and Paul ,
we have sent therefore Jud@@ as and Sil@@ as , who themselves will also tell you the same things by word of mouth .
for it seemed good to the Holy Spirit , and to us , to lay no greater burden on you than these necessary things :
after they had spent some time there , they were sent back with greetings from the brothers to the apostles .
after some days Paul said to Bar@@ nab@@ as , " Let 's return now and visit our brothers in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord , to see how they are doing . "
he came to Der@@ be and Ly@@ stra : and behold , a certain disciple was there , named Timothy , the son of a Jew@@ ess who believed ; but his father was a Greek .
when they had gone through the region of Ph@@ ry@@ gia and Gal@@ atia , they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia .
when they had come opposite My@@ sia , they tried to go into Bi@@ thy@@ nia , but the Spirit did@@ n '@@ t allow them .
a vision appeared to Paul in the night . there was a man of Macedonia standing , begging him , and saying , " Come over into Macedonia and help us . "
and from there to Philipp@@ i , which is a city of Macedonia , the foremost of the district , a Roman colony . we were staying some days in this city .
on the Sabbath day we went forth outside of the city by a river@@ side , where we supposed there was a place of prayer , and we sat down , and spoke to the women who had come together .
a certain woman named Ly@@ dia , a seller of purple , of the city of T@@ hy@@ ati@@ ra , one who worshi@@ ped God , heard us ; whose heart the Lord opened to listen to the things which were spoken by Paul .
when she and her household were baptized , she beg@@ ged us , saying , " If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord , come into my house , and stay . " so she persuaded us .
she was doing this for many days . but Paul , becoming greatly anno@@ yed , turned and said to the spirit , " I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her ! " it came out that very hour .
but when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone , they seized Paul and Sil@@ as , and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers .
when they had brought them to the magistr@@ ates , they said , " These men , being Jews , are ag@@ itating our city ,
the multitude rose up together against them , and the magistr@@ ates t@@ ore their clothes off of them , and commanded them to be beaten with rods .
who , having received such a command , threw them into the inner prison , and secured their feet in the stocks .
but about midnight Paul and Sil@@ as were praying and singing hym@@ ns to God , and the prisoners were listening to them .
suddenly there was a great earthquake , so that the foundations of the prison were shaken ; and immediately all the doors were opened , and everyone 's bonds were loos@@ ened .
the j@@ ailer , being r@@ oused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open , drew his sword and was about to kill himself , sup@@ posing that the prisoners had escaped .
they spoke the word of the Lord to him , and to all who were in his house .
he brought them up into his house , and set food before them , and rejo@@ iced greatly , with all his household , having believed in God .
but when it was day , the magistr@@ ates sent the ser@@ ge@@ ants , saying , " Let those men go . "
and they came and beg@@ ged them . when they had brought them out , they asked them to depart from the city .
they went out of the prison , and entered into Ly@@ dia 's house . when they had seen the brothers , they encouraged them , and departed .
now when they had passed through A@@ mp@@ hi@@ pol@@ is and Apoll@@ onia , they came to Thess@@ alon@@ ica , where there was a Jewish synagogue .
Paul , as was his custom , went in to them , and for three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures ,
explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead , and saying , " This Jesus , whom I proclaim to you , is the Christ . "
but the un@@ persuaded Jews took along some wicked men from the marketplace , and gathering a crowd , set the city in an upro@@ ar . ass@@ aul@@ ting the house of Jason , they sought to bring them out to the people .
whom Jason has received . these all act contrary to the decrees of Caes@@ ar , saying that there is another king , Jesus ! "
but those who escor@@ ted Paul brought him as far as Athens . receiving a commandment to Sil@@ as and Timothy that they should come to him very quickly , they departed .
now while Paul waited for them at Athens , his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols .
so he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the dev@@ out persons , and in the marketplace every day with those who met him .
they took hold of him , and brought him to the Are@@ op@@ ag@@ us , saying , " May we know what this new teaching is , which is spoken by you ?
Paul stood in the middle of the Are@@ op@@ ag@@ us , and said , " You men of Athens , I perceive that you are very religious in all things .
the God who made the world and all things in it , he , being Lord of heaven and earth , do@@ es@@ n '@@ t dwell in temples made with hands ,
he made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the surface of the earth , having determined appointed seasons , and the boundaries of their dwell@@ ings ,
'@@ For in him we live , and move , and have our being . ' as some of your own poets have said , ' For we are also his offspring . '
when they opposed him and bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed , he shook out his clothing and said to them , " Your blood be on your own heads ! I am clean . from now on , I will go to the Genti@@ les ! "
he departed there , and went into the house of a certain man named Ju@@ st@@ us , one who worshi@@ ped God , whose house was next door to the synagogue .
Cris@@ pus , the ruler of the synagogue , believed in the Lord with all his house . many of the Corinth@@ ians , when they heard , believed and were baptized .
but when Paul was about to open his mouth , G@@ alli@@ o said to the Jews , " If indeed it were a matter of wrong or of wicked crime , you Jews , it would be reasonable that I should bear with you ;
but if they are questions about words and names and your own law , look to it yourselves . for I don '@@ t want to be a judge of these matters . "
then all the Greeks laid hold on S@@ os@@ then@@ es , the ruler of the synagogue , and beat him before the judgment seat . G@@ alli@@ o did@@ n '@@ t care about any of these things .
Paul , having stayed after this many more days , took his leave of the brothers , and s@@ ailed from there for Syria , together with P@@ ris@@ c@@ illa and Aqu@@ ila . he sha@@ ved his head in Cen@@ ch@@ re@@ ae , for he had a vo@@ w .
he came to E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , and he left them there ; but he himself entered into the synagogue , and reasoned with the Jews .
having spent some time there , he departed , and went through the region of Gal@@ atia , and Ph@@ ry@@ gia , in order , establishing all the disciples .
now a certain Jew named A@@ pol@@ los , an Alexand@@ rian by race , an eloqu@@ ent man , came to E@@ ph@@ es@@ us . he was mighty in the Scriptures .
when he had determined to pass over into Ac@@ ha@@ ia , the brothers encouraged him , and wrote to the disciples to receive him . when he had come , he greatly helped those who had believed through grace ;
it happened that , while A@@ pol@@ los was at Cor@@ inth , Paul , having passed through the upper country , came to E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , and found certain disciples .
he said to them , " Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed ? " they said to him , " No , we haven '@@ t even heard that there is a Holy Spirit . "
this became known to all , both Jews and Greeks , who lived at E@@ ph@@ es@@ us . fear fell on them all , and the name of the Lord Jesus was magni@@ fied .
many of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all . they counted their price , and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver .
now after these things had ended , Paul determined in the spirit , when he had passed through Macedonia and Ac@@ ha@@ ia , to go to Jerusalem , saying , " After I have been there , I must also see Rome . "
for a certain man named Dem@@ et@@ ri@@ us , a sil@@ vers@@ mith , who made silver shr@@ ines of Ar@@ tem@@ is , brought no little business to the craftsmen ,
whom he gathered together , with the work@@ men of like occupation , and said , " S@@ irs , you know that by this business we have our wealth .
not only is there danger that this our trade come into dis@@ rep@@ ute , but also that the temple of the great go@@ ddess Ar@@ tem@@ is will be counted as nothing , and her maj@@ esty destroyed , whom all Asia and the world wor@@ ships . "
they brought Alexander out of the multitude , the Jews putting him forward . Alexander bec@@ k@@ oned with his hand , and would have made a defense to the people .
but when they perceived that he was a Jew , all with one voice for a time of about two hours cried out , " Great is Ar@@ tem@@ is of the Ep@@ he@@ sians ! "
for indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this day 's riot , there being no cause . concerning it , we w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t be able to give an account of this com@@ motion . "
when he had gone through those parts , and had encouraged them with many words , he came into Greece .
on the first day of the week , when the disciples were gathered together to break bread , Paul talked with them , inten@@ ding to depart on the next day , and continued his speech until midnight .
a certain young man named E@@ ut@@ y@@ ch@@ us sat in the window , weighed down with deep sleep . as Paul spoke still longer , being weighed down by his sleep , he fell down from the third story , and was taken up dead .
but we who went ahead to the ship set sail for As@@ so@@ s , inten@@ ding to take Paul aboard there , for he had so arranged , inten@@ ding himself to go by land .
for Paul had determined to sail past E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , that he might not have to spend time in Asia ; for he was ha@@ st@@ ening , if it were possible for him , to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentec@@ ost .
serving the Lord with all humility , with many tears , and with trials which happened to me by the plots of the Jews ;
but these things don '@@ t count ; nor do I hold my life dear to myself , so that I may finish my race with joy , and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus , to fully testify to the Good News of the grace of God .
take heed , therefore , to yourselves , and to all the flock , in which the Holy Spirit has made you over@@ se@@ ers , to shepherd the assembly of the Lord and God which he purchased with his own blood .
in all things I gave you an example , that so lab@@ oring you ought to help the weak , and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus , that he himself said , ' It is more blessed to give than to receive . ' "
sor@@ rowing most of all because of the word which he had spoken , that they should see his face no more . and they accompanied him to the ship .
when it happened that we had parted from them and had set sail , we came with a straight course to C@@ os , and the next day to Rhodes , and from there to Pat@@ ara .
when we had come in sight of Cyprus , leaving it on the left hand , we s@@ ailed to Syria , and landed at Ty@@ re , for there the ship was to un@@ load her cargo .
on the next day , we , who were Paul 's companions , departed , and came to Caes@@ area . we entered into the house of Philip the evangel@@ ist , who was one of the seven , and stayed with him .
then Paul answered , " What are you doing , we@@ eping and breaking my heart ? for I am ready not only to be bound , but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus . "
but concerning the Genti@@ les who believe , we have written our decision that they should observe no such thing , except that they should keep themselves from food offered to idols , from blood , from strang@@ led things , and from sexual im@@ morality . "
then Paul took the men , and the next day , purified himself and went with them into the temple , declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification , until the offering was offered for every one of them .
when the seven days were almost completed , the Jews from Asia , when they saw him in the temple , stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him ,
for they had seen Tro@@ ph@@ im@@ us , the Ep@@ he@@ sian , with him in the city , and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple .
as they were trying to kill him , news came up to the commanding officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an upro@@ ar .
immediately he took soldiers and cent@@ ur@@ ions , and ran down to them . they , when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers , stopped beating Paul .
then the commanding officer came near , arrested him , commanded him to be bound with two chains , and inqui@@ red who he was and what he had done .
some shouted one thing , and some another , among the crowd . when he cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t find out the truth because of the noise , he commanded him to be brought into the bar@@ racks .
when he came to the stairs , it happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd ;
as Paul was about to be brought into the bar@@ racks , he asked the commanding officer , " May I speak to you ? " he said , " Do you know Greek ?
are@@ n '@@ t you then the Egyptian , who before these days stirred up to se@@ dition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Ass@@ ass@@ ins ? "
when he had given him permission , Paul , standing on the stairs , bec@@ k@@ oned with his hand to the people . when there was a great silence , he spoke to them in the Hebrew language , saying ,
as also the high priest and all the council of the elders testify , from whom also I received letters to the brothers , and traveled to Damascus to bring them also who were there to Jerusalem in bonds to be punished .
I fell to the ground , and heard a voice saying to me , ' Saul , Saul , why are you persec@@ uting me ? '
I answered , ' Who are you , Lord ? ' he said to me , ' I am Jesus of Naz@@ areth , whom you persec@@ ute . '
" those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid , but they did@@ n '@@ t understand the voice of him who spoke to me .
I said , ' What shall I do , Lord ? ' the Lord said to me , ' A@@ rise , and go into Damascus . there you will be told about all things which are appointed for you to do . '
when I cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t see for the glory of that light , being led by the hand of those who were with me , I came into Damascus .
one An@@ ani@@ as , a dev@@ out man according to the law , well reported of by all the Jews who lived in Damascus ,
came to me , and standing by me said to me , ' Brother Saul , receive your sight ! ' in that very hour I looked up at him .
he said , ' The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will , and to see the Ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous One , and to hear a voice from his mouth .
now why do you wait ? arise , be baptized , and wash away your sins , calling on the name of the Lord . '
they listened to him until he said that ; then they lifted up their voice , and said , " rid the earth of this fellow , for he is@@ n '@@ t fit to live ! "
when the cent@@ ur@@ ion heard it , he went to the commanding officer and told him , " Watch what you are about to do , for this man is a Roman ! "
the commanding officer answered , " I bought my citizenship for a great price . " Paul said , " But I was born a Roman . "
immediately those who were about to examine him departed from him , and the commanding officer also was afraid when he realized that he was a Roman , because he had bound him .
but on the next day , desi@@ ring to know the truth about why he was accused by the Jews , he freed him from the bonds , and commanded the chief priests and all the council to come together , and brought Paul down and set him before them .
then Paul said to him , " God will strike you , you whit@@ ew@@ ashed wall ! do you sit to judge me according to the law , and command me to be struck contrary to the law ? "
but when Paul perceived that the one part were Sad@@ duc@@ ees and the other Pharis@@ ees , he cried out in the council , " Men and brothers , I am a Pharis@@ ee , a son of Pharis@@ ees . concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged ! "
a great clam@@ or arose , and some of the scri@@ bes of the Pharis@@ ees part stood up , and cont@@ ended , saying , " We find no evil in this man . but if a spirit or angel has spoken to him , let 's not fight against God ! "
when a great argument arose , the commanding officer , fearing that Paul would be torn in pieces by them , commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them , and bring him into the bar@@ racks .
the following night , the Lord stood by him , and said , " Che@@ er up , Paul , for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem , so you must testify also at Rome . "
they came to the chief priests and the elders , and said , " We have bound ourselves under a great curse , to taste nothing until we have killed Paul .
but Paul 's sister 's son heard of their lying in wait , and he came and entered into the bar@@ racks and told Paul .
Paul summoned one of the cent@@ ur@@ ions , and said , " B@@ ring this young man to the commanding officer , for he has something to tell him . "
so he took him , and brought him to the commanding officer , and said , " Paul , the prisoner , summoned me and asked me to bring this young man to you , who has something to tell you . "
the commanding officer took him by the hand , and going aside , asked him privately , " What is it that you have to tell me ? "
therefore don '@@ t yield to them , for more than forty men lie in wait for him , who have bound themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him . now they are ready , looking for the promise from you . "
" this man was seized by the Jews , and was about to be killed by them , when I came with the soldiers and rescued him , having learned that he was a Roman .
" I will hear you fully when your acc@@ users also arrive . " he commanded that he be kept in Her@@ od 's palace .
after five days , the high priest , An@@ ani@@ as , came down with certain elders and an or@@ ator , one Ter@@ t@@ ul@@ l@@ us . they informed the governor against Paul .
we accept it in all ways and in all places , most excellent Felix , with all thank@@ fulness .
when the governor had bec@@ k@@ oned to him to speak , Paul answered , " Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation for many years , I cheer@@ fully make my defense ,
but this I confess to you , that after the Way , which they call a sect , so I serve the God of our fathers , believing all things which are according to the law , and which are written in the prophets ;
having hope toward God , which these also themselves look for , that there will be a resurrection of the dead , both of the just and unjust .
now after some years , I came to bring gifts for the ne@@ edy to my nation , and offerings ;
amid which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple , not with a mob , nor with turmoil .
but Felix , having more exact knowledge concerning the Way , deferred them , saying , " When Ly@@ si@@ as , the commanding officer , comes down , I will decide your case . "
he ordered the cent@@ ur@@ ion that Paul should be kept in custody , and should have some privileges , and not to forbid any of his friends to serve him or to visit him .
but after some days , Felix came with Dr@@ us@@ illa , his wife , who was a Jew@@ ess , and sent for Paul , and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus .
as he reasoned about righteousness , self @@@ -@@ @ control , and the judgment to come , Felix was terrified , and answered , " Go your way for this time , and when it is convenient for me , I will sum@@ mon you . "
meanwhile , he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul , that he might release him . therefore also he sent for him more often , and talked with him .
but when two years were fulfilled , Felix was succeeded by Por@@ ci@@ us F@@ est@@ us , and desi@@ ring to gain favor with the Jews , Felix left Paul in bonds .
" let them therefore , " said he , " that are in power among you go down with me , and if there is anything wrong in the man , let them accuse him . "
when he had stayed among them more than ten days , he went down to Caes@@ area , and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat , and commanded Paul to be brought .
when he had come , the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him , bringing against him many and griev@@ ous charges which they could not prove ,
but F@@ est@@ us , desi@@ ring to gain favor with the Jews , answered Paul and said , " Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem , and be judged by me there concerning these things ? "
but Paul said , " I am standing before Caes@@ ar 's judgment seat , where I ought to be tried . I have done no wrong to the Jews , as you also know very well .
for if I have done wrong , and have committed anything worthy of death , I don '@@ t refuse to die ; but if none of those things is true that they accuse me of , no one can give me up to them . I appeal to Caes@@ ar ! "
then F@@ est@@ us , when he had conferred with the council , answered , " You have appealed to Caes@@ ar . to Caes@@ ar you shall go . "
now when some days had passed , King A@@ gri@@ pp@@ a and Ber@@ nice arrived at Caes@@ area , and greeted F@@ est@@ us .
about whom , when I was at Jerusalem , the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me , asking for a sentence against him .
A@@ gri@@ pp@@ a said to F@@ est@@ us , " I also would like to hear the man myself . " " tomorrow , " he said , " you shall hear him . "
F@@ est@@ us said , " King A@@ gri@@ pp@@ a , and all men who are here present with us , you see this man , about whom all the multitude of the Jews peti@@ tioned me , both at Jerusalem and here , crying that he ought not to live any longer .
of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord . therefore I have brought him forth before you , and especially before you , King A@@ gri@@ pp@@ a , that , after examination , I may have something to write .
for it seems to me unreasonable , in sending a prisoner , not to also specify the charges against him . "
" indeed , all the Jews know my way of life from my youth up , which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem ;
having known me from the first , if they are willing to testify , that after the stric@@ test sect of our religion I lived a Pharis@@ ee .
" I myself most certainly thought that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Naz@@ areth .
this I also did in Jerusalem . I both shut up many of the saints in prisons , having received authority from the chief priests , and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them .
at noon , O king , I saw on the way a light from the sky , brighter than the sun , shining around me and those who traveled with me .
when we had all fallen to the earth , I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language , ' Saul , Saul , why are you persec@@ uting me ? it is hard for you to kick against the go@@ ads . '
" I said , ' Who are you , Lord ? ' " he said , ' I am Jesus , whom you are persec@@ uting .
but arise , and stand on your feet , for I have appeared to you for this purpose : to appoint you a servant and a witness both of the things which you have seen , and of the things which I will reveal to you ;
to open their eyes , that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God , that they may receive rem@@ is@@ sion of sins and an inheritance among those who are sancti@@ fied by faith in me . '
but declared first to them of Damascus , at Jerusalem , and throughout all the country of Ju@@ dea , and also to the Genti@@ les , that they should repent and turn to God , doing works worthy of repentance .
how the Christ must suffer , and how , by the resurrection of the dead , he would be first to proclaim light both to these people and to the Genti@@ les . "
as he thus made his defense , F@@ est@@ us said with a loud voice , " Paul , you are crazy ! your great learning is driving you insane ! "
Paul said , " I pray to God , that whether with little or with much , not only you , but also all that hear me this day , might become such as I am , except for these bonds . "
A@@ gri@@ pp@@ a said to F@@ est@@ us , " This man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caes@@ ar . "
when it was determined that we should sail for Italy , they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a cent@@ ur@@ ion named Juli@@ us , of the Augu@@ stan band .
and said to them , " S@@ irs , I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss , not only of the cargo and the ship , but also of our lives . "
when the south wind blew softly , sup@@ posing that they had obtained their purpose , they weighed anchor and s@@ ailed along Crete , close to shore .
when the ship was caught , and cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t face the wind , we gave way to it , and were driven along .
running under the le@@ e of a small island called Cla@@ ud@@ a , we were able , with difficulty , to secure the boat .
as we lab@@ ored exceedingly with the storm , the next day they began to throw things over@@ board .
when neither sun nor stars shone on us for many days , and no small storm pressed on us , all hope that we would be saved was now taken away .
when they had been long without food , Paul stood up in the middle of them , and said , " S@@ irs , you should have listened to me , and not have set sail from Crete , and have gotten this injury and loss .
therefore , si@@ rs , che@@ er up ! for I believe God , that it will be just as it has been spoken to me .
but when the four@@ teenth night had come , as we were driven back and forth in the Adriatic Sea , about midnight the sailors sur@@ mis@@ ed that they were drawing near to some land .
as the sailors were trying to flee out of the ship , and had lowered the boat into the sea , pretending that they would lay out anch@@ ors from the bow ,
Paul said to the cent@@ ur@@ ion and to the soldiers , " Un@@ less these stay in the ship , you can '@@ t be saved . "
while the day was coming on , Paul beg@@ ged them all to take some food , saying , " This day is the four@@ teenth day that you wait and continue fasting , having taken nothing .
but the cent@@ ur@@ ion , desi@@ ring to save Paul , stopped them from their purpose , and commanded that those who could swim should throw themselves over@@ board first to go toward the land ;
and the rest should follow , some on plan@@ ks , and some on other things from the ship . so it happened that they all escaped safely to the land .
the natives showed us uncommon kindness ; for they kind@@ led a fire , and received us all , because of the present rain , and because of the cold .
but when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire , a vi@@ per came out because of the heat , and fast@@ ened on his hand .
when the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand , they said one to another , " No doubt this man is a murderer , whom , though he has escaped from the sea , yet Justice has not allowed to live . "
from there we cir@@ cled around and arrived at R@@ he@@ gi@@ um . after one day , a south wind sprang up , and on the second day we came to Put@@ e@@ ol@@ i ,
when we entered into Rome , the cent@@ ur@@ ion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard , but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him .
for this cause therefore I asked to see you and to speak with you . for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain . "
but we desire to hear from you what you think . for , as concerning this sect , it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against . "
when they did@@ n '@@ t agree among themselves , they departed after Paul had spoken one word , " The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah , the prophet , to our fathers ,
who was declared to be the Son of God with power , according to the Spirit of hol@@ iness , by the resurrection from the dead , Jesus Christ our Lord ,
through whom we received grace and apost@@ les@@ hip , for obedience of faith among all the nations , for his name 's sake ;
to all who are in Rome , beloved of God , called to be saints : grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
for I am not ashamed of the Good News of Christ , for it is the power of God for salvation for everyone who believes ; for the Jew first , and also for the Greek .
for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all un@@ god@@ liness and un@@ righteousness of men , who suppress the truth in un@@ righteousness ,
who exchanged the truth of God for a lie , and worshi@@ ped and served the creature rather than the Creator , who is blessed forever . A@@ men .
likewise also the men , leaving the natural function of the woman , burned in their lust toward one another , men doing what is inappropriate with men , and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error .
even as they refused to have God in their knowledge , God gave them up to a re@@ prob@@ ate mind , to do those things which are not fitting ;
who , knowing the ordin@@ ance of God , that those who practice such things are worthy of death , not only do the same , but also approve of those who practice them .
do you think this , O man who judges those who practice such things , and do the same , that you will escape the judgment of God ?
or do you desp@@ ise the riches of his goodness , for@@ bear@@ ance , and patience , not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance ?
but according to your hard@@ ness and un@@ repent@@ ant heart you are treas@@ uring up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath , revelation , and of the righteous judgment of God ;
but to those who are self @@@ -@@ @ seeking , and don '@@ t obey the truth , but obey un@@ righteousness , will be wrath and indignation ,
and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind , a light to those who are in darkness ,
why not ( as we are slan@@ der@@ ously reported , and as some affirm that we say ) , " Let us do evil , that good may come ? " those who say so are justly condemned .
now we know that whatever things the law says , it speaks to those who are under the law , that every mouth may be closed , and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God .
but now apart from the law , a righteousness of God has been revealed , being testified by the law and the prophets ;
even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all those who believe . for there is no distinction ,
where then is the bo@@ asting ? it is excluded . by what kind of law ? of works ? no , but by a law of faith .
or is God the God of Jews only ? is@@ n '@@ t he the God of Genti@@ les also ? yes , of Genti@@ les also ,
for if Abraham was justified by works , he has something to boast about , but not toward God .
for what does the Scripture say ? " Abraham believed God , and it was accounted to him for righteousness . "
is this blessing then pronounced on the circum@@ c@@ ised , or on the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised also ? for we say that faith was accounted to Abraham for righteousness .
how then was it counted ? when he was in circum@@ cision , or in un@@ circum@@ cision ? not in circum@@ cision , but in un@@ circum@@ cision .
he is the father of circum@@ cision to those who not only are of the circum@@ cision , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham , which he had in un@@ circum@@ cision .
for the promise to Abraham and to his seed that he should be heir of the world was@@ n '@@ t through the law , but through the righteousness of faith .
who in hope believed against hope , to the end that he might become a father of many nations , according to that which had been spoken , " So will your seed be . "
without being weakened in faith , he did@@ n '@@ t consider his own body , already having been worn out , ( he being about a hundred years old ) , and the dead@@ ness of Sarah 's womb .
through whom we also have our access by faith into this grace in which we stand . we rejoice in hope of the glory of God .
and hope do@@ es@@ n '@@ t dis@@ appoint us , because God 's love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us .
for if , while we were enemies , we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son , much more , being reconciled , we will be saved by his life .
but the free gift is@@ n '@@ t like the t@@ resp@@ ass . for if by the t@@ resp@@ ass of the one the many died , much more did the grace of God , and the gift by the grace of the one man , Jesus Christ , abound to the many .
so then as through one t@@ resp@@ ass , all men were condemned ; even so through one act of righteousness , all men were justified to life .
we were buried therefore with him through baptism to death , that just like Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father , so we also might walk in new@@ ness of life .
for if we have become united with him in the lik@@ eness of his death , we will also be part of his resurrection ;
knowing this , that our old man was cruci@@ fied with him , that the body of sin might be done away with , so that we would no longer be in bond@@ age to sin .
but thanks be to God , that , whereas you were bond@@ servants of sin , you became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching where@@ unto you were delivered .
what fruit then did you have at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed ? for the end of those things is death .
but now , being made free from sin , and having become servants of God , you have your fruit of sanc@@ tification , and the result of eternal life .
or don '@@ t you know , brothers ( for I speak to men who know the law ) , that the law has dom@@ inion over a man for as long as he lives ?
but now we have been discharged from the law , having died to that in which we were held ; so that we serve in new@@ ness of the spirit , and not in old@@ ness of the letter .
what shall we say then ? is the law sin ? may it never be ! however , I w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have known sin , except through the law . for I w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have known cov@@ eting , unless the law had said , " You shall not co@@ vet . "
but sin , finding occasion through the commandment , produced in me all kinds of cov@@ eting . for apart from the law , sin is dead .
therefore the law indeed is holy , and the commandment holy , and righteous , and good .
did then that which is good become death to me ? may it never be ! but sin , that it might be shown to be sin , by working death to me through that which is good ; that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful .
for I don '@@ t know what I am doing . for I don '@@ t practice what I desire to do ; but what I hate , that I do .
for the good which I desire , I don '@@ t do ; but the evil which I don '@@ t desire , that I practice .
but if what I don '@@ t desire , that I do , it is no more I that do it , but sin which d@@ wells in me .
but I see a different law in my members , war@@ ring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into cap@@ tivity under the law of sin which is in my members .
I thank God through Jesus Christ , our Lord ! so then with the mind , I myself serve God 's law , but with the flesh , the sin 's law .
there is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus , who don '@@ t walk according to the flesh , but according to the Spirit .
for what the law cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God did , sending his own Son in the lik@@ eness of sinful flesh and for sin , he condemned sin in the flesh ;
that the ordin@@ ance of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
because the mind of the flesh is hostile towards God ; for it is not subject to God 's law , neither indeed can it be .
but you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit , if it is so that the Spirit of God d@@ wells in you . but if any man do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have the Spirit of Christ , he is not his .
but if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead d@@ wells in you , he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who d@@ wells in you .
so then , brothers , we are debtors , not to the flesh , to live after the flesh .
and if children , then heirs ; heirs of God , and joint heirs with Christ ; if indeed we suffer with him , that we may also be glori@@ fied with him .
for the creation was subjected to van@@ ity , not of its own will , but because of him who subjected it , in hope
not only so , but ourselves also , who have the first fruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves gro@@ an within ourselves , waiting for adoption , the redemption of our body .
in the same way , the Spirit also helps our weaknesses , for we don '@@ t know how to pray as we ought . but the Spirit himself makes interc@@ ession for us with gro@@ an@@ ings which can '@@ t be uttered .
he who searches the hearts knows what is on the Spirit 's mind , because he makes interc@@ ession for the saints according to God .
we know that all things work together for good for those who love God , to those who are called according to his purpose .
for whom he fore@@ knew , he also pre@@ destined to be con@@ formed to the image of his Son , that he might be the fir@@ st@@ born among many brothers .
he who did@@ n '@@ t spare his own Son , but delivered him up for us all , how would he not also with him freely give us all things ?
nor height , nor depth , nor any other created thing , will be able to separate us from the love of God , which is in Christ Jesus our Lord .
I tell the truth in Christ . I am not lying , my conscience testi@@ fying with me in the Holy Spirit ,
for I could wish that I myself were accur@@ sed from Christ for my brothers ' sake , my relatives according to the flesh ,
of whom are the fathers , and from whom is Christ as concerning the flesh , who is over all , God , blessed forever . A@@ men .
but it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing . for they are not all Israel , that are of Israel .
neither , because they are Abraham 's seed , are they all children . but , " In Isaac will your seed be called . "
for this is a word of promise , " At the appointed time I will come , and Sarah will have a son . "
for the Scripture says to Phar@@ aoh , " For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up , that I might show in you my power , and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth . "
but indeed , O man , who are you to reply against God ? will the thing formed ask him who formed it , " Why did you make me like this ? "
and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy , which he prepared beforehand for glory ,
Isaiah cries concerning Israel , " If the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea , it is the remn@@ ant who will be saved ;
as Isaiah has said before , " Un@@ less the Lord of Arm@@ ies had left us a seed , we would have become like So@@ dom , and would have been made like Gom@@ or@@ rah . "
but Israel , following after a law of righteousness , did@@ n '@@ t arrive at the law of righteousness .
why ? because they did@@ n '@@ t seek it by faith , but as it were by works of the law . they stum@@ bled over the stumbling stone ;
even as it is written , " Be@@ hold , I lay in Z@@ ion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense ; and no one who believes in him will be disappointed . "
for being ignorant of God 's righteousness , and seeking to establish their own righteousness , they did@@ n '@@ t subject themselves to the righteousness of God .
but what does it say ? " the word is near you , in your mouth , and in your heart " ; that is , the word of faith , which we preach :
that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord , and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead , you will be saved .
for there is no distinction between Jew and Greek ; for the same Lord is Lord of all , and is rich to all who call on him .
how then will they call on him in whom they have not believed ? how will they believe in him whom they have not heard ? how will they hear without a preacher ?
but they did@@ n '@@ t all listen to the glad news . for Isaiah says , " Lord , who has believed our report ? "
but I say , did@@ n '@@ t they hear ? yes , most certainly , " Their sound went out into all the earth , their words to the ends of the world . "
but as to Israel he says , " All day long I stretched out my hands to a dis@@ obedient and contrary people . "
I ask then , did God reject his people ? may it never be ! for I also am an Israel@@ ite , a desc@@ endant of Abraham , of the tribe of Benjamin .
but how does God answer him ? " I have reserved for myself seven thousand men , who have not bowed the knee to Ba@@ al . "
even so then at this present time also there is a remn@@ ant according to the election of grace .
what then ? that which Israel seeks for , that he did@@ n '@@ t obtain , but the chosen ones obtained it , and the rest were hardened .
according as it is written , " God gave them a spirit of stup@@ or , eyes that they should not see , and ears that they should not hear , to this very day . "
I ask then , did they stum@@ ble that they might fall ? may it never be ! but by their fall salvation has come to the Genti@@ les , to provoke them to jealousy .
now if their fall is the riches of the world , and their loss the riches of the Genti@@ les ; how much more their full@@ ness ?
for if the rejection of them is the reconc@@ iling of the world , what would their acceptance be , but life from the dead ?
true ; by their un@@ belief they were broken off , and you stand by your faith . Don '@@ t be conce@@ ited , but fear ;
see then the goodness and severity of God . toward those who fell , severity ; but toward you , goodness , if you continue in his goodness ; otherwise you also will be cut off .
they also , if they don '@@ t continue in their un@@ belief , will be gra@@ fted in , for God is able to gra@@ ft them in again .
even so these also have now been dis@@ obedient , that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy .
therefore I urge you , brothers , by the mer@@ cies of God , to present your bodies a living sacrifice , holy , acceptable to God , which is your spiritual service .
Don '@@ t be con@@ formed to this world , but be transformed by the renew@@ ing of your mind , so that you may prove what is the good , well @@@ -@@ @ pleasing , and perfect will of God .
or he who ex@@ hor@@ ts , to his ex@@ hor@@ ting : he who gives , let him do it with liber@@ ality ; he who rules , with diligence ; he who shows mercy , with cheer@@ fulness .
Don '@@ t seek revenge yourselves , beloved , but give place to God 's wrath . for it is written , " Ven@@ ge@@ ance belongs to me ; I will repay , says the Lord . "
therefore " If your enemy is hungry , feed him . if he is thir@@ sty , give him a drink ; for in doing so , you will heap co@@ als of fire on his head . "
let every soul be in subj@@ ection to the higher authorities , for there is no authority except from God , and those who exist are ordained by God .
therefore you need to be in subj@@ ection , not only because of the wrath , but also for conscience ' sake .
for this reason you also pay taxes , for they are servants of God 's service , attending continually on this very thing .
do this , knowing the time , that it is already time for you to awaken out of sleep , for salvation is now nearer to us than when we first believed .
let us walk properly , as in the day ; not in rev@@ eling and drun@@ ken@@ ness , not in sexual promis@@ cu@@ ity and lu@@ st@@ ful acts , and not in strife and jealousy .
who are you who judge another 's servant ? to his own lord he stands or falls . yes , he will be made to stand , for God has power to make him stand .
for if we live , we live to the Lord . or if we die , we die to the Lord . if therefore we live or die , we are the Lord 's .
but you , why do you judge your brother ? or you again , why do you desp@@ ise your brother ? for we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ .
for it is written , " ' As I live , ' says the Lord , ' to me every knee will bow . every tongue will confess to God . ' "
therefore let 's not judge one another any more , but judge this rather , that no man put a stumbling block in his brother 's way , or an occasion for falling .
I know , and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus , that nothing is un@@ clean of itself ; except that to him who considers anything to be un@@ clean , to him it is un@@ clean .
for even Christ did@@ n '@@ t please himself . but , as it is written , " The repro@@ aches of those who repro@@ ached you fell on me . "
now I say that Christ has been made a servant of the circum@@ cision for the truth of God , that he might confirm the promises given to the fathers ,
now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that you may abound in hope , in the power of the Holy Spirit .
for I will not dare to speak of any things except those which Christ worked through me , for the obedience of the Genti@@ les , by word and deed ,
yes , making it my aim to preach the Good News , not where Christ was already named , that I might not build on another 's foundation .
when therefore I have accomplished this , and have sealed to them this fruit , I will go on by way of you to Spain .
now I beg you , brothers , by our Lord Jesus Christ , and by the love of the Spirit , that you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me ,
that you receive her in the Lord , in a way worthy of the saints , and that you assist her in whatever matter she may need from you , for she herself also has been a hel@@ per of many , and of my own self .
for your obedience has become known to all . I rejoice therefore over you . but I desire to have you wise in that which is good , but innocent in that which is evil .
to the assembly of God which is at Cor@@ inth ; those who are sancti@@ fied in Christ Jesus , called to be saints , with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place , both theirs and ours :
God is faithful , through whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son , Jesus Christ , our Lord .
now I beg you , brothers , through the name of our Lord , Jesus Christ , that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you , but that you be perf@@ ected together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
now I mean this , that each one of you says , " I follow Paul , " " I follow A@@ pol@@ los , " " I follow C@@ ep@@ has , " and , " I follow Christ . "
for Christ sent me not to bap@@ ti@@ ze , but to preach the Good News@@ -@@ -@@ not in wisdom of words , so that the cross of Christ w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t be made void .
for the word of the cross is fool@@ is@@ hness to those who are dying , but to us who are saved it is the power of God .
where is the wise ? where is the scri@@ be ? where is the lawyer of this world ? h@@ as@@ n '@@ t God made foolish the wisdom of this world ?
but to those who are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God .
when I came to you , brothers , I did@@ n '@@ t come with excellence of speech or of wisdom , proclaiming to you the testimony of God .
but we speak God 's wisdom in a mystery , the wisdom that has been hidden , which God fore@@ ordained before the worlds for our glory ,
which none of the rulers of this world has known . for had they known it , they w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t have cruci@@ fied the Lord of glory .
for who among men knows the things of a man , except the spirit of the man , which is in him ? even so , no one knows the things of God , except God 's Spirit .
which things also we speak , not in words which man 's wisdom teaches , but which the Holy Spirit teaches , comparing spiritual things with spiritual things .
" for who has known the mind of the Lord , that he should instruct him ? " but we have Christ 's mind .
for you are still fl@@ esh@@ ly . for insofar as there is jealousy , strife , and factions among you , are@@ n '@@ t you fl@@ esh@@ ly , and don '@@ t you walk in the ways of men ?
according to the grace of God which was given to me , as a wise master builder I laid a foundation , and another builds on it . but let each man be careful how he builds on it .
for the wisdom of this world is fool@@ is@@ hness with God . for it is written , " He has taken the wise in their craft@@ iness . "
so let a man think of us as Christ 's servants , and ste@@ wards of God 's mysteries .
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you , or by man 's judgment . yes , I don '@@ t judge my own self .
for I know nothing against myself . yet I am not justified by this , but he who judges me is the Lord .
therefore judge nothing before the time , until the Lord comes , who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness , and reveal the coun@@ sels of the hearts . then each man will get his praise from God .
now these things , brothers , I have in a figure transferred to myself and A@@ pol@@ los for your s@@ akes , that in us you might learn not to think beyond the things which are written , that none of you be pu@@ ffed up against one another .
for who makes you different ? and what do you have that you did@@ n '@@ t receive ? but if you did receive it , why do you boast as if you had not received it ?
for , I think that God has displayed us , the apostles , last of all , like men sentenced to death . for we are made a spectacle to the world , both to angels and men .
we are fo@@ ols for Christ 's sake , but you are wise in Christ . we are weak , but you are strong . you have honor , but we have dis@@ honor .
being defam@@ ed , we entre@@ at . we are made as the fil@@ th of the world , the dirt wiped off by all , even until now .
for though you have ten thousand t@@ utors in Christ , yet not many fathers . for in Christ Jesus , I became your father through the Good News .
because of this I have sent Timothy to you , who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord , who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ , even as I teach everywhere in every assembly .
for I most certainly , as being absent in body but present in spirit , have already , as though I were present , judged him who has done this thing .
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , you being gathered together , and my spirit , with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
purge out the old yeast , that you may be a new lump , even as you are un@@ leav@@ ened . for indeed Christ , our Pas@@ sover , has been sacrificed in our place .
therefore let us keep the feast , not with old yeast , neither with the yeast of mal@@ ice and w@@ ick@@ edness , but with the un@@ leav@@ ened bread of sincerity and truth .
yet not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world , or with the co@@ vet@@ ous and extor@@ tion@@ ers , or with id@@ ol@@ aters ; for then you would have to leave the world .
I say this to move you to shame . is@@ n '@@ t there even one wise man among you who would be able to decide between his brothers ?
or don '@@ t you know that the un@@ righteous will not inherit the Kingdom of God ? Don '@@ t be deceived . neither the sexually immoral , nor id@@ ol@@ aters , nor adul@@ ter@@ ers , nor male prostitutes , nor homosex@@ uals ,
such were some of you , but you were washed . but you were sancti@@ fied . but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and in the Spirit of our God .
" foods for the belly , and the belly for foods , " but God will bring to nothing both it and them . but the body is not for sexual im@@ morality , but for the Lord ; and the Lord for the body .
Don '@@ t you know that your bodies are members of Christ ? shall I then take the members of Christ , and make them members of a pro@@ stitute ? may it never be !
flee sexual im@@ morality ! " every sin that a man does is outside the body , " but he who commits sexual im@@ morality sins against his own body .
or don '@@ t you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you , which you have from God ? you are not your own ,
but , because of sexual im@@ mor@@ alities , let each man have his own wife , and let each woman have her own husband .
Don '@@ t deprive one another , unless it is by consent for a season , that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer , and may be together again , that Satan do@@ es@@ n '@@ t temp@@ t you because of your lack of self @@@ -@@ @ control .
( but if she de@@ parts , let her remain un@@ married , or else be reconciled to her husband ) , and that the husband not leave his wife .
for the un@@ believing husband is sancti@@ fied in the wife , and the un@@ believing wife is sancti@@ fied in the husband . otherwise your children would be un@@ clean , but now they are holy .
yet if the un@@ believer de@@ parts , let there be separation . the brother or the sister is not under bond@@ age in such cases , but God has called us in peace .
only , as the Lord has distributed to each man , as God has called each , so let him walk . so I command in all the assemblies .
were you called being a bond@@ servant ? Don '@@ t let that bother you , but if you get an opportunity to become free , use it .
now concerning vir@@ gins , I have no commandment from the Lord , but I give my judgment as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy .
are you bound to a wife ? Don '@@ t seek to be freed . are you free from a wife ? Don '@@ t seek a wife .
but if you marry , you have not sin@@ ned . if a virgin mar@@ ries , she has not sin@@ ned . yet such will have oppression in the flesh , and I want to spare you .
but I say this , brothers : the time is short , that from now on , both those who have wives may be as though they had none ;
but if any man thinks that he is behaving in@@ appropriately toward his virgin , if she is past the flower of her age , and if need so requires , let him do what he desires . he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t sin . let them marry .
a wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives ; but if the husband is dead , she is free to be married to wh@@ om@@ ever she desires , only in the Lord .
therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols , we know that no idol is anything in the world , and that there is no other God but one .
for though there are things that are called " gods , " whether in the heavens or on earth ; as there are many " gods " and many " lords " ;
yet to us there is one God , the Father , of whom are all things , and we for him ; and one Lord , Jesus Christ , through whom are all things , and we live through him .
however , that knowledge is@@ n '@@ t in all men . but some , with consciousness of the idol until now , eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol , and their conscience , being weak , is de@@ filed .
but food will not comm@@ end us to God . for neither , if we don '@@ t eat , are we the worse ; nor , if we eat , are we the better .
but be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak .
and through your knowledge , he who is weak per@@ ishes , the brother for whose sake Christ died .
if to others I am not an apostle , yet at least I am to you ; for you are the seal of my apost@@ les@@ hip in the Lord .
what soldier ever serves at his own expense ? who plants a viney@@ ard , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t eat of its fruit ? or who feeds a flock , and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t drink from the flock 's milk ?
do I speak these things according to the ways of men ? or do@@ es@@ n '@@ t the law also say the same thing ?
or does he say it assu@@ re@@ dly for our sake ? yes , it was written for our sake , because he who pl@@ ows ought to plo@@ w in hope , and he who thresh@@ es in hope should par@@ take of his hope .
if others par@@ take of this right over you , don '@@ t we yet more ? nevertheless we did not use this right , but we bear all things , that we may cause no hind@@ r@@ ance to the Good News of Christ .
but I have used none of these things , and I don '@@ t write these things that it may be done so in my case ; for I would rather die , than that anyone should make my bo@@ asting void .
for if I preach the Good News , I have nothing to boast about ; for necessity is laid on me ; but w@@ oe is to me , if I don '@@ t preach the Good News .
for if I do this of my own will , I have a reward . but if not of my own will , I have a stewardship entrusted to me .
what then is my reward ? that , when I preach the Good News , I may present the Good News of Christ without charge , so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News .
for though I was free from all , I brought myself under bond@@ age to all , that I might gain the more .
to those who are without law , as without law ( not being without law toward God , but under law toward Christ ) , that I might win those who are without law .
to the weak I became as weak , that I might gain the weak . I have become all things to all men , that I may by all means save some .
Don '@@ t you know that those who run in a race all run , but one receives the prize ? run like that , that you may win .
neither be id@@ ol@@ aters , as some of them were . as it is written , " The people sat down to eat and drink , and rose up to play . "
the cup of blessing which we bless , is@@ n '@@ t it a sharing of the blood of Christ ? the bread which we break , is@@ n '@@ t it a sharing of the body of Christ ?
but if one of those who don '@@ t believe invites you to a meal , and you are inclined to go , eat whatever is set before you , asking no questions for the sake of conscience .
conscience , I say , not your own , but the other 's conscience . for why is my liberty judged by another conscience ?
even as I also please all men in all things , not seeking my own profit , but the profit of the many , that they may be saved .
now I praise you , brothers , that you remember me in all things , and hold firm the traditions , even as I delivered them to you .
for if a woman is not covered , let her also be shor@@ n . but if it is shameful for a woman to be shor@@ n or sha@@ ved , let her be covered .
for a man indeed ought not to have his head covered , because he is the image and glory of God , but the woman is the glory of the man .
but if a woman has long hair , it is a glory to her , for her hair is given to her for a covering .
for there also must be factions among you , that those who are approved may be revealed among you .
when he had given thanks , he broke it , and said , " Take , eat . this is my body , which is broken for you . do this in memory of me . "
therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord 's cup in a way un@@ worthy of the Lord will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord .
for he who eats and drinks in an un@@ worthy way eats and drinks judgment to himself , if he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t discern the Lord 's body .
but if anyone is hungry , let him eat at home , lest your coming together be for judgment . the rest I will set in order whenever I come .
therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God 's Spirit says , " Jesus is accur@@ sed . " no one can say , " Jesus is Lord , " but by the Holy Spirit .
to another faith , by the same Spirit ; and to another gifts of heal@@ ings , by the same Spirit ;
for in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body , whether Jews or Greeks , whether bond or free ; and were all given to drink into one Spirit .
if the ear would say , " Because I 'm not the eye , I 'm not part of the body , " it 's not therefore not part of the body .
but now God has set the members , each one of them , in the body , just as he desired .
that there should be no division in the body , but that the members should have the same care for one another .
if I speak with the languages of men and of angels , but don '@@ t have love , I have become sounding brass , or a cl@@ ang@@ ing cy@@ mb@@ al .
if I dol@@ e out all my goods to feed the poor , and if I give my body to be burned , but don '@@ t have love , it profits me nothing .
when I was a child , I spoke as a child , I felt as a child , I thought as a child . now that I have become a man , I have put away chil@@ dish things .
for now we see in a mirror , dim@@ ly , but then face to face . now I know in part , but then I will know fully , even as I was also fully known .
even things without life , giving a voice , whether pipe or har@@ p , if they did@@ n '@@ t give a distinction in the sounds , how would it be known what is pi@@ ped or har@@ ped ?
so also you , unless you uttered by the tongue words easy to understand , how would it be known what is spoken ? for you would be speaking into the air .
there are , it may be , so many kinds of sounds in the world , and none of them is without meaning .
otherwise if you bless with the spirit , how will he who fills the place of the un@@ learned say the " A@@ men " at your giving of thanks , seeing he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know what you say ?
however in the assembly I would rather speak five words with my understanding , that I might instruct others also , than ten thousand words in another language .
but if all proph@@ esy , and someone un@@ believing or un@@ learned comes in , he is re@@ proved by all , and he is judged by all .
and thus the secrets of his heart are revealed . so he will fall down on his face and worship God , declaring that God is among you indeed .
what is it then , brothers ? when you come together , each one of you has a p@@ sal@@ m , has a teaching , has a revelation , has another language , has an interpretation . let all things be done to build each other up .
if any man speaks in another language , let it be two , or at the most three , and in turn ; and let one interpret .
let your wives keep silent in the assemblies , for it has not been permitted for them to speak ; but let them be in subj@@ ection , as the law also says .
if they desire to learn anything , let them ask their own husbands at home , for it is shameful for a woman to chat@@ ter in the assembly .
now I declare to you , brothers , the Good News which I preached to you , which also you received , in which you also stand ,
but by the grace of God I am what I am . his grace which was bestowed on me was not futile , but I worked more than all of them ; yet not I , but the grace of God which was with me .
now if Christ is preached , that he has been raised from the dead , how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead ?
then the end comes , when he will deliver up the Kingdom to God , even the Father ; when he will have abolished all rule and all authority and power .
for , " He put all things in subj@@ ection under his feet . " but when he says , " All things are put in subj@@ ection , " it is evident that he is excep@@ ted who subjected all things to him .
or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead ? if the dead are@@ n '@@ t raised at all , why then are they baptized for the dead ?
if I fought with animals at E@@ ph@@ es@@ us for human purposes , what does it profit me ? if the dead are not raised , then " let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we die . "
that which you sow , you don '@@ t sow the body that will be , but a bare grain , maybe of wheat , or of some other kind .
so also is the resurrection of the dead . it is s@@ own in corruption ; it is raised in in@@ corruption .
it is s@@ own in dis@@ honor ; it is raised in glory . it is s@@ own in weakness ; it is raised in power .
the first man is of the earth , made of dust . the second man is the Lord from heaven .
therefore , my beloved brothers , be stead@@ fast , immovable , always ab@@ ounding in the Lord 's work , because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord .
but with you it may be that I will stay , or even winter , that you may send me on my journey wherever I go .
therefore let no one desp@@ ise him . but set him forward on his journey in peace , that he may come to me ; for I expect him with the brothers .
now I beg you , brothers ( you know the house of Step@@ han@@ as , that it is the first fruits of Ac@@ ha@@ ia , and that they have set themselves to serve the saints ) ,
the assemblies of Asia greet you . Aqu@@ ila and P@@ ris@@ c@@ illa greet you much in the Lord , together with the assembly that is in their house .
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mer@@ cies and God of all comfort ;
who comforts us in all our afflic@@ tion , that we may be able to comfort those who are in any afflic@@ tion , through the comfort with which we ourselves are comfor@@ ted by God .
our hope for you is stead@@ fast , knowing that , since you are part@@ akers of the sufferings , so also are you of the comfort .
who delivered us out of so great a death , and does deliver ; on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us ;
for our bo@@ asting is this : the testimony of our conscience , that in hol@@ iness and sincerity of God , not in fl@@ esh@@ ly wisdom but in the grace of God we behaved ourselves in the world , and more ab@@ und@@ antly toward you .
and by you to pass into Macedonia , and again from Macedonia to come to you , and to be sent forward by you on my journey to Ju@@ dea .
when I therefore was thus determined , did I show fic@@ kl@@ eness ? or the things that I purpose , do I purpose according to the flesh , that with me there should be the " Yes , yes " and the " No , no ? "
for however many are the promises of God , in him is the " Yes . " therefore also through him is the " A@@ men , " to the glory of God through us .
who also sealed us , and gave us the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts .
but if any has caused sorrow , he has caused sorrow , not to me , but in part ( that I not press too heavily ) to you all .
for to this end I also wrote , that I might know the proof of you , whether you are obedient in all things .
now thanks be to God , who always leads us in triumph in Christ , and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place .
to the one a sten@@ ch from death to death ; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life . who is sufficient for these things ?
being revealed that you are a letter of Christ , served by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tablets of stone , but in tablets that are hearts of flesh .
who also made us sufficient as servants of a new covenant ; not of the letter , but of the Spirit . for the letter kills , but the Spirit gives life .
but if the service of death , written engra@@ ved on stones , came with glory , so that the children of Israel could not look stead@@ fast@@ ly on the face of Moses for the glory of his face ; which was passing away :
and not as Moses , who put a veil on his face , that the children of Israel w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t look stead@@ fast@@ ly on the end of that which was passing away .
but their minds were hardened , for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains , because in Christ it passes away .
but we all , with unveiled face be@@ holding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord , are transformed into the same image from glory to glory , even as from the Lord , the Spirit .
but we have ren@@ ounced the hidden things of shame , not walking in craft@@ iness , nor handling the word of God dece@@ it@@ fully ; but by the manifestation of the truth comm@@ ending ourselves to every man 's conscience in the sight of God .
in whom the god of this world has blin@@ ded the minds of the un@@ believing , that the light of the Good News of the glory of Christ , who is the image of God , should not dawn on them .
but we have this treasure in clay vessels , that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God , and not from ourselves .
for we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus ' sake , that the life also of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal flesh .
but having the same spirit of faith , according to that which is written , " I believed , and therefore I spoke . " we also believe , and therefore also we speak ;
for we know that if the earthly house of our tent is dissolved , we have a building from God , a house not made with hands , eternal , in the heavens .
therefore also we make it our aim , whether at home or absent , to be well pleasing to him .
for we must all be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ ; that each one may receive the things in the body , according to what he has done , whether good or bad .
knowing therefore the fear of the Lord , we persuade men , but we are revealed to God ; and I hope that we are revealed also in your consci@@ ences .
for we are not comm@@ ending ourselves to you again , but speak as giving you occasion of bo@@ asting on our behalf , that you may have something to answer those who boast in appearance , and not in heart .
for if we are beside ourselves , it is for God . or if we are of sober mind , it is for you .
he died for all , that those who live should no longer live to themselves , but to him who for their s@@ akes died and rose again .
therefore we know no one after the flesh from now on . even though we have known Christ after the flesh , yet now we know him so no more .
but all things are of God , who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ , and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation ;
namely , that God was in Christ reconc@@ iling the world to himself , not reckoning to them their t@@ resp@@ asses , and having committed to us the word of reconciliation .
for him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf ; so that in him we might become the righteousness of God .
what agreement has a temple of God with idols ? for you are a temple of the living God . even as God said , " I will dwell in them , and walk in them ; and I will be their God , and they will be my people . "
therefore " ' Come out from among them , and be separate , ' says the Lord . ' touch no un@@ clean thing . I will receive you .
I will be to you a Father . you will be to me sons and daughters , ' says the Lord Almighty . "
great is my bold@@ ness of speech toward you . great is my bo@@ asting on your behalf . I am filled with comfort . I over@@ flow with joy in all our afflic@@ tion .
and not by his coming only , but also by the comfort with which he was comfor@@ ted in you , while he told us of your longing , your mourning , and your zeal for me ; so that I rejo@@ iced still more .
for though I made you sorry with my letter , I do not regret it , though I did regret it . for I see that my letter made you sorry , though just for a while .
I now rejoice , not that you were made sorry , but that you were made sorry to repentance . for you were made sorry in a go@@ dly way , that you might suffer loss by us in nothing .
for go@@ dly sorrow works repentance to salvation , which brings no regret . but the sorrow of the world works death .
therefore we have been comfor@@ ted . in our comfort we rejo@@ iced the more exceedingly for the joy of Tit@@ us , because his spirit has been refresh@@ ed by you all .
I speak not by way of commandment , but as proving through the ear@@ nest@@ ness of others the sincerity also of your love .
for you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that , though he was rich , yet for your s@@ akes he became poor , that you through his poverty might become rich .
I give a judgment in this : for this is expedient for you , who were the first to start a year ago , not only to do , but also to be willing .
we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the Good News is known through all the assemblies .
we have sent with them our brother , whom we have many times proved earnest in many things , but now much more earnest , by reason of the great confidence which he has in you .
therefore show the proof of your love to them in front of the assemblies , and of our bo@@ asting on your behalf .
so that I won '@@ t by any means , if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared , we ( to say nothing of you ) should be disappointed in this confident bo@@ asting .
let each man give according as he has determined in his heart ; not grud@@ g@@ ingly , or under compul@@ sion ; for God loves a cheerful gi@@ ver .
seeing that through the proof given by this service , they glori@@ fy God for the obedience of your confession to the Good News of Christ , and for the liber@@ ality of your contribution to them and to all ;
now I Paul , myself , entre@@ at you by the humility and gentl@@ eness of Christ ; I who in your presence am low@@ ly among you , but being absent am bold toward you .
yes , I beg you that I may not , when present , show courage with the confidence with which I intend to be bold against some , who consider us to be walking according to the flesh .
for though we walk in the flesh , we don '@@ t wage war according to the flesh ;
for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh , but mighty before God to the throwing down of strongh@@ olds ,
for we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who comm@@ end themselves . but they themselves , measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves with themselves , are without understanding .
not bo@@ asting beyond proper limits in other men 's lab@@ ors , but having hope that as your faith grows , we will be ab@@ und@@ antly enlarged by you in our sphere of influence ,
for I am jeal@@ ous over you with a go@@ dly jealousy . for I married you to one husband , that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ .
or did I commit a sin in hum@@ bling myself that you might be exalted , because I preached to you God 's Good News free of charge ?
are they He@@ bre@@ ws ? so am I. Are they Israel@@ ites ? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham ? so am I.
are they servants of Christ ? ( I speak as one beside himself ) I am more so ; in lab@@ ors more ab@@ und@@ antly , in prisons more ab@@ und@@ antly , in stri@@ pes above measure , in deaths often .
three times I was beaten with rods . once I was st@@ oned . three times I suffered ship@@ wreck . I have been a night and a day in the deep .
besides those things that are outside , there is that which presses on me daily , anxiety for all the assemblies .
I know a man in Christ , fourteen years ago ( whether in the body , I don '@@ t know , or whether out of the body , I don '@@ t know ; God knows ) , such a one caught up into the third heaven .
I know such a man ( whether in the body , or outside of the body , I don '@@ t know ; God knows ) ,
how he was caught up into Paradise , and heard un@@ spe@@ ak@@ able words , which it is not lawful for a man to utter .
for if I would desire to boast , I will not be foolish ; for I will speak the truth . but I refrain , so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me , or hears from me .
therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses , in injuries , in necessities , in persec@@ utions , in dist@@ resses , for Christ 's sake . for when I am weak , then am I strong .
for what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies , unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you ? forgive me this wrong .
I ex@@ hor@@ ted Tit@@ us , and I sent the brother with him . did Tit@@ us take any advantage of you ? did@@ n '@@ t we walk in the same spirit ? did@@ n '@@ t we walk in the same steps ?
that again when I come my God would humble me before you , and I would mour@@ n for many of those who have sin@@ ned before now , and not rep@@ ented of the un@@ clean@@ ness and sexual im@@ morality and lu@@ st@@ fulness which they committed .
this is the third time I am coming to you . " at the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established . "
for this cause I write these things while absent , that I may not deal sharply when present , according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up , and not for tearing down .
finally , brothers , rejoice . be perf@@ ected , be comfor@@ ted , be of the same mind , live in peace , and the God of love and peace will be with you .
Paul , an apostle ( not from men , neither through man , but through Jesus Christ , and God the Father , who raised him from the dead ) ,
but even though we , or an angel from heaven , should preach to you any " good news " other than that which we preached to you , let him be cur@@ sed .
as we have said before , so I now say again : if any man pre@@ aches to you any " good news " other than that which you received , let him be cur@@ sed .
for am I now seeking the favor of men , or of God ? or am I striving to please men ? for if I were still pleasing men , I w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t be a servant of Christ .
nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me , but I went away into Arabia . then I returned to Damascus .
now about the things which I write to you , behold , before God , I 'm not lying .
( for he who appointed Peter to the apost@@ les@@ hip of the circum@@ cision appointed me also to the Genti@@ les ) ;
and when they perceived the grace that was given to me , James and C@@ ep@@ has and John , they who were re@@ puted to be pillars , gave to me and Bar@@ nab@@ as the right hand of fellowship , that we should go to the Genti@@ les , and they to the circum@@ cision .
for before some people came from James , he ate with the Genti@@ les . but when they came , he drew back and separated himself , fearing those who were of the circum@@ cision .
and the rest of the Jews joined him in his hypocrisy ; so that even Bar@@ nab@@ as was carried away with their hypocrisy .
but if , while we sought to be justified in Christ , we ourselves also were found sinners , is Christ a servant of sin ? certainly not !
I just want to learn this from you . did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law , or by hearing of faith ?
now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident , for , " The righteous will live by faith . "
Christ re@@ deemed us from the curse of the law , having become a curse for us . for it is written , " Cur@@ sed is everyone who hangs on a tree , "
now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed . he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t say , " To seeds , " as of many , but as of one , " To your seed , " which is Christ .
now I say this . a covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ , the law , which came four hundred thirty years after , does not ann@@ ul , so as to make the promise of no effect .
for if the inheritance is of the law , it is no more of promise ; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise .
what then is the law ? it was added because of trans@@ gres@@ sions , until the seed should come to whom the promise has been made . it was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator .
is the law then against the promises of God ? certainly not ! for if there had been a law given which could make alive , most certainly righteousness would have been of the law .
but the Scriptures imprisoned all things under sin , that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe .
but I say that so long as the heir is a child , he is no different from a bond@@ servant , though he is lord of all ;
so we also , when we were children , were held in bond@@ age under the el@@ emental principles of the world .
but now that you have come to know God , or rather to be known by God , why do you turn back again to the weak and miserable el@@ emental principles , to which you desire to be in bond@@ age all over again ?
that which was a temptation to you in my flesh , you did@@ n '@@ t desp@@ ise nor reject ; but you received me as an angel of God , even as Christ Jesus .
they z@@ eal@@ ously seek you in no good way . no , they desire to alien@@ ate you , that you may seek them .
tell me , you that desire to be under the law , don '@@ t you listen to the law ?
however , the son by the hand@@ maid was born according to the flesh , but the son by the free woman was born through promise .
for this Hag@@ ar is Mount Sinai in Arabia , and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now , for she is in bond@@ age with her children .
for it is written , " Re@@ jo@@ ice , you bar@@ ren who don '@@ t bear . break forth and shout , you that don '@@ t trav@@ ail . for more are the children of the des@@ ol@@ ate than of her who has a husband . "
but I , brothers , if I still preach circum@@ cision , why am I still persecuted ? then the stumbling block of the cross has been removed .
for you , brothers , were called for freedom . only don '@@ t use your freedom for gain to the flesh , but through love be servants to one another .
for the whole law is fulfilled in one word , in this : " you shall love your neighbor as yourself . "
for the flesh lu@@ sts against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh ; and these are contrary to one another , that you may not do the things that you desire .
now the works of the flesh are obvious , which are : adul@@ tery , sexual im@@ morality , un@@ clean@@ ness , lu@@ st@@ fulness ,
en@@ vy@@ ings , murders , drun@@ ken@@ ness , or@@ gies , and things like these ; of which I fore@@ warn you , even as I also fore@@ warned you , that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God .
brothers , even if a man is caught in some fault , you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentl@@ eness ; looking to yourself so that you also are@@ n '@@ t tempted .
let us not be weary in doing good , for we will reap in due season , if we don '@@ t give up .
but far be it from me to boast , except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , through which the world has been cruci@@ fied to me , and I to the world .
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ ;
even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world , that we would be holy and without bl@@ emish before him in love ;
in whom we have our redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of our t@@ resp@@ asses , according to the riches of his grace ,
in whom also we were assigned an inheritance , having been fore@@ ordained according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his will ;
who is a pledge of our inheritance , to the redemption of God 's own possession , to the praise of his glory .
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him ;
having the eyes of your hearts enlightened , that you may know what is the hope of his calling , and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints ,
and what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us who believe , according to that working of the strength of his might
far above all rule , and authority , and power , and dom@@ inion , and every name that is named , not only in this age , but also in that which is to come .
he put all things in subj@@ ection under his feet , and gave him to be head over all things for the assembly ,
in which you once walked according to the course of this world , according to the prince of the power of the air , the spirit who now works in the children of disobedience ;
among whom we also all once lived in the lust of our flesh , doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind , and were by nature children of wrath , even as the rest .
even when we were dead through our t@@ resp@@ asses , made us alive together with Christ ( by grace you have been saved ) ,
that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus ;
for by grace you have been saved through faith , and that not of yourselves ; it is the gift of God ,
that you were at that time separate from Christ , alienated from the common@@ wealth of Israel , and strangers from the coven@@ ants of the promise , having no hope and without God in the world .
having abolished in the flesh the hostility , the law of commandments contained in ordin@@ ances , that he might create in himself one new man of the two , making peace ;
by which , when you read , you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ ;
that the Genti@@ les are fellow heirs , and fellow members of the body , and fellow part@@ akers of his promise in Christ Jesus through the Good News ,
and to make all men see what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in God , who created all things through Jesus Christ ;
there is one body , and one Spirit , even as you also were called in one hope of your calling ;
he who descended is the one who also asc@@ ended far above all the heavens , that he might fill all things .
he gave some to be apostles ; and some , prophets ; and some , evangel@@ ists ; and some , shep@@ herds and teachers ;
from whom all the body , being fitted and knit together through that which every joint supplies , according to the working in measure of each individual part , makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love .
and put on the new man , who in the lik@@ eness of God has been created in righteousness and hol@@ iness of truth .
let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth , but such as is good for building up as the need may be , that it may give grace to those who hear .
walk in love , even as Christ also loved you , and gave himself up for us , an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet @@@ -@@ @ sm@@ elling fragrance .
know this for sure , that no sexually immoral person , nor un@@ clean person , nor co@@ vet@@ ous man , who is an id@@ ol@@ ater , has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God .
speaking to one another in p@@ sal@@ ms , hym@@ ns , and spiritual songs ; singing , and making melody in your heart to the Lord ;
for the husband is the head of the wife , and Christ also is the head of the assembly , being himself the s@@ avi@@ or of the body .
even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies . he who loves his own wife loves himself .
servants , be obedient to those who according to the flesh are your masters , with fear and trembling , in sing@@ l@@ eness of your heart , as to Christ ;
with all prayer and requests , praying at all times in the Spirit , and being watch@@ ful to this end in all persever@@ ance and requests for all the saints :
on my behalf , that utter@@ ance may be given to me in opening my mouth , to make known with bold@@ ness the mystery of the Good News ,
for which I am an ambassador in chains ; that in it I may speak boldly , as I ought to speak .
but that you also may know my affairs , how I am doing , Ty@@ ch@@ ic@@ us , the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord , will make known to you all things ;
peace be to the brothers , and love with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
being confident of this very thing , that he who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ .
it is even right for me to think this way on behalf of all of you , because I have you in my heart , because , both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Good News , you all are part@@ akers with me of grace .
and that most of the brothers in the Lord , being confident through my bonds , are more ab@@ und@@ antly bold to speak the word of God without fear .
but the latter out of love , knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the Good News .
what does it matter ? only that in every way , whether in pre@@ tense or in truth , Christ is proclaimed . I rejoice in this , yes , and will rejoice .
for I know that this will turn out to my salvation , through your suppl@@ ication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
having this confidence , I know that I will remain , yes , and remain with you all , for your progress and joy in the faith ,
only let your way of life be worthy of the Good News of Christ , that , whether I come and see you or am absent , I may hear of your state , that you stand firm in one spirit , with one soul striving for the faith of the Good News ;
make my joy full , by being like @@@ -@@ @ minded , having the same love , being of one accord , of one mind ;
therefore God also highly exalted him , and gave to him the name which is above every name ;
for it is God who works in you both to will and to work , for his good pleasure .
that you may become bl@@ am@@ eless and harmless , children of God without bl@@ emish in the midst of a cro@@ oked and perverse generation , among whom you are seen as lights in the world ,
yes , and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith , I rejoice , and rejoice with you all .
but I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon , that I also may be che@@ ered up when I know how you are doing .
for indeed he was sick , nearly to death , but God had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , that I might not have sorrow on sorrow .
I have sent him therefore the more dilig@@ ently , that , when you see him again , you may rejoice , and that I may be the less sor@@ row@@ ful .
because for the work of Christ he came near to death , risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me .
finally , my brothers , rejoice in the Lord . to write the same things to you , to me indeed is not ti@@ res@@ ome , but for you it is safe .
for we are the circum@@ cision , who worship God in the Spirit , and rejoice in Christ Jesus , and have no confidence in the flesh ;
though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh . if any other man thinks that he has confidence in the flesh , I yet more :
circum@@ c@@ ised the eighth day , of the stock of Israel , of the tribe of Benjamin , a Hebrew of He@@ bre@@ ws ; concerning the law , a Pharis@@ ee ;
and be found in him , not having a righteousness of my own , that which is of the law , but that which is through faith in Christ , the righteousness which is from God by faith ;
that I may know him , and the power of his resurrection , and the fellowship of his sufferings , becoming con@@ formed to his death ;
who will change the body of our humiliation to be con@@ formed to the body of his glory , according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself .
yes , I beg you also , true yo@@ ke@@ fellow , help these women , for they lab@@ ored with me in the Good News , with Cl@@ ement also , and the rest of my fellow workers , whose names are in the book of life .
but I rejoice in the Lord greatly , that now at length you have revived your thought for me ; in which you did indeed take thought , but you lacked opportunity .
I know how to be hum@@ bled , and I know also how to abound . in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry , both to abound and to be in need .
you yourselves also know , you Philip@@ pi@@ ans , that in the beginning of the Good News , when I departed from Macedonia , no assembly shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you only .
we give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , praying always for you ,
having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus , and of the love which you have toward all the saints ,
for this cause , we also , since the day we heard this , don '@@ t cease praying and making requests for you , that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding ,
that you may walk worth@@ ily of the Lord , to please him in all respects , bearing fruit in every good work , and increasing in the knowledge of God ;
giving thanks to the Father , who made us fit to be part@@ akers of the inheritance of the saints in light ;
for by him all things were created , in the heavens and on the earth , things visible and things invisible , whether thr@@ ones or dom@@ ini@@ ons or princip@@ alities or powers ; all things have been created through him , and for him .
the mystery which has been hidden for ages and generations . but now it has been revealed to his saints ,
to whom God was pleased to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Genti@@ les , which is Christ in you , the hope of glory ;
for though I am absent in the flesh , yet am I with you in the spirit , rejo@@ icing and seeing your order , and the stead@@ fast@@ ness of your faith in Christ .
be careful that you don '@@ t let anyone rob you through his philosophy and vain dece@@ it , after the tradition of men , after the elements of the world , and not after Christ .
having been buried with him in baptism , in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God , who raised him from the dead .
let no one rob you of your prize by a voluntary humility and wor@@ shipping of the angels , dwelling in the things which he has not seen , v@@ ain@@ ly pu@@ ffed up by his fl@@ esh@@ ly mind ,
and not holding firmly to the Head , from whom all the body , being supplied and knit together through the joints and lig@@ aments , grows with God 's growth .
put to death therefore your members which are on the earth : sexual im@@ morality , un@@ clean@@ ness , de@@ pra@@ ved passion , evil desire , and co@@ vet@@ ousness , which is id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry ;
but now you also put them all away : anger , wrath , mal@@ ice , slan@@ der , and shameful speaking out of your mouth .
and have put on the new man , who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator ,
put on therefore , as God 's chosen ones , holy and beloved , a heart of compassion , kindness , low@@ liness , humility , and persever@@ ance ;
bearing with one another , and for@@ giving each other , if any man has a complaint against any ; even as Christ for@@ gave you , so you also do .
servants , obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh , not just when they are looking , as men pleas@@ ers , but in sing@@ l@@ eness of heart , fearing God .
but he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done , and there is no partiality .
praying together for us also , that God may open to us a door for the word , to speak the mystery of Christ , for which I am also in bonds ;
let your speech always be with grace , seas@@ oned with salt , that you may know how you ought to answer each one .
together with One@@ sim@@ us , the faithful and beloved brother , who is one of you . they will make known to you everything that is going on here .
Ep@@ aphr@@ as , who is one of you , a servant of Christ , sal@@ utes you , always striving for you in his prayers , that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God .
tell Archi@@ pp@@ us , " Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord , that you fulfill it . "
Paul , Sil@@ van@@ us , and Timothy , to the assembly of the Thess@@ al@@ onians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ : grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
remembering without c@@ easing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ , before our God and Father .
and that our Good News came to you not in word only , but also in power , and in the Holy Spirit , and with much assurance . you know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be among you for your sake .
you became im@@ it@@ ators of us , and of the Lord , having received the word in much afflic@@ tion , with joy of the Holy Spirit ,
but having suffered before and been sham@@ efully treated , as you know , at Philipp@@ i , we grew bold in our God to tell you the Good News of God in much conflict .
even so , aff@@ ection@@ ately longing for you , we were well pleased to im@@ part to you , not the Good News of God only , but also our own souls , because you had become very dear to us .
for you remember , brothers , our labor and trav@@ ail ; for working night and day , that we might not burden any of you , we preached to you the Good News of God .
for you , brothers , became im@@ it@@ ators of the assemblies of God which are in Ju@@ dea in Christ Jesus ; for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen , even as they did from the Jews ;
who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets , and drove us out , and did@@ n '@@ t please God , and are contrary to all men ;
but when Timothy came just now to us from you , and brought us glad news of your faith and love , and that you have good memories of us always , longing to see us , even as we also long to see you ;
and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we also do toward you ,
finally then , brothers , we beg and ex@@ h@@ ort you in the Lord Jesus , that as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God , that you abound more and more .
therefore he who rejects this do@@ es@@ n '@@ t reject man , but God , who has also given his Holy Spirit to you .
but concerning bro@@ ther@@ ly love , you have no need that one write to you . for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another ,
for indeed you do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia . but we ex@@ h@@ ort you , brothers , that you abound more and more ;
and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life , and to do your own business , and to work with your own hands , even as we instructed you ;
that you may walk properly toward those who are outside , and may have need of nothing .
but we don '@@ t want you to be ignorant , brothers , concerning those who have fallen asleep , so that you don '@@ t gri@@ eve like the rest , who have no hope .
for the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the ar@@ chang@@ el , and with God 's trum@@ pet . the dead in Christ will rise first ,
then we who are alive , who are left , will be caught up together with them in the clouds , to meet the Lord in the air . so we will be with the Lord forever .
you are all children of light , and children of the day . we don '@@ t belong to the night , nor to darkness ,
but we beg you , brothers , to know those who labor among you , and are over you in the Lord , and admon@@ ish you ,
see that no one returns evil for evil to anyone , but always follow after that which is good , for one another , and for all .
Paul , Sil@@ van@@ us , and Timothy , to the assembly of the Thess@@ al@@ onians in God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ :
we are bound to always give thanks to God for you , brothers , even as it is appropriate , because your faith grows exceedingly , and the love of each and every one of you towards one another ab@@ ounds ;
so that we ourselves boast about you in the assemblies of God for your patience and faith in all your persec@@ utions and in the afflic@@ tions which you endure .
and to give relief to you who are afflicted with us , when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in fl@@ aming fire ,
giving vengeance to those who don '@@ t know God , and to those who don '@@ t obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus ,
who will pay the penalty : eternal destruction from the face of the Lord and from the glory of his might ,
when he comes to be glori@@ fied in his saints , and to be admired among all those who have believed ( because our testimony to you was believed ) in that day .
to this end we also pray always for you , that our God may count you worthy of your calling , and fulfill every desire of goodness and work of faith , with power ;
now , brothers , concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , and our gathering together to him , we ask you
not to be quickly shaken in your mind , nor yet be troubled , either by spirit , or by word , or by letter as from us , saying that the day of Christ had come .
let no one deceive you in any way . for it will not be , unless the departure comes first , and the man of sin is revealed , the son of destruction ,
he who opposes and exal@@ ts himself against all that is called God or that is worshi@@ ped ; so that he sits as God in the temple of God , setting himself up as God .
now you know what is restr@@ aining him , to the end that he may be revealed in his own season .
that they all might be judged who did@@ n '@@ t believe the truth , but had pleasure in un@@ righteousness .
but we are bound to always give thanks to God for you , brothers loved by the Lord , because God chose you from the beginning for salvation through sanc@@ tification of the Spirit and belief in the truth ;
to which he called you through our Good News , for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
so then , brothers , stand firm , and hold the traditions which you were taught by us , whether by word , or by letter .
finally , brothers , pray for us , that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be glori@@ fied , even as also with you ;
now we command you , brothers , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that you withdraw yourselves from every brother who walks in rebellion , and not after the tradition which they received from us .
neither did we eat bread from anyone 's hand without paying for it , but in labor and trav@@ ail worked night and day , that we might not burden any of you ;
for we hear of some who walk among you in rebellion , who don '@@ t work at all , but are bus@@ y@@ bodies .
now those who are that way , we command and ex@@ h@@ ort in the Lord Jesus Christ , that with qui@@ et@@ ness they work , and eat their own bread .
if any man do@@ es@@ n '@@ t obey our word in this letter , note that man , that you have no company with him , to the end that he may be ashamed .
now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways . the Lord be with you all .
as I urged you when I was going into Macedonia , stay at E@@ ph@@ es@@ us that you might command certain men not to teach a different doctrine ,
but the goal of this command is love , out of a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith ;
as knowing this , that law is not made for a righteous man , but for the law@@ less and in@@ subordinate , for the un@@ go@@ dly and sinners , for the un@@ holy and prof@@ ane , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , for man@@ s@@ layers ,
the saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance , that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners ; of whom I am chief .
however , for this cause I obtained mercy , that in me first , Jesus Christ might display all his patience , for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life .
of whom is Hy@@ men@@ a@@ eus and Alexander ; whom I delivered to Satan , that they might be taught not to bl@@ asph@@ eme .
to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle ( I am telling the truth in Christ , not lying ) , a teacher of the Genti@@ les in faith and truth .
but I don '@@ t permit a woman to teach , nor to exercise authority over a man , but to be in qui@@ et@@ ness .
but she will be saved through her child@@ bearing , if they continue in faith , love , and sanc@@ tification with so@@ bri@@ ety .
moreover he must have good testimony from those who are outside , to avoid falling into repro@@ ach and the sn@@ are of the devil .
but if I wait long , that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in God 's house , which is the assembly of the living God , the pillar and ground of the truth .
without controversy , the mystery of god@@ liness is great : God was revealed in the flesh , justified in the spirit , seen by angels , preached among the nations , believed on in the world , and received up in glory .
but the Spirit says expressly that in later times some will fall away from the faith , paying attention to seduc@@ ing spirits and doctrines of demons ,
for every creature of God is good , and nothing is to be rejected , if it is received with thank@@ s@@ giving .
for to this end we both labor and suffer repro@@ ach , because we have set our trust in the living God , who is the Savior of all men , especially of those who believe .
let no man desp@@ ise your youth ; but be an example to those who believe , in word , in your way of life , in love , in spirit , in faith , and in purity .
pay attention to yourself , and to your teaching . continue in these things , for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you .
but if any widow has children or grandchildren , let them learn first to show pi@@ ety towards their own family , and to repay their parents , for this is acceptable in the sight of God .
but if anyone do@@ es@@ n '@@ t provide for his own , and especially his own household , he has denied the faith , and is worse than an un@@ believer .
let no one be enrolled as a widow under sixty years old , having been the wife of one man ,
if any man or woman who believes has wid@@ ows , let them relieve them , and don '@@ t let the assembly be burdened ; that it might relieve those who are wid@@ ows indeed .
let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor , especially those who labor in the word and in teaching .
I command you in the sight of God , and Christ Jesus , and the chosen angels , that you observe these things without prejudice , doing nothing by partiality .
let as many as are bond@@ servants under the y@@ oke count their own masters worthy of all honor , that the name of God and the doctrine not be bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed .
constant friction of people of corrupt minds and des@@ tit@@ ute of the truth , who suppose that god@@ liness is a means of gain . withdraw yourself from such .
but those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a sn@@ are and many foolish and harmful lu@@ sts , such as d@@ rown men in ruin and destruction .
fight the good fight of faith . lay hold of the eternal life to which you were called , and you confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses .
I command you before God , who gives life to all things , and before Christ Jesus , who before Pon@@ ti@@ us Pil@@ ate testified the good confession ,
charge those who are rich in this present world that they not be ha@@ u@@ ghty , nor have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches , but on the living God , who rich@@ ly provides us with everything to enjoy ;
I thank God , whom I serve as my fore@@ fathers did , with a pure conscience . how unc@@ easing is my memory of you in my peti@@ tions , night and day
having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you ; which lived first in your grandmother Lo@@ is , and your mother E@@ un@@ ice , and , I am persuaded , in you also .
for God did@@ n '@@ t give us a spirit of fear , but of power , love , and self @@@ -@@ @ control .
therefore don '@@ t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord , nor of me his prisoner ; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God ,
who saved us and called us with a holy calling , not according to our works , but according to his own purpose and grace , which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal ,
for this cause I also suffer these things . yet I am not ashamed , for I know him whom I have believed , and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day .
this you know , that all who are in Asia turned away from me ; of whom are Phy@@ g@@ el@@ us and Her@@ mo@@ genes .
( the Lord grant to him to find the Lord 's mercy in that day ) ; and in how many things he served at E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , you know very well .
the things which you have heard from me among many witnesses , commit the same to faithful men , who will be able to teach others also .
also , if anyone compet@@ es in athletics , he is@@ n '@@ t crowned unless he has competed by the rules .
therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones ' sake , that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory .
however God 's firm foundation stands , having this seal , " The Lord knows those who are his , " and , " Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from un@@ righteousness . "
if anyone therefore pur@@ ges himself from these , he will be a vessel for honor , sancti@@ fied , and suitable for the master 's use , prepared for every good work .
flee from youthful lu@@ sts ; but pursue righteousness , faith , love , and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart .
for some of these are people who cre@@ ep into houses , and take captive gul@@ li@@ ble women loaded down with sins , led away by various lu@@ sts ,
even as J@@ ann@@ es and J@@ amb@@ res opposed Moses , so do these also oppose the truth ; men corrupted in mind , who concerning the faith , are rejected .
persec@@ utions , and sufferings : those things that happened to me at Anti@@ o@@ ch , I@@ con@@ ium , and Ly@@ stra . I endured those persec@@ utions . out of them all the Lord delivered me .
from infancy , you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith , which is in Christ Jesus .
for the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine , but , having it@@ ching ears , will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lu@@ sts ;
from now on , there is stored up for me the crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous judge , will give to me on that day ; and not to me only , but also to all those who have loved his appearing .
Alexander , the cop@@ pers@@ mith , did much evil to me . the Lord will repay him according to his works ,
and the Lord will deliver me from every evil work , and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom ; to whom be the glory forever and ever . A@@ men .
to Tit@@ us , my true child according to a common faith : grace , mercy , and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior .
I left you in Crete for this reason , that you would set in order the things that were lacking , and appoint elders in every city , as I directed you ;
if anyone is bl@@ am@@ eless , the husband of one wife , having children who believe , who are not accused of loose or un@@ ru@@ ly behavior .
for the over@@ se@@ er must be bl@@ am@@ eless , as God 's ste@@ ward ; not self @@@ -@@ @ pleasing , not easily ang@@ ered , not given to wine , not violent , not greedy for dishonest gain ;
but given to hospitality , a lover of good , sober minded , fair , holy , self @@@ -@@ @ controlled ;
whose mouths must be stopped ; men who overthrow whole houses , teaching things which they ought not , for dishonest gain 's sake .
one of them , a prophet of their own , said , " C@@ ret@@ ans are always li@@ ars , evil beasts , and idle glut@@ tons . "
and that older women likewise be rever@@ ent in behavior , not slan@@ der@@ ers nor enslav@@ ed to much wine , teachers of that which is good ;
to be sober minded , cha@@ ste , workers at home , kind , being in subj@@ ection to their own husbands , that God 's word may not be bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed .
instruc@@ ting us to the intent that , denying un@@ god@@ liness and worldly lu@@ sts , we would live so@@ ber@@ ly , righte@@ ously , and go@@ dly in this present world ;
looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior , Jesus Christ ;
who gave himself for us , that he might re@@ deem us from all ini@@ qu@@ ity , and puri@@ fy for himself a people for his own possession , z@@ eal@@ ous for good works .
not by works of righteousness , which we did ourselves , but according to his mercy , he saved us , through the washing of regeneration and renew@@ ing by the Holy Spirit ,
that , being justified by his grace , we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life .
this saying is faithful , and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently , so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works . these things are good and profitable to men ;
when I send Ar@@ tem@@ as to you , or Ty@@ ch@@ ic@@ us , be dilig@@ ent to come to me to Nic@@ opol@@ is , for I have determined to winter there .
I beg you for my child , whom I have become the father of in my chains , One@@ sim@@ us ,
whom I desired to keep with me , that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News .
but I was willing to do nothing without your consent , that your goodness would not be as of necessity , but of free will .
no longer as a slave , but more than a slave , a beloved brother , especially to me , but how much rather to you , both in the flesh and in the Lord .
I , Paul , write this with my own hand : I will repay it ( not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides ) .
has at the end of these days spoken to us by his Son , whom he appointed heir of all things , through whom also he made the worlds .
again , when he brings in the fir@@ st@@ born into the world he says , " Let all the angels of God worship him . "
of the angels he says , " Who makes his angels winds , and his servants a flame of fire . "
but of the Son he says , " Your throne , O God , is forever and ever . the scep@@ ter of upri@@ ghtness is the scep@@ ter of your Kingdom .
you have loved righteousness , and hated ini@@ qu@@ ity ; therefore God , your God , has ano@@ inted you with the oil of gl@@ ad@@ ness above your fellows . "
and , " You , Lord , in the beginning , laid the foundation of the earth . the heavens are the works of your hands .
as a mantle , you will roll them up , and they will be changed ; but you are the same . your years will not fail . "
how will we escape if we neglect so great a salv@@ ation@@ -@@ -@@ which at the first having been spoken through the Lord , was confirmed to us by those who heard ;
for he did@@ n '@@ t subject the world to come , of which we speak , to angels .
but one has somewhere testified , saying , " What is man , that you think of him ? or the son of man , that you care for him ?
you have put all things in subj@@ ection under his feet . " for in that he subjected all things to him , he left nothing that is not subject to him . but now we don '@@ t see all things subjected to him , yet .
but we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels , Jesus , because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor , that by the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone .
for it became him , for whom are all things , and through whom are all things , in bringing many children to glory , to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
for both he who sancti@@ fies and those who are sancti@@ fied are all from one , for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brothers ,
again , " I will put my trust in him . " again , " Be@@ hold , here I am with the children whom God has given me . "
Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant , for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken ,
therefore I was dis@@ pleased with that generation , and said , ' They always er@@ r in their heart , but they did@@ n '@@ t know my ways ; '
but ex@@ h@@ ort one another day by day , so long as it is called " today " ; lest any one of you be hardened by the dece@@ it@@ fulness of sin .
for we have become part@@ akers of Christ , if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm to the end :
for we who have believed do enter into that rest , even as he has said , " As I s@@ wore in my wrath , they will not enter into my rest " ; although the works were finished from the foundation of the world .
there is no creature that is hidden from his sight , but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
for we don '@@ t have a high priest who can '@@ t be touched with the feeling of our in@@ firm@@ ities , but one who has been in all points tempted like we are , yet without sin .
for every high priest , being taken from among men , is appointed for men in things pertaining to God , that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins .
so also Christ did@@ n '@@ t glori@@ fy himself to be made a high priest , but it was he who said to him , " You are my Son . today I have become your father . "
he , in the days of his flesh , having offered up prayers and peti@@ tions with strong crying and tears to him who was able to save him from death , and having been heard for his go@@ dly fear ,
for although by this time you should be teachers , you again need to have someone teach you the ru@@ di@@ ments of the first principles of the or@@ acles of God . you have come to need milk , and not solid food .
for everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of righteousness , for he is a baby .
therefore leaving the teaching of the first principles of Christ , let us press on to perfec@@ tion@@ -@@ -@@ not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works , of faith toward God ,
of the teaching of bap@@ tis@@ ms , of laying on of hands , of resurrection of the dead , and of eternal judgment .
for the land which has drunk the rain that comes often on it , and brings forth a crop suitable for them for whose sake it is also til@@ led , receives blessing from God ;
but if it bears thor@@ ns and th@@ ist@@ les , it is rejected and near being cur@@ sed , whose end is to be burned .
for God is not un@@ righteous , so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you showed toward his name , in that you served the saints , and still do serve them .
this hope we have as an anchor of the soul , a hope both sure and stead@@ fast and entering into that which is within the veil ;
for this Mel@@ ch@@ iz@@ e@@ de@@ k , king of Sal@@ em , priest of God Most High , who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him ,
without father , without mother , without gen@@ eal@@ ogy , having neither beginning of days nor end of life , but made like the Son of God ) , remains a priest continually .
now consider how great this man was , to whom even Abraham , the patri@@ arch , gave a tenth out of the best spo@@ ils .
but he whose gen@@ eal@@ ogy is not counted from them has accepted ti@@ thes from Abraham , and has blessed him who has the promises .
( for the law made nothing perfect ) , and a bringing in of a better hope , through which we draw near to God .
therefore he is also able to save to the utter@@ most those who draw near to God through him , seeing that he lives forever to make interc@@ ession for them .
who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t need , like those high priests , to offer up sacrifices daily , first for his own sins , and then for the sins of the people . for he did this once for all , when he offered up himself .
for the law ap@@ points men as high priests who have weakness , but the word of the oath which came after the law ap@@ points a Son forever who has been perf@@ ected .
for finding fault with them , he said , " Be@@ hold , the days come , " says the Lord , " that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Jud@@ ah ;
they will not teach every man his fellow citizen , and every man his brother , saying , ' Know the Lord , ' for all will know me , from their least to their greatest .
but into the second the high priest alone , once in the year , not without blood , which he offers for himself , and for the errors of the people .
the Holy Spirit is indicating this , that the way into the Holy Place was@@ n '@@ t yet revealed while the first tab@@ ern@@ acle was still standing ;
which is a symbol of the present age , where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are incapable , concerning the conscience , of making the wor@@ ship@@ per perfect ;
nor yet through the blood of goats and cal@@ ves , but through his own blood , entered in once for all into the Holy Place , having obtained eternal redemption .
for if the blood of goats and bul@@ ls , and the ashes of a hei@@ fer sprink@@ ling those who have been de@@ filed , sancti@@ fy to the clean@@ ness of the flesh :
for this reason he is the mediator of a new covenant , since a death has occurred for the redemption of the trans@@ gres@@ sions that were under the first covenant , that those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance .
for when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of the cal@@ ves and the goats , with water and scar@@ let wool and h@@ ys@@ so@@ p , and sprink@@ led both the book itself and all the people ,
for Christ h@@ as@@ n '@@ t entered into holy places made with hands , which are representations of the true , but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us ;
nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own ,
for the law , having a shadow of the good to come , not the very image of the things , can never with the same sacrifices year by year , which they offer continually , make perfect those who draw near .
or else w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t they have ceased to be offered , because the worshi@@ ppers , having been once cleans@@ ed , would have had no more consciousness of sins ?
therefore when he comes into the world , he says , " Sac@@ ri@@ fice and offering you did@@ n '@@ t desire , but you prepared a body for me ;
then I said , ' Be@@ hold , I have come ( in the scroll of the book it is written of me ) to do your will , O God . ' "
let 's draw near with a true heart in full@@ ness of faith , having our hearts sprink@@ led from an evil conscience , and having our body washed with pure water ,
but a certain fearful expectation of judgment , and a fierc@@ eness of fire which will dev@@ our the adversaries .
for we know him who said , " Ven@@ ge@@ ance belongs to me , " says the Lord , " I will repay . " again , " The Lord will judge his people . "
but remember the former days , in which , after you were enlightened , you endured a great struggle with sufferings ;
for you both had compassion on me in my chains , and joy@@ fully accepted the pl@@ undering of your possessions , knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens .
by faith , A@@ bel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than C@@ ain , through which he had testimony given to him that he was righteous , God testi@@ fying with respect to his gifts ; and through it he , being dead , still speaks .
by faith , E@@ no@@ ch was taken away , so that he w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t see death , and he was not found , because God translated him . for he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had been well pleasing to God .
without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him , for he who comes to God must believe that he exists , and that he is a re@@ war@@ der of those who seek him .
by faith , Noah , being warned about things not yet seen , moved with go@@ dly fear , prepared a ship for the saving of his house , through which he condemned the world , and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith .
therefore as many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore , were fa@@ ther@@ ed by one man , and him as good as dead .
but now they desire a better country , that is , a heavenly one . therefore God is not ashamed of them , to be called their God , for he has prepared a city for them .
concluding that God is able to raise up even from the dead . figur@@ atively speaking , he also did receive him back from the dead .
by faith , they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land . when the Egyptians tried to do so , they were swallowed up .
qu@@ en@@ ched the power of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , from weakness were made strong , grew mighty in war , and caused foreign armies to flee .
they were st@@ oned . they were s@@ awn apart . they were tempted . they were sl@@ ain with the sword . they went around in sheep skins and in goat skins ; being des@@ tit@@ ute , afflicted , ill @@@ -@@ @ treated
for consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself , that you don '@@ t grow weary , fain@@ ting in your souls .
and you have forgotten the ex@@ hor@@ tation which reasons with you as with children , " My son , don '@@ t take lightly the cha@@ st@@ ening of the Lord , nor faint when you are re@@ proved by him ;
furthermore , we had the fathers of our flesh to cha@@ sten us , and we paid them respect . shall we not much rather be in subj@@ ection to the Father of spirits , and live ?
for they indeed , for a few days , punished us as seemed good to them ; but he for our profit , that we may be part@@ akers of his hol@@ iness .
all cha@@ st@@ ening seems for the present to be not joy@@ ous but griev@@ ous ; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby .
looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God ; lest any root of bitterness spr@@ inging up trouble you , and many be de@@ filed by it ;
for you know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing , he was rejected , for he found no place for a change of mind though he sought it dilig@@ ently with tears .
for you have not come to a mountain that might be touched , and that burned with fire , and to black@@ ness , darkness , storm ,
the sound of a trum@@ pet , and the voice of words ; which those who heard it beg@@ ged that not one more word should be spoken to them ,
but you have come to Mount Z@@ ion , and to the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , and to innumerable multi@@ tudes of angels ,
to the general assembly and assembly of the fir@@ st@@ born who are enrolled in heaven , to God the Judge of all , to the spirits of just men made perfect ,
to Jesus , the mediator of a new covenant , and to the blood of sprink@@ ling that speaks better than that of A@@ bel .
see that you don '@@ t refuse him who speaks . for if they did@@ n '@@ t escape when they refused him who warned on the earth , how much more will we not escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven ,
whose voice shook the earth then , but now he has promised , saying , " Y@@ et once more I will shake not only the earth , but also the heavens . "
therefore , receiving a Kingdom that can '@@ t be shaken , let us have grace , through which we serve God accept@@ ably , with reverence and awe ,
Don '@@ t forget to show hospitality to strangers , for in doing so , some have entertained angels without knowing it .
so that with good courage we say , " The Lord is my hel@@ per . I will not fear . what can man do to me ? "
we have an altar from which those who serve the holy tab@@ ern@@ acle have no right to eat .
therefore Jesus also , that he might sancti@@ fy the people through his own blood , suffered outside of the gate .
obey your leaders and submit to them , for they watch on behalf of your souls , as those who will give account , that they may do this with joy , and not with gro@@ aning , for that would be unprofitable for you .
now may the God of peace , who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant , our Lord Jesus ,
make you complete in every good work to do his will , working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ , to whom be the glory forever and ever . A@@ men .
James , a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , to the twelve tribes which are in the Dis@@ per@@ sion : greetings .
but let him ask in faith , without any doub@@ ting , for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea , driven by the wind and tos@@ sed .
and the rich , in that he is made humble , because like the flower in the grass , he will pass away .
blessed is the man who endu@@ res temptation , for when he has been approved , he will receive the crown of life , which the Lord promised to those who love him .
every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , coming down from the Father of lights , with whom can be no variation , nor turning shadow .
therefore , putting away all fil@@ thiness and over@@ flowing of w@@ ick@@ edness , receive with humility the im@@ planted word , which is able to save your souls .
for if anyone is a he@@ arer of the word and not a do@@ er , he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror ;
for he sees himself , and goes away , and immediately for@@ gets what kind of man he was .
but he who looks into the perfect law of freedom , and continues , not being a he@@ arer who for@@ gets , but a do@@ er of the work , this man will be blessed in what he does .
and you pay special attention to him who wears the fine clothing , and say , " S@@ it here in a good place " ; and you tell the poor man , " Stand there , " or " S@@ it by my foot@@ stool " ;
listen , my beloved brothers . did@@ n '@@ t God choose those who are poor in this world to be rich in faith , and heirs of the Kingdom which he promised to those who love him ?
however , if you fulfill the royal law , according to the Scripture , " You shall love your neighbor as yourself , " you do well .
for he who said , " Do not commit adul@@ tery , " also said , " Do not commit murder . " now if you do not commit adul@@ tery , but murder , you have become a trans@@ gres@@ sor of the law .
so speak , and so do , as men who are to be judged by a law of freedom .
and one of you tells them , " Go in peace , be war@@ med and filled " ; and yet you did@@ n '@@ t give them the things the body needs , what good is it ?
and the Scripture was fulfilled which says , " Abraham believed God , and it was accounted to him as righteousness " ; and he was called the friend of God .
for in many things we all stum@@ ble . if anyone do@@ es@@ n '@@ t stum@@ ble in word , the same is a perfect man , able to bri@@ dle the whole body also .
behold , the ships also , though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds , are yet guided by a very small rud@@ der , wherever the pilot desires .
so the tongue is also a little member , and boasts great things . see how a small fire can spread to a large forest !
and the tongue is a fire . the world of ini@@ qu@@ ity among our members is the tongue , which de@@ files the whole body , and sets on fire the course of nature , and is set on fire by Ge@@ hen@@ na .
who is wise and understanding among you ? let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentl@@ eness of wisdom .
you adul@@ ter@@ ers and adul@@ ter@@ esses , don '@@ t you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God ? whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God .
but he gives more grace . therefore it says , " God resi@@ sts the proud , but gives grace to the humble . "
be subject therefore to God . but resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
Don '@@ t speak against one another , brothers . he who speaks against a brother and judges his brother , speaks against the law and judges the law . but if you judge the law , you are not a do@@ er of the law , but a judge .
whereas you don '@@ t know what your life will be like tomorrow . for what is your life ? for you are a vapor , that appears for a little time , and then van@@ ishes away .
your gold and your silver are corro@@ ded , and their corrosion will be for a testimony against you , and will eat your flesh like fire . you have laid up your treasure in the last days .
be patient therefore , brothers , until the coming of the Lord . behold , the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth , being patient over it , until it receives the early and late rain .
you also be patient . establish your hearts , for the coming of the Lord is at hand .
Don '@@ t gr@@ um@@ ble , brothers , against one another , so that you won '@@ t be judged . behold , the judge stands at the door .
take , brothers , for an example of suffering and of patience , the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord .
behold , we call them blessed who endured . you have heard of the patience of Job , and have seen the Lord in the outcome , and how the Lord is full of compassion and mercy .
is any among you sick ? let him call for the elders of the assembly , and let them pray over him , ano@@ in@@ ting him with oil in the name of the Lord ,
confess your offenses to one another , and pray for one another , that you may be healed . the insist@@ ent prayer of a righteous person is power@@ fully effective .

searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ , which was in them , pointed to , when he predicted the sufferings of Christ , and the gl@@ ories that would follow them .
knowing that you were re@@ deemed , not with corrup@@ tible things , with silver or gold , from the useless way of life handed down from your fathers ,
who through him are believers in God , who raised him from the dead , and gave him glory ; so that your faith and hope might be in God .
seeing you have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth through the Spirit in sincere bro@@ ther@@ ly affection , love one another from the heart ferv@@ ently :
for , " All flesh is like grass , and all of man 's glory like the flower in the grass . the grass with@@ ers , and its flower falls ;
but the Lord 's word endu@@ res forever . " this is the word of Good News which was preached to you .
you also , as living stones , are built up as a spiritual house , to be a holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to God through Jesus Christ .
because it is contained in Scripture , " Be@@ hold , I lay in Z@@ ion a chief cornerstone , chosen , and precious : he who believes in him will not be disappointed . "
but you are a chosen race , a royal priesthood , a holy nation , a people for God 's own possession , that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light :
having good behavior among the nations , so in that of which they speak against you as ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers , they may by your good works , which they see , glori@@ fy God in the day of vis@@ itation .
servants , be in subj@@ ection to your masters with all fear ; not only to the good and gentle , but also to the wicked .
for what glory is it if , when you sin , you patiently endure beating ? but if , when you do well , you patiently endure suffering , this is comm@@ end@@ able with God .
who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree , that we , having died to sins , might live to righteousness ; by whose stri@@ pes you were healed .
for this is how the holy women before , who hoped in God also ador@@ ned themselves , being in subj@@ ection to their own husbands :
as Sarah obeyed Abraham , calling him lord , whose children you now are , if you do well , and are not put in fear by any terror .
you husbands , in the same way , live with your wives according to knowledge , giving honor to the woman , as to the weaker vessel , as being also joint heirs of the grace of life ; that your prayers may not be hindered .
for , " He who would love life , and see good days , let him keep his tongue from evil , and his lips from speaking dece@@ it .
but even if you should suffer for righteousness ' sake , you are blessed . " Don '@@ t fear what they fear , neither be troubled . "
but sancti@@ fy the Lord God in your hearts ; and always be ready to give an answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in you , with humility and fear :
for it is better , if it is God 's will , that you suffer for doing well than for doing evil .
because Christ also suffered for sins once , the righteous for the un@@ righteous , that he might bring you to God ; being put to death in the flesh , but made alive in the spirit ;
who before were dis@@ obedient , when God waited patiently in the days of Noah , while the ship was being built . in it , few , that is , eight souls , were saved through water .
who is at the right hand of God , having gone into heaven , angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him .
for@@ as@@ much then as Christ suffered for us in the flesh , arm yourselves also with the same mind ; for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin ;
as each has received a gift , employ it in serving one another , as good managers of the grace of God in its various forms .
but because you are part@@ akers of Christ 's sufferings , rejoice ; that at the revelation of his glory you also may rejoice with exceeding joy .
if you are insul@@ ted for the name of Christ , you are blessed ; because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you . on their part he is bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed , but on your part he is glori@@ fied .
for let none of you suffer as a murderer , or a thief , or an evil do@@ er , or a med@@ d@@ ler in other men 's matters .
therefore let them also who suffer according to the will of God in doing good entr@@ ust their souls to him , as to a faithful Creator .
neither as l@@ ording it over those entrusted to you , but making yourselves examples to the flock .
be sober and self @@@ -@@ @ controlled . be watch@@ ful . your adversary , the devil , walks around like a ro@@ aring lion , seeking whom he may dev@@ our .
she who is in Babylon , chosen together with you , gre@@ ets you ; and so does Mark , my son .
greet one another with a kiss of love . peace be to you all who are in Christ Jesus . A@@ men .
Simon Peter , a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ , to those who have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior , Jesus Christ :
seeing that his divine power has granted to us all things that per@@ tain to life and god@@ liness , through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and virtue ;
yes , and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence , in your faith supply moral excellence ; and in moral excellence , knowledge ;
therefore , brothers , be more dilig@@ ent to make your calling and election sure . for if you do these things , you will never stum@@ ble .
for thus you will be rich@@ ly supplied with the entrance into the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Savior , Jesus Christ .
I think it right , as long as I am in this tent , to stir you up by reminding you ;
yes , I will make every effort that you may always be able to remember these things even after my departure .
for we did not follow c@@ un@@ n@@ ingly devised f@@ ables , when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but we were eye@@ witnesses of his maj@@ esty .
for he received from God the Father honor and glory , when the voice came to him from the Maj@@ estic Glory , " This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased . "
but false prophets also arose among the people , as false teachers will also be among you , who will secretly bring in destructive here@@ sies , denying even the Master who bought them , bringing on themselves swift destruction .
many will follow their immoral ways , and as a result , the way of the truth will be mal@@ igned .
in co@@ vet@@ ousness they will exploit you with dec@@ eptive words : whose sentence now from of old do@@ es@@ n '@@ t ling@@ er , and their destruction will not sl@@ umber .
for if God did@@ n '@@ t spare angels when they sin@@ ned , but cast them down to Tar@@ tar@@ us , and committed them to pits of darkness , to be reserved for judgment ;
and did@@ n '@@ t spare the ancient world , but preserved Noah with seven others , a preacher of righteousness , when he brought a flood on the world of the un@@ go@@ dly ;
and turning the cities of So@@ dom and Gom@@ or@@ rah into ashes , condemned them to destruction , having made them an example to those who would live un@@ go@@ dly ;
but chiefly those who walk after the flesh in the lust of de@@ fil@@ ement , and desp@@ ise authority . daring , self @@@ -@@ @ w@@ illed , they are not afraid to speak evil of dig@@ nit@@ aries ;
but these , as un@@ reasoning creatures , born natural animals to be taken and destroyed , speaking evil in matters about which they are ignorant , will in their destroying surely be destroyed ,
having eyes full of adul@@ tery , and who can '@@ t cease from sin ; entic@@ ing un@@ settled souls ; having a heart trained in greed ; children of cur@@ sing ;
for@@ s@@ aking the right way , they went astr@@ ay , having followed the way of Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Be@@ or , who loved the wages of wrong@@ doing ;
but he was rebu@@ ked for his own disobedience . a mute don@@ key spoke with a man 's voice and stopped the madness of the prophet .
these are wells without water , clouds driven by a storm ; for whom the black@@ ness of darkness has been reserved forever .
for , ut@@ tering great swelling words of emptiness , they enti@@ ce in the lu@@ sts of the flesh , by lic@@ enti@@ ousness , those who are indeed escaping from those who live in error ;
for if , after they have escaped the de@@ fil@@ ement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they are again ent@@ angled in it and overcome , the last state has become worse for them than the first .
that you should remember the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets , and the commandments of us , the apostles of the Lord and Savior :
and saying , " Where is the promise of his coming ? for , from the day that the fathers fell asleep , all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation . "
the Lord is not slow concerning his promise , as some count slow@@ ness ; but is patient with us , not wishing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance .
therefore since all these things will be destroyed like this , what kind of people ought you to be in holy living and god@@ liness ,
regard the patience of our Lord as salvation ; even as our beloved brother Paul also , according to the wisdom given to him , wrote to you ;
that which was from the beginning , that which we have heard , that which we have seen with our eyes , that which we saw , and our hands touched , concerning the Word of life
( and the life was revealed , and we have seen , and testify , and declare to you the life , the eternal life , which was with the Father , and was revealed to us ) ;
that which we have seen and heard we declare to you , that you also may have fellowship with us . yes , and our fellowship is with the Father , and with his Son , Jesus Christ .
but whoever keeps his word , God 's love has most certainly been perf@@ ected in him . this is how we know that we are in him :
brothers , I write no new commandment to you , but an old commandment which you had from the beginning . the old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning .
I write to you , little children , because your sins are forgiven you for his name 's sake .
I have written to you , fathers , because you know him who is from the beginning . I have written to you , young men , because you are strong , and the word of God remains in you , and you have overcome the evil one .
Don '@@ t love the world , neither the things that are in the world . if anyone loves the world , the Father 's love is@@ n '@@ t in him .
for all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is@@ n '@@ t the Father 's , but is the world 's .
little children , these are the end times , and as you heard that the Anti@@ ch@@ rist is coming , even now many anti@@ ch@@ rists have arisen . by this we know that it is the final hour .
whoever denies the Son , the same do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have the Father . he who conf@@ esses the Son has the Father also .
therefore , as for you , let that remain in you which you heard from the beginning . if that which you heard from the beginning remains in you , you also will remain in the Son , and in the Father .
behold , how great a love the Father has bestowed on us , that we should be called children of God ! for this cause the world do@@ es@@ n '@@ t know us , because it did@@ n '@@ t know him .
beloved , now we are children of God , and it is not yet revealed what we will be . but we know that , when he is revealed , we will be like him ; for we will see him just as he is .
he who sins is of the devil , for the devil has been s@@ inning from the beginning . to this end the Son of God was revealed , that he might destroy the works of the devil .
in this the children of God are revealed , and the children of the devil . whoever do@@ es@@ n '@@ t do righteousness is not of God , neither is he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t love his brother .
we know that we have passed out of death into life , because we love the brothers . he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t love his brother remains in death .
beloved , don '@@ t believe every spirit , but test the spirits , whether they are of God , because many false prophets have gone out into the world .
and every spirit who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God , and this is the spirit of the Anti@@ ch@@ rist , of whom you have heard that it comes . now it is in the world already .
we are of God . he who knows God list@@ ens to us . he who is not of God do@@ es@@ n '@@ t listen to us . by this we know the spirit of truth , and the spirit of error .
in this is love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us , and sent his Son as the at@@ oning sacrifice for our sins .
we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world .
in this love has been made perfect among us , that we may have bold@@ ness in the day of judgment , because as he is , even so are we in this world .
there is no fear in love ; but perfect love casts out fear , because fear has punishment . he who fears is not made perfect in love .
this is he who came by water and blood , Jesus Christ ; not with the water only , but with the water and the blood . it is the Spirit who testi@@ fies , because the Spirit is the truth .
he who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself . he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t believe God has made him a li@@ ar , because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son .
he who has the Son has the life . he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have God 's Son do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have the life .
we know that we are of God , and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one .
grace , mercy , and peace will be with us , from God the Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
now I beg you , dear lady , not as though I wrote to you a new commandment , but that which we had from the beginning , that we love one another .
for many decei@@ vers have gone out into the world , those who don '@@ t confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh . this is the decei@@ ver and the Anti@@ ch@@ rist .
whoever trans@@ g@@ resses and do@@ es@@ n '@@ t remain in the teaching of Christ , do@@ es@@ n '@@ t have God . he who remains in the teaching , the same has both the Father and the Son .
having many things to write to you , I don '@@ t want to do so with paper and ink , but I hope to come to you , and to speak face to face , that our joy may be made full .
they have testified about your love before the assembly . you will do well to send them forward on their journey in a way worthy of God ,
therefore if I come , I will call attention to his deeds which he does , un@@ justly accusing us with wicked words . not content with this , neither does he himself receive the brothers , and those who would , he for@@ bids and throws out of the assembly .
beloved , don '@@ t imitate that which is evil , but that which is good . he who does good is of God . he who does evil h@@ as@@ n '@@ t seen God .
Dem@@ et@@ ri@@ us has the testimony of all , and of the truth itself ; yes , we also testify , and you know that our testimony is true .
for there are certain men who cre@@ pt in secretly , even those who were long ago written about for this condemnation : un@@ go@@ dly men , turning the grace of our God into in@@ dec@@ ency , and denying our only Master , God , and Lord , Jesus Christ .
angels who did@@ n '@@ t keep their first domain , but deserted their own dwelling place , he has kept in everlasting bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day .
but Michael , the ar@@ chang@@ el , when cont@@ ending with the devil and arguing about the body of Moses , dared not bring against him an abusive condemnation , but said , " May the Lord rebu@@ ke you ! "
but these speak evil of whatever things they don '@@ t know . what they understand naturally , like the creatures without reason , they are destroyed in these things .
w@@ oe to them ! for they went in the way of C@@ ain , and ran ri@@ ot@@ ously in the error of Bal@@ a@@ am for hire , and perished in Kor@@ ah 's rebellion .
wild waves of the sea , fo@@ aming out their own shame ; wandering stars , for whom the black@@ ness of darkness has been reserved forever .
to execute judgment on all , and to conv@@ ict all the un@@ go@@ dly of all their works of un@@ god@@ liness which they have done in an un@@ go@@ dly way , and of all the hard things which un@@ go@@ dly sinners have spoken against him . "
they said to you that " In the last time there will be mo@@ c@@ kers , walking after their own un@@ go@@ dly lu@@ sts . "
this is the Revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave him to show to his servants the things which must happen soon , which he sent and made known by his angel to his servant , John ,
John , to the seven assemblies that are in Asia : grace to you and peace , from God , who is and who was and who is to come ; and from the seven Spir@@ its who are before his throne ;
and from Jesus Christ , the faithful witness , the fir@@ st@@ born of the dead , and the ruler of the kings of the earth . to him who loves us , and washed us from our sins by his blood ;
and he made us to be a Kingdom , priests to his God and Father ; to him be the glory and the dom@@ inion forever and ever . A@@ men .
behold , he is coming with the clouds , and every eye will see him , including those who pi@@ er@@ ced him . all the tribes of the earth will mour@@ n over him . even so , A@@ men .
" I am the Alph@@ a and the O@@ mega , " says the Lord God , " who is and who was and who is to come , the Almighty . "
I was in the Spirit on the Lord 's day , and I heard behind me a loud voice , like a trum@@ pet
his feet were like bur@@ nished brass , as if it had been refined in a furnace . his voice was like the voice of many waters .
write therefore the things which you have seen , and the things which are , and the things which will happen here@@ after ;
" to the angel of the assembly in S@@ my@@ r@@ na write : " the first and the last , who was dead , and has come to life says these things :
he who has an ear , let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies . he who over@@ comes won '@@ t be harmed by the second death .
repent therefore , or else I am coming to you quickly , and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth .
but I have this against you , that you tolerate your woman , J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel , who calls herself a proph@@ et@@ ess . she teaches and seduc@@ es my servants to commit sexual im@@ morality , and to eat things sacrificed to idols .
behold , I will throw her into a bed , and those who commit adul@@ tery with her into great oppression , unless they repent of her works .
I will kill her children with Death , and all the assemblies will know that I am he who searches the minds and hearts . I will give to each one of you according to your deeds .
wake up , and keep the things that remain , which you were about to throw away , for I have found no works of yours perf@@ ected before my God .
" I know your works ( behold , I have set before you an open door , which no one can shut ) , that you have a little power , and kept my word , and did@@ n '@@ t deny my name .
because you kept my command to endure , I also will keep you from the hour of testing , which is to come on the whole world , to test those who dwell on the earth .
behold , I stand at the door and knock . if anyone hears my voice and opens the door , then I will come in to him , and will dine with him , and he with me .
he who over@@ comes , I will give to him to sit down with me on my throne , as I also over@@ came , and sat down with my Father on his throne .
out of the throne proceed light@@ nings , sounds , and th@@ un@@ ders . there were seven lamps of fire burning before his throne , which are the seven Spir@@ its of God .
the first creature was like a lion , and the second creature like a cal@@ f , and the third creature had a face like a man , and the fourth was like a flying eagle .
when the living creatures give glory , honor , and thanks to him who sits on the throne , to him who lives forever and ever ,
the twenty @@@ -@@ @ four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne , and worship him who lives forever and ever , and throw their crow@@ ns before the throne , saying ,
I saw , in the right hand of him who sat on the throne , a book written inside and outside , sealed shut with seven seals .
I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice , " Who is worthy to open the book , and to break its seals ? "
one of the elders said to me , " Don '@@ t we@@ ep . behold , the Lion who is of the tribe of Jud@@ ah , the Root of David , has overcome ; he who opens the book and its seven seals . "
I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures , and in the midst of the elders , a Lam@@ b standing , as though it had been sl@@ ain , having seven horns , and seven eyes , which are the seven Spir@@ its of God , sent out into all the earth .
now when he had taken the book , the four living creatures and the twenty @@@ -@@ @ four elders fell down before the Lam@@ b , each one having a har@@ p , and golden bow@@ ls full of inc@@ ense , which are the prayers of the saints .
they sang a new song , saying , " You are worthy to take the book , and to open its seals : for you were killed , and bought us for God with your blood , out of every tribe , language , people , and nation ,
saying with a loud voice , " Wor@@ thy is the Lam@@ b who has been killed to receive the power , wealth , wisdom , strength , honor , glory , and blessing ! "
I saw that the Lam@@ b opened one of the seven seals , and I heard one of the four living creatures saying , as with a voice of thunder , " Come and see ! "
another came forth , a red horse . to him who sat on it was given power to take peace from the earth , and that they should kill one another . there was given to him a great sword .
I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying , " A cho@@ en@@ ix of wheat for a den@@ arius , and three cho@@ en@@ ix of barley for a den@@ arius ! Don '@@ t damage the oil and the wine ! "
they cried with a loud voice , saying , " How long , Master , the holy and true , until you judge and av@@ enge our blood on those who dwell on the earth ? "
the stars of the sky fell to the earth , like a fi@@ g tree dropping its un@@ ripe fi@@ gs when it is shaken by a great wind .
for the great day of his wrath has come ; and who is able to stand ? "
after this , I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , so that no wind would blow on the earth , or on the sea , or on any tree .
I saw another angel asc@@ end from the sunrise , having the seal of the living God . he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea ,
all the angels were standing around the throne , the elders , and the four living creatures ; and they fell on their faces before his throne , and worshi@@ ped God ,
one of the elders answered , saying to me , " These who are ar@@ ra@@ yed in white robes , who are they , and from where did they come ? "
I told him , " My lord , you know . " he said to me , " These are those who came out of the great tribu@@ lation . they washed their robes , and made them white in the Lam@@ b 's blood .
for the Lam@@ b who is in the midst of the throne shep@@ herds them , and leads them to springs of waters of life . and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes . "
another angel came and stood over the altar , having a golden cen@@ ser . much inc@@ ense was given to him , that he should add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne .
the angel took the cen@@ ser , and he filled it with the fire of the altar , and threw it on the earth . there followed th@@ un@@ ders , sounds , light@@ nings , and an earthquake .
the third angel sounded , and a great star fell from the sky , burning like a torch , and it fell on one third of the rivers , and on the springs of the waters .
the fourth angel sounded , and one third of the sun was struck , and one third of the moon , and one third of the stars ; so that one third of them would be dark@@ ened , and the day w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t shine for one third of it , and the night in the same way .
the fifth angel sounded , and I saw a star from the sky which had fallen to the earth . the key to the pit of the abyss was given to him .
he opened the pit of the abyss , and smoke went up out of the pit , like the smoke from a burning furnace . the sun and the air were dark@@ ened because of the smoke from the pit .
then out of the smoke came forth lo@@ cu@@ sts on the earth , and power was given to them , as the scor@@ pi@@ ons of the earth have power .
they were given power not to kill them , but to tor@@ ment them for five months . their tor@@ ment was like the tor@@ ment of a scor@@ pi@@ on , when it strikes a person .
in those days people will seek death , and will in no way find it . they will desire to die , and death will flee from them .
by these three pl@@ agues were one third of mankind killed : by the fire , the smoke , and the sulfur , which proceeded out of their mouths .
I saw a mighty angel coming down out of the sky , clo@@ thed with a cloud . a rain@@ bow was on his head . his face was like the sun , and his feet like pillars of fire .
when the seven th@@ un@@ ders sounded , I was about to write ; but I heard a voice from the sky saying , " Se@@ al up the things which the seven th@@ un@@ ders said , and don '@@ t write them . "
and s@@ wore by him who lives forever and ever , who created heaven and the things that are in it , the earth and the things that are in it , and the sea and the things that are in it , that there will no longer be delay ,
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he is about to sound , then the mystery of God is finished , as he declared to his servants , the prophets .
the voice which I heard from heaven , again speaking with me , said , " Go , take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land . "
I went to the angel , telling him to give me the little book . he said to me , " Take it , and eat it up . it will make your stomach bitter , but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey . "
a re@@ ed like a rod was given to me . someone said , " R@@ ise , and measure God 's temple , and the altar , and those who worship in it .
these are the two olive trees and the two lam@@ p@@ stands , standing before the Lord of the earth .
these have the power to shut up the sky , that it may not rain during the days of their prophecy . they have power over the waters , to turn them into blood , and to strike the earth with every plague , as often as they desire .
their dead bodies will be in the street of the great city , which spiritually is called So@@ dom and Egypt , where also their Lord was cruci@@ fied .
those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them , and they will be glad . they will give gifts to one another , because these two prophets tor@@ m@@ ented those who dwell on the earth .
in that day there was a great earthquake , and a tenth of the city fell . seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake , and the rest were terrified , and gave glory to the God of heaven .
the seventh angel sounded , and great voices in heaven followed , saying , " The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord , and of his Christ . he will reign forever and ever ! "
saying : " we give you thanks , Lord God , the Almighty , the one who is and who was ; because you have taken your great power , and re@@ igned .
God 's temple that is in heaven was opened , and the ark of the Lord 's covenant was seen in his temple . Light@@ nings , sounds , th@@ un@@ ders , an earthquake , and great hail followed .
his tail drew one third of the stars of the sky , and threw them to the earth . the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth , so that when she gave birth he might dev@@ our her child .
she gave birth to a son , a male child , who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron . her child was caught up to God , and to his throne .
therefore rejoice , heavens , and you who dwell in them . w@@ oe to the earth and to the sea , because the devil has gone down to you , having great wrath , knowing that he has but a short time . "
when the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth , he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child .
then I stood on the sand of the sea . I saw a beast coming up out of the sea , having ten horns and seven heads . on his horns were ten crow@@ ns , and on his heads , bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ous names .
a mouth speaking great things and bl@@ asph@@ emy was given to him . authority to make war for forty @@@ -@@ @ two months was given to him .
if anyone is to go into cap@@ tivity , he will go into cap@@ tivity . if anyone is to be killed with the sword , he must be killed . here is the endurance and the faith of the saints .
he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence . he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast , whose fatal wound was healed .
he performs great signs , even making fire come down out of the sky to the earth in the sight of people .
it was given to him to give breath to it , to the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause as many as w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t worship the image of the beast to be killed .
I saw , and behold , the Lam@@ b standing on Mount Z@@ ion , and with him a number , one hundred forty @@@ -@@ @ four thousand , having his name , and the name of his Father , written on their fore@@ heads .
I heard a sound from heaven , like the sound of many waters , and like the sound of a great thunder . the sound which I heard was like that of har@@ p@@ ists playing on their har@@ ps .
they sing a new song before the throne , and before the four living creatures and the elders . no one could learn the song except the one hundred forty @@@ -@@ @ four thousand , those who had been re@@ deemed out of the earth .
these are those who were not de@@ filed with women , for they are vir@@ gins . these are those who follow the Lam@@ b wherever he goes . these were re@@ deemed by Jesus from among men , the first fruits to God and to the Lam@@ b .
another , a second angel , followed , saying , " Babylon the great has fallen , which has made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her sexual im@@ morality . "
another angel , a third , followed them , saying with a great voice , " If anyone wor@@ ships the beast and his image , and receives a mark on his forehead , or on his hand ,
the smoke of their tor@@ ment goes up forever and ever . they have no rest day and night , those who worship the beast and his image , and whoever receives the mark of his name .
I looked , and behold , a white cloud ; and on the cloud one sitting like a son of man , having on his head a golden crown , and in his hand a sharp sick@@ le .
another angel came out from the temple , crying with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud , " Send forth your sick@@ le , and reap ; for the hour to reap has come ; for the harvest of the earth is ripe ! "
the angel thrust his sick@@ le into the earth , and gathered the v@@ intage of the earth , and threw it into the great win@@ ep@@ ress of the wrath of God .
they sang the song of Moses , the servant of God , and the song of the Lam@@ b , saying , " Great and marvelous are your works , Lord God , the Almighty ! righteous and true are your ways , you King of the nations .
who w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t fear you , Lord , and glori@@ fy your name ? for you only are holy . for all the nations will come and worship before you . for your righteous acts have been revealed . "
one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bow@@ ls full of the wrath of God , who lives forever and ever .
the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God , and from his power . no one was able to enter into the temple , until the seven pl@@ agues of the seven angels would be finished .
the first went , and poured out his bowl into the earth , and it became a harmful and evil sore on the people who had the mark of the beast , and who worshi@@ ped his image .
the second angel poured out his bowl into the sea , and it became blood as of a dead man . every living thing in the sea died .
for they poured out the blood of the saints and the prophets , and you have given them blood to drink . they deserve this . "
the fourth poured out his bowl on the sun , and it was given to him to scor@@ ch men with fire .
the sixth poured out his bowl on the great river , the E@@ uph@@ rates . its water was dried up , that the way might be prepared for the kings that come from the sunrise .
for they are spirits of demons , performing signs ; which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth , to gather them together for the war of that great day of God , the Almighty .
" behold , I come like a thief . blessed is he who watches , and keeps his clothes , so that he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t walk naked , and they see his shame . "
he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness . I saw a woman sitting on a scar@@ let @@@ -@@ @ colored animal , full of bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ous names , having seven heads and ten horns .
the woman was dressed in purple and scar@@ let , and dec@@ ked with gold and precious stones and pear@@ ls , having in her hand a golden cup full of ab@@ om@@ inations and the im@@ pur@@ ities of the sexual im@@ morality of the earth .
I saw the woman drun@@ ken with the blood of the saints , and with the blood of the marty@@ rs of Jesus . when I saw her , I wondered with great amaz@@ ement .
the angel said to me , " Why do you wonder ? I will tell you the mystery of the woman , and of the beast that carries her , which has the seven heads and the ten horns .
these will war against the Lam@@ b , and the Lam@@ b will overcome them , for he is Lord of lords , and King of kings . they also will overcome who are with him , called and chosen and faithful . "
the ten horns which you saw , and the beast , these will hate the pro@@ stitute , and will make her des@@ ol@@ ate , and will make her naked , and will eat her flesh , and will burn her utterly with fire .
for God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind , and to be of one mind , and to give their kingdom to the beast , until the words of God should be accomplished .
after these things , I saw another angel coming down out of the sky , having great authority . the earth was illuminated with his glory .
I heard another voice from heaven , saying , " Come out of her , my people , that you have no participation in her sins , and that you don '@@ t receive of her pl@@ agues ,
however much she glori@@ fied herself , and grew w@@ ant@@ on , so much give her of tor@@ ment and mourning . for she says in her heart , ' I sit a queen , and am no widow , and will in no way see mourning . '
therefore in one day her pl@@ agues will come : death , mourning , and famine ; and she will be utterly burned with fire ; for the Lord God who has judged her is strong .
the kings of the earth , who committed sexual im@@ morality and lived w@@ ant@@ only with her , will we@@ ep and w@@ ail over her , when they look at the smoke of her burning ,
standing far away for the fear of her tor@@ ment , saying , ' W@@ oe , w@@ oe , the great city , Babylon , the strong city ! for your judgment has come in one hour . '
the fruits which your soul lu@@ sted after have been lost to you , and all things that were d@@ ain@@ ty and su@@ mp@@ tuous have perished from you , and you will find them no more at all .
saying , ' W@@ oe , w@@ oe , the great city , she who was dressed in fine linen , purple , and scar@@ let , and dec@@ ked with gold and precious stones and pear@@ ls !
for in an hour such great riches are made des@@ ol@@ ate . ' every ship@@ master , and everyone who s@@ ails anywhere , and mar@@ in@@ ers , and as many as gain their living by sea , stood far away ,
and cried out as they looked at the smoke of her burning , saying , ' What is like the great city ? '
" rejoice over her , O heaven , you saints , apostles , and prophets ; for God has judged your judgment on her . "
a mighty angel took up a stone like a great mil@@ l@@ stone and cast it into the sea , saying , " Th@@ us with violence will Babylon , the great city , be thrown down , and will be found no more at all .
the light of a lamp will shine no more at all in you . the voice of the bri@@ deg@@ room and of the bride will be heard no more at all in you ; for your merchants were the princes of the earth ; for with your sor@@ cery all the nations were deceived .
for true and righteous are his judgments . for he has judged the great pro@@ stitute , who corrupted the earth with her sexual im@@ morality , and he has av@@ eng@@ ed the blood of his servants at her hand . "
the twenty @@@ -@@ @ four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshi@@ ped God who sits on the throne , saying , " A@@ men ! H@@ all@@ elu@@ jah ! "
a voice came forth from the throne , saying , " Gi@@ ve praise to our God , all you his servants , you who fear him , the small and the great ! "
I heard something like the voice of a great multitude , and like the voice of many waters , and like the voice of mighty th@@ un@@ ders , saying , " H@@ all@@ elu@@ jah ! for the Lord our God , the Almighty , re@@ igns !
I saw the heaven opened , and behold , a white horse , and he who sat on it is called F@@ ai@@ thful and True . in righteousness he judges and makes war .
he has on his garment and on his thi@@ gh a name written , " K@@ ING OF K@@ IN@@ GS , AND LORD OF L@@ ords . "
I saw an angel standing in the sun . he cried with a loud voice , saying to all the birds that fly in the sky , " Come ! be gathered together to the great sup@@ per of God ,
I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse , and against his army .
blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection . over these , the second death has no power , but they will be priests of God and of Christ , and will reign with him one thousand years .
the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur , where the beast and the false prophet are also . they will be tor@@ m@@ ented day and night forever and ever .
I saw a great white throne , and him who sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away . there was found no place for them .
I saw a new heaven and a new earth : for the first heaven and the first earth have passed away , and the sea is no more .
he will wipe away from them every tear from their eyes . death will be no more ; neither will there be mourning , nor crying , nor pain , any more . the first things have passed away . "
he who sits on the throne said , " Be@@ hold , I am making all things new . " he said , " Write , for these words of God are faithful and true . "
but for the cow@@ ardly , un@@ believing , sinners , ab@@ om@@ in@@ able , murderers , sexually immoral , sorcer@@ ers , id@@ ol@@ aters , and all li@@ ars , their part is in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur , which is the second death . "
one of the seven angels who had the seven bow@@ ls , who were loaded with the seven last pl@@ agues came , and he spoke with me , saying , " Come here . I will show you the wife , the Lam@@ b 's bride . "
the city lies four@@ square , and its length is as great as its breadth . he measured the city with the re@@ ed , T@@ wel@@ ve thousand twelve stad@@ ia . its length , breadth , and height are equal .
its wall is one hundred forty @@@ -@@ @ four cub@@ its , by the measure of a man , that is , of an angel .
the twelve gates were twelve pear@@ ls . each one of the gates was made of one pear@@ l . the street of the city was pure gold , like transparent glass .
there will in no way enter into it anything prof@@ ane , or one who causes an ab@@ om@@ ination or a lie , but only those who are written in the Lam@@ b 's book of life .
he showed me a river of water of life , clear as crystal , proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lam@@ b ,
in the middle of its street . on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life , bearing twelve kinds of fruits , yielding its fruit every month . the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
he said to me , " These words are faithful and true . the Lord God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to show to his bond@@ servants the things which must happen soon . "
now I , John , am the one who heard and saw these things . when I heard and saw , I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who had shown me these things .
blessed are those who do his commandments , that they may have the right to the tree of life , and may enter in by the gates into the city .
I , Jesus , have sent my angel to testify these things to you for the assemblies . I am the root and the offspring of David ; the B@@ right and Morning Star . "
he who testi@@ fies these things says , " Yes , I come quickly . " A@@ men ! yes , come , Lord Jesus .
and God said , Let there be a firm@@ ament in the midst of the waters , and let it divide the waters from the waters .
and God called the dry land Earth ; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas : and God saw that it was good .
and God said , Let the earth bring forth grass , the her@@ b yielding seed , and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind , whose seed is in itself , upon the earth : and it was so .
and God said , Let there be lights in the firm@@ ament of the heaven to divide the day from the night ; and let them be for signs , and for seasons , and for days , and years :
and let them be for lights in the firm@@ ament of the heaven to give light upon the earth : and it was so .
and to rule over the day and over the night , and to divide the light from the darkness : and God saw that it was good .
and God said , Let the waters bring forth ab@@ und@@ antly the moving creature that hath life , and f@@ owl that may fly above the earth in the open firm@@ ament of heaven .
and God said , Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind , cattle , and cre@@ eping thing , and beast of the earth after his kind : and it was so .
and God made the beast of the earth after his kind , and cattle after their kind , and every thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the earth after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
and God said , Let us make man in our image , after our lik@@ eness : and let them have dom@@ inion over the fish of the sea , and over the f@@ owl of the air , and over the cattle , and over all the earth , and over every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the earth .
and God said , Be@@ hold , I have given you every her@@ b bearing seed , which is upon the face of all the earth , and every tree , in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed ; to you it shall be for meat .
and to every beast of the earth , and to every f@@ owl of the air , and to every thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the earth , where@@ in there is life , I have given every green her@@ b for meat : and it was so .
these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created , in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens ,
and the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground , and breath@@ ed into his no@@ str@@ ils the breath of life ; and man became a living soul .
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil , thou shalt not eat of it : for in the day that thou e@@ at@@ est thereof thou shalt surely die .
and the LORD God said , It is not good that the man should be alone ; I will make him an help meet for him .
and the ri@@ b , which the LORD God had taken from man , made he a woman , and brought her unto the man .
therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cle@@ ave unto his wife : and they shall be one flesh .
now the ser@@ pent was more sub@@ til than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made . and he said unto the woman , Y@@ ea , hath God said , Y@@ e shall not eat of every tree of the garden ?
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden , God hath said , Y@@ e shall not eat of it , neither shall ye touch it , lest ye die .
and they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day : and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden .
and he said , I heard thy voice in the garden , and I was afraid , because I was naked ; and I hid myself .
and the LORD God said unto the woman , What is this that thou hast done ? and the woman said , The ser@@ pent be@@ gu@@ iled me , and I did eat .
and the LORD God said unto the ser@@ pent , Because thou hast done this , thou art cur@@ sed above all cattle , and above every beast of the field ; upon thy belly shalt thou go , and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life :
unto the woman he said , I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception ; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children ; and thy desire shall be to thy husband , and he shall rule over thee .
in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread , till thou return unto the ground ; for out of it w@@ ast thou taken : for dust thou art , and unto dust shalt thou return .
unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins , and clo@@ thed them .
and she again bare his brother A@@ bel . and A@@ bel was a keeper of sheep , but C@@ ain was a til@@ ler of the ground .
and A@@ bel , he also brought of the fir@@ st@@ lings of his flock and of the fat thereof . and the LORD had respect unto A@@ bel and to his offering :
and C@@ ain talked with A@@ bel his brother : and it came to pass , when they were in the field , that C@@ ain rose up against A@@ bel his brother , and sle@@ w him .
and Lam@@ ech took unto him two wives : the name of the one was Ad@@ ah , and the name of the other Z@@ il@@ lah .
and his brother 's name was J@@ ub@@ al : he was the father of all such as handle the har@@ p and organ .
and Z@@ il@@ lah , she also bare tu@@ bal @@@ -@@ @ C@@ ain , an instruc@@ ter of every arti@@ fic@@ er in brass and iron : and the sister of tu@@ bal @@@ -@@ @ C@@ ain was Na@@ am@@ ah .
and Lam@@ ech said unto his wives , Ad@@ ah and Z@@ il@@ lah , He@@ ar my voice ; ye wives of Lam@@ ech , hear@@ ken unto my speech : for I have sl@@ ain a man to my w@@ ounding , and a young man to my hurt .
and Adam lived an hundred and thirty years , and beg@@ at a son in his own lik@@ eness , after his image ; and called his name S@@ eth :
and the LORD said , My spirit shall not always strive with man , for that he also is flesh : yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years .
and it rep@@ ented the LORD that he had made man on the earth , and it griev@@ ed him at his heart .
and the LORD said , I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth ; both man , and beast , and the cre@@ eping thing , and the f@@ ow@@ ls of the air ; for it repent@@ eth me that I have made them .
and God said unto Noah , The end of all flesh is come before me ; for the earth is filled with violence through them ; and , behold , I will destroy them with the earth .
make thee an ark of g@@ op@@ her wood ; rooms shalt thou make in the ark , and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch .
and , behold , I , even I , do bring a flood of waters upon the earth , to destroy all flesh , where@@ in is the breath of life , from under heaven ; and every thing that is in the earth shall die .
but with thee will I establish my covenant ; and thou shalt come into the ark , thou , and thy sons , and thy wife , and thy sons ' wives with thee .
and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten , and thou shalt gather it to thee ; and it shall be for food for thee , and for them .
of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sev@@ ens , the male and his female : and of beasts that are not clean by two , the male and his female .
of f@@ ow@@ ls also of the air by sev@@ ens , the male and the female ; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth .
for yet seven days , and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights ; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth .
and Noah went in , and his sons , and his wife , and his sons ' wives with him , into the ark , because of the waters of the flood .
in the self@@ same day entered Noah , and She@@ m , and H@@ am , and Jap@@ h@@ eth , the sons of Noah , and Noah 's wife , and the three wives of his sons with them , into the ark ;
and they went in unto Noah into the ark , two and two of all flesh , where@@ in is the breath of life .
and they that went in , went in male and female of all flesh , as God had commanded him : and the LORD shut him in .
and the flood was forty days upon the earth ; and the waters increased , and bare up the ark , and it was lift up above the earth .
and the waters prevailed , and were increased greatly upon the earth ; and the ark went upon the face of the waters .
and all flesh died that moved upon the earth , both of f@@ owl , and of cattle , and of beast , and of every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the earth , and every man :
all in whose no@@ str@@ ils was the breath of life , of all that was in the dry land , died .
and the waters returned from off the earth continually : and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated .
and the ark rested in the seventh month , on the seventeenth day of the month , upon the mountains of Ar@@ ar@@ at .
and he sent forth a ra@@ ven , which went forth to and fro , until the waters were dried up from off the earth .
also he sent forth a do@@ ve from him , to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground ;
and the do@@ ve came in to him in the evening ; and , lo , in her mouth was an olive leaf pl@@ uck@@ t off : so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth .
and in the second month , on the seven and twentieth day of the month , was the earth dried .
bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee , of all flesh , both of f@@ owl , and of cattle , and of every cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the earth ; that they may breed ab@@ und@@ antly in the earth , and be fruitful , and multiply upon the earth .
and Noah buil@@ ded an altar unto the LORD ; and took of every clean beast , and of every clean f@@ owl , and offered burnt offerings on the altar .
and the LORD sm@@ elled a sweet sav@@ our ; and the LORD said in his heart , I will not again curse the ground any more for man 's sake ; for the imagination of man 's heart is evil from his youth ; neither will I again sm@@ ite any more every thing living , as I have done .
and surely your blood of your lives will I require ; at the hand of every beast will I require it , and at the hand of man ; at the hand of every man 's brother will I require the life of man .
wh@@ os@@ o sh@@ ed@@ det@@ h man 's blood , by man shall his blood be shed : for in the image of God made he man .
I do set my bow in the cloud , and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth .
and the bow shall be in the cloud ; and I will look upon it , that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth .
and God said unto Noah , This is the token of the covenant , which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth .
and the sons of Noah , that went forth of the ark , were She@@ m , and H@@ am , and Jap@@ h@@ eth : and H@@ am is the father of Can@@ a@@ an .
and She@@ m and Jap@@ h@@ eth took a garment , and laid it upon both their shoulders , and went backward , and covered the n@@ ak@@ edness of their father ; and their faces were backward , and they saw not their father 's n@@ ak@@ edness .
the sons of Jap@@ h@@ eth ; Gom@@ er , and Mag@@ og , and Mad@@ ai , and Jav@@ an , and tu@@ bal , and M@@ esh@@ ech , and Tir@@ as .
and the beginning of his kingdom was Bab@@ el , and E@@ rec@@ h , and Acc@@ ad , and Cal@@ ne@@ h , in the land of Shin@@ ar .
out of that land went forth As@@ sh@@ ur , and buil@@ ded N@@ inev@@ eh , and the city Re@@ ho@@ both , and Cal@@ ah ,
and unto E@@ ber were born two sons : the name of one was P@@ ele@@ g ; for in his days was the earth divided ; and his brother 's name was Jo@@ k@@ tan .
and they said one to another , Go to , let us make brick , and burn them through@@ ly . and they had brick for stone , and sli@@ me had they for mor@@ ter .
and the LORD said , Be@@ hold , the people is one , and they have all one language ; and this they begin to do : and now nothing will be restrained from them , which they have imagined to do .
now the LORD had said unto Ab@@ ram , Get thee out of thy country , and from thy kind@@ red , and from thy father 's house , unto a land that I will sh@@ ew thee :
and I will make of thee a great nation , and I will bless thee , and make thy name great ; and thou shalt be a blessing :
so Ab@@ ram departed , as the LORD had spoken unto him ; and L@@ ot went with him : and Ab@@ ram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Har@@ an .
and Ab@@ ram passed through the land unto the place of Sic@@ hem , unto the plain of More@@ h . and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite was then in the land .
and the LORD appeared unto Ab@@ ram , and said , Un@@ to thy seed will I give this land : and there buil@@ ded he an altar unto the LORD , who appeared unto him .
and it came to pass , when he was come near to enter into Egypt , that he said unto Sar@@ ai his wife , Be@@ hold now , I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon :
say , I pray thee , thou art my sister : that it may be well with me for thy sake ; and my soul shall live because of thee .
and it came to pass , that , when Ab@@ ram was come into Egypt , the Egyptians be@@ held the woman that she was very fair .
the princes also of Phar@@ aoh saw her , and commended her before Phar@@ aoh : and the woman was taken into Phar@@ aoh 's house .
and he entre@@ ated Ab@@ ram well for her sake : and he had sheep , and ox@@ en , and he asses , and men@@ servants , and mai@@ d@@ servants , and she asses , and cam@@ els .
and Phar@@ aoh called Ab@@ ram , and said , What is this that thou hast done unto me ? why did@@ st thou not tell me that she was thy wife ?
why s@@ ai@@ d@@ st thou , She is my sister ? so I might have taken her to me to wife : now therefore behold thy wife , take her , and go thy way .
and he went on his journeys from the south even to Be@@ the@@ l , unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning , between Be@@ the@@ l and H@@ ai ;
and there was a strife between the her@@ d@@ men of Ab@@ ram 's cattle and the her@@ d@@ men of L@@ ot 's cattle : and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite dw@@ elled then in the land .
and Ab@@ ram said unto L@@ ot , Let there be no strife , I pray thee , between me and thee , and between my her@@ d@@ men and thy her@@ d@@ men ; for we be brethren .
and L@@ ot lifted up his eyes , and be@@ held all the plain of Jordan , that it was well wat@@ ered every where , before the LORD destroyed So@@ dom and Gom@@ or@@ rah , even as the garden of the LORD , like the land of Egypt , as thou com@@ est unto Zo@@ ar .
and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth : so that if a man can number the dust of the earth , then shall thy seed also be numbered .
arise , walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it ; for I will give it unto thee .
and in the four@@ teenth year came Ch@@ ed@@ or@@ la@@ om@@ er , and the kings that were with him , and smo@@ te the Rep@@ ha@@ ims in Ash@@ ter@@ o@@ th Kar@@ n@@ aim , and the Z@@ uz@@ ims in H@@ am , and the Em@@ ims in Sha@@ ve@@ h Kiri@@ ath@@ aim ,
and they took all the goods of So@@ dom and Gom@@ or@@ rah , and all their vic@@ tu@@ als , and went their way .
and they took L@@ ot , Ab@@ ram 's brother 's son , who d@@ wel@@ t in So@@ dom , and his goods , and departed .
and there came one that had escaped , and told Ab@@ ram the Hebrew ; for he d@@ wel@@ t in the plain of Mam@@ re the A@@ mor@@ ite , brother of E@@ sch@@ ol , and brother of An@@ er : and these were con@@ feder@@ ate with Ab@@ ram .
and the king of So@@ dom said unto Ab@@ ram , Gi@@ ve me the persons , and take the goods to thy@@ self .
after these things the word of the LORD came unto Ab@@ ram in a vision , saying , Fe@@ ar not , Ab@@ ram : I am thy shield , and thy exceeding great reward .
and Ab@@ ram said , Lord GO@@ D , what wil@@ t thou give me , seeing I go chil@@ dless , and the ste@@ ward of my house is this Eli@@ ez@@ er of Damascus ?
and Ab@@ ram said , Be@@ hold , to me thou hast given no seed : and , lo , one born in my house is mine heir .
and , behold , the word of the LORD came unto him , saying , This shall not be th@@ ine heir ; but he that shall come forth out of th@@ ine own bow@@ els shall be th@@ ine heir .
and he brought him forth abroad , and said , Look now toward heaven , and tell the stars , if thou be able to number them : and he said unto him , So shall thy seed be .
and he said unto him , I am the LORD that brought thee out of U@@ r of the Chal@@ de@@ es , to give thee this land to inherit it .
and he took unto him all these , and divided them in the midst , and laid each piece one against another : but the birds divided he not .
and when the sun was going down , a deep sleep fell upon Ab@@ ram ; and , lo , an horror of great darkness fell upon him .
and he said unto Ab@@ ram , Know of a su@@ rety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs , and shall serve them ; and they shall aff@@ l@@ ict them four hundred years ;
but in the fourth generation they shall come hi@@ ther again : for the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the A@@ mor@@ ites is not yet full .
in the same day the LORD made a covenant with Ab@@ ram , saying , Un@@ to thy seed have I given this land , from the river of Egypt unto the great river , the river E@@ uph@@ rates :
and he went in unto Hag@@ ar , and she conceived : and when she saw that she had conceived , her mistress was desp@@ ised in her eyes .
and Sar@@ ai said unto Ab@@ ram , My wrong be upon thee : I have given my maid into thy bos@@ om ; and when she saw that she had conceived , I was desp@@ ised in her eyes : the LORD judge between me and thee .
but Ab@@ ram said unto Sar@@ ai , Be@@ hold , thy maid is in thy hand ; do to her as it pleas@@ eth thee . and when Sar@@ ai dealt hardly with her , she fled from her face .
and the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness , by the fountain in the way to Sh@@ ur .
and he said , Hag@@ ar , Sar@@ ai 's maid , wh@@ ence cam@@ est thou ? and whi@@ ther wil@@ t thou go ? and she said , I flee from the face of my mistress Sar@@ ai .
and the angel of the LORD said unto her , Be@@ hold , thou art with child , and shalt bear a son , and shalt call his name I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el ; because the LORD hath heard thy afflic@@ tion .
and he will be a wild man ; his hand will be against every man , and every man 's hand against him ; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren .
and when Ab@@ ram was ninety years old and nine , the LORD appeared to Ab@@ ram , and said unto him , I am the Almighty God ; walk before me , and be thou perfect .
neither shall thy name any more be called Ab@@ ram , but thy name shall be Abraham ; for a father of many nations have I made thee .
and I will give unto thee , and to thy seed after thee , the land where@@ in thou art a stranger , all the land of Can@@ a@@ an , for an everlasting possession ; and I will be their God .
and he that is eight days old shall be circum@@ c@@ ised among you , every man child in your generations , he that is born in the house , or bought with money of any stranger , which is not of thy seed .
he that is born in thy house , and he that is bought with thy money , must needs be circum@@ c@@ ised : and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant .
and I will bless her , and give thee a son also of her : ye@@ a , I will bless her , and she shall be a mother of nations ; kings of people shall be of her .
then Abraham fell upon his face , and laughed , and said in his heart , Sh@@ all a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old ? and shall Sarah , that is ninety years old , bear ?
and God said , Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed ; and thou shalt call his name Isaac : and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant , and with his seed after him .
and as for I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , I have heard thee : behold , I have blessed him , and will make him fruitful , and will multiply him exceedingly ; twelve princes shall he be@@ get , and I will make him a great nation .
and all the men of his house , born in the house , and bought with money of the stranger , were circum@@ c@@ ised with him .
and said , My Lord , if now I have found favour in thy sight , pass not away , I pray thee , from thy servant :
let a little water , I pray you , be fetched , and wash your feet , and rest yourselves under the tree :
and I will fetch a mor@@ sel of bread , and comfort ye your hearts ; after that ye shall pass on : for therefore are ye come to your servant . and they said , So do , as thou hast said .
and Abraham ha@@ st@@ ened into the tent unto Sarah , and said , Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal , kne@@ ad it , and make cakes upon the hear@@ th .
and Abraham ran unto the herd , and fet@@ cht a cal@@ f tender and good , and gave it unto a young man ; and he ha@@ sted to dress it .
and he said , I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life ; and , lo , Sarah thy wife shall have a son . and Sarah heard it in the tent door , which was behind him .
now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age ; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women .
is any thing too hard for the LORD ? at the time appointed I will return unto thee , according to the time of life , and Sarah shall have a son .
and the men rose up from th@@ ence , and looked toward So@@ dom : and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way .
I will go down now , and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it , which is come unto me ; and if not , I will know .
and the LORD said , If I find in So@@ dom fifty righteous within the city , then I will spare all the place for their s@@ akes .
and Abraham answered and said , Be@@ hold now , I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord , which am but dust and ashes :
Per@@ adventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous : wil@@ t thou destroy all the city for lack of five ? and he said , If I find there forty and five , I will not destroy it .
and he sp@@ ake unto him yet again , and said , Per@@ adventure there shall be forty found there . and he said , I will not do it for forty 's sake .
and he said unto him , Oh let not the Lord be angry , and I will speak : Per@@ adventure there shall thirty be found there . and he said , I will not do it , if I find thirty there .
and he said , Oh let not the Lord be angry , and I will speak yet but this once : Per@@ adventure ten shall be found there . and he said , I will not destroy it for ten 's sake .
and the LORD went his way , as soon as he had left commun@@ ing with Abraham : and Abraham returned unto his place .
and there came two angels to So@@ dom at even ; and L@@ ot sat in the gate of So@@ dom : and L@@ ot seeing them rose up to meet them ; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground ;
and he pressed upon them greatly ; and they turned in unto him , and entered into his house ; and he made them a feast , and did b@@ ake un@@ leav@@ ened bread , and they did eat .
but before they lay down , the men of the city , even the men of So@@ dom , comp@@ assed the house round , both old and young , all the people from every quarter :
and they called unto L@@ ot , and said unto him , Where are the men which came in to thee this night ? bring them out unto us , that we may know them .
and they smo@@ te the men that were at the door of the house with blindness , both small and great : so that they wear@@ ied themselves to find the door .
for we will destroy this place , because the cry of them is wa@@ x@@ en great before the face of the LORD ; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it .
and when the morning arose , then the angels ha@@ st@@ ened L@@ ot , saying , A@@ rise , take thy wife , and thy two daughters , which are here ; lest thou be consumed in the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the city .
and while he ling@@ ered , the men laid hold upon his hand , and upon the hand of his wife , and upon the hand of his two daughters ; the LORD being mer@@ ciful unto him : and they brought him forth , and set him without the city .
and it came to pass , when they had brought them forth abroad , that he said , Es@@ cape for thy life ; look not behind thee , neither stay thou in all the plain ; escape to the mountain , lest thou be consumed .
and he said unto him , See , I have accepted thee concerning this thing also , that I will not overthrow this city , for the which thou hast spoken .
and he over@@ threw those cities , and all the plain , and all the inhabitants of the cities , and that which grew upon the ground .
and he looked toward So@@ dom and Gom@@ or@@ rah , and toward all the land of the plain , and be@@ held , and , lo , the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace .
and it came to pass , when God destroyed the cities of the plain , that God remembered Abraham , and sent L@@ ot out of the midst of the overthrow , when he over@@ threw the cities in the which L@@ ot d@@ wel@@ t .
and the fir@@ st@@ born said unto the younger , Our father is old , and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth :
and the fir@@ st@@ born bare a son , and called his name Mo@@ ab : the same is the father of the Mo@@ ab@@ ites unto this day .
and the younger , she also bare a son , and called his name Ben@@ amm@@ i : the same is the father of the children of Am@@ mon unto this day .
but God came to Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h in a dream by night , and said to him , Be@@ hold , thou art but a dead man , for the woman which thou hast taken ; for she is a man 's wife .
said he not unto me , She is my sister ? and she , even she herself said , He is my brother : in the integrity of my heart and inno@@ c@@ ency of my hands have I done this .
now therefore restore the man his wife ; for he is a prophet , and he shall pray for thee , and thou shalt live : and if thou restore her not , know thou that thou shalt surely die , thou , and all that are th@@ ine .
and Abraham said , Because I thought , Su@@ rely the fear of God is not in this place ; and they will sl@@ ay me for my wife 's sake .
and yet indeed she is my sister ; she is the daughter of my father , but not the daughter of my mother ; and she became my wife .
and unto Sarah he said , Be@@ hold , I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver : behold , he is to thee a covering of the eyes , unto all that are with thee , and with all other : thus she was re@@ proved .
for Sarah conceived , and bare Abraham a son in his old age , at the set time of which God had spoken to him .
and she said , Who would have said unto Abraham , that Sarah should have given children su@@ ck ? for I have born him a son in his old age .
W@@ herefore she said unto Abraham , C@@ ast out this bond@@ woman and her son : for the son of this bond@@ woman shall not be heir with my son , even with Isaac .
and also of the son of the bond@@ woman will I make a nation , because he is thy seed .
and Abraham rose up early in the morning , and took bread , and a bottle of water , and gave it unto Hag@@ ar , putting it on her shoulder , and the child , and sent her away : and she departed , and wan@@ dered in the wilderness of Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba .
and she went , and sat her down over against him a good way off , as it were a bow@@ shot : for she said , Let me not see the death of the child . and she sat over against him , and lift up her voice , and we@@ pt .
and God heard the voice of the l@@ ad ; and the angel of God called Hag@@ ar out of heaven , and said unto her , What ail@@ eth thee , Hag@@ ar ? fear not ; for God hath heard the voice of the l@@ ad where he is .
and God opened her eyes , and she saw a well of water ; and she went , and filled the bottle with water , and gave the l@@ ad drink .
and he d@@ wel@@ t in the wilderness of Par@@ an : and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt .
and it came to pass at that time , that Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h and Ph@@ ic@@ hol the chief captain of his host sp@@ ake unto Abraham , saying , God is with thee in all that thou do@@ est :
and Abraham re@@ proved Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h because of a well of water , which Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h 's servants had violently taken away .
and he said , For these seven e@@ we lam@@ bs shalt thou take of my hand , that they may be a witness unto me , that I have di@@ gged this well .
and he said , Take now thy son , th@@ ine only son Isaac , whom thou LO@@ VE@@ ST , and get thee into the land of M@@ ori@@ ah ; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of .
and Abraham rose up early in the morning , and sadd@@ led his ass , and took two of his young men with him , and Isaac his son , and cl@@ ave the wood for the burnt offering , and rose up , and went unto the place of which God had told him .
and Abraham said unto his young men , A@@ bi@@ de ye here with the ass ; and I and the l@@ ad will go y@@ on@@ der and worship , and come again to you ,
and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering , and laid it upon Isaac his son ; and he took the fire in his hand , and a knife ; and they went both of them together .
and Isaac sp@@ ake unto Abraham his father , and said , My father : and he said , Here am I , my son . and he said , Be@@ hold the fire and the wood : but where is the lamb for a burnt offering ?
and Abraham said , My son , God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering : so they went both of them together .
and they came to the place which God had told him of ; and Abraham built an altar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar upon the wood .
and the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven , and said , Abraham , Abraham : and he said , Here am I.
and he said , L@@ ay not th@@ ine hand upon the l@@ ad , neither do thou any thing unto him : for now I know that thou fe@@ arest God , seeing thou hast not with@@ held thy son , th@@ ine only son from me .
and Abraham lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold behind him a ram caught in a th@@ icket by his horns : and Abraham went and took the ram , and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son .
so Abraham returned unto his young men , and they rose up and went together to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba ; and Abraham d@@ wel@@ t at Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba .
I am a stranger and a so@@ jour@@ ner with you : give me a possession of a bur@@ y@@ ing@@ place with you , that I may bury my dead out of my sight .
and he commun@@ ed with them , saying , If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight ; hear me , and int@@ re@@ at for me to E@@ ph@@ ron the son of Zo@@ har ,
that he may give me the cave of Mach@@ pel@@ ah , which he hath , which is in the end of his field ; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a bur@@ y@@ ing@@ place amongst you .
and E@@ ph@@ ron d@@ wel@@ t among the children of H@@ eth : and E@@ ph@@ ron the Hit@@ tite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of H@@ eth , even of all that went in at the gate of his city , saying ,
n@@ ay , my lord , hear me : the field give I thee , and the cave that is therein , I give it thee ; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee : bury thy dead .
and Abraham hear@@ k@@ ened unto E@@ ph@@ ron ; and Abraham weighed to E@@ ph@@ ron the silver , which he had named in the audience of the sons of H@@ eth , four hundred she@@ k@@ els of silver , current money with the merchant .
and the field of E@@ ph@@ ron , which was in Mach@@ pel@@ ah , which was before Mam@@ re , the field , and the cave which was therein , and all the trees that were in the field , that were in all the borders round about , were made sure
and the field , and the cave that is therein , were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a bur@@ y@@ ing@@ place by the sons of H@@ eth .
and Abraham was old , and well stricken in age : and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things .
and Abraham said unto his el@@ dest servant of his house , that ruled over all that he had , P@@ ut , I pray thee , thy hand under my thi@@ gh :
but thou shalt go unto my country , and to my kind@@ red , and take a wife unto my son Isaac .
and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee , then thou shalt be clear from this my oath : only bring not my son thi@@ ther again .
and the servant took ten cam@@ els of the cam@@ els of his master , and departed ; for all the goods of his master were in his hand : and he arose , and went to Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , unto the city of N@@ ah@@ or .
and he said , O LORD God of my master Abraham , I pray thee , send me good speed this day , and sh@@ ew kindness unto my master Abraham .
and it came to pass , before he had done speaking , that , behold , Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah came out , who was born to Beth@@ u@@ el , son of Mil@@ ca@@ h , the wife of N@@ ah@@ or , Abraham 's brother , with her p@@ itch@@ er upon her shoulder .
and when she had done giving him drink , she said , I will draw water for thy cam@@ els also , until they have done drinking .
and she ha@@ sted , and emp@@ tied her p@@ itch@@ er into the tr@@ ough , and ran again unto the well to draw water , and drew for all his cam@@ els .
and it came to pass , as the cam@@ els had done drinking , that the man took a golden ear@@ ring of half a she@@ kel weight , and two brac@@ elets for her hands of ten she@@ k@@ els weight of gold ;
and said , Wh@@ ose daughter art thou ? tell me , I pray thee : is there room in thy father 's house for us to lodge in ?
and Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah had a brother , and his name was Lab@@ an : and Lab@@ an ran out unto the man , unto the well .
and he said , Come in , thou blessed of the LORD ; where@@ fore stand@@ est thou without ? for I have prepared the house , and room for the cam@@ els .
and the man came into the house : and he un@@ gir@@ ded his cam@@ els , and gave straw and pro@@ ven@@ der for the cam@@ els , and water to wash his feet , and the men 's feet that were with him .
and there was set meat before him to eat : but he said , I will not eat , until I have told mine err@@ and . and he said , Spe@@ ak on .
and the LORD hath blessed my master greatly ; and he is become great : and he hath given him f@@ locks , and herds , and silver , and gold , and men@@ servants , and mai@@ d@@ servants , and cam@@ els , and asses .
and Sarah my master 's wife bare a son to my master when she was old : and unto him hath he given all that he hath .
but thou shalt go unto my father 's house , and to my kind@@ red , and take a wife unto my son .
and he said unto me , The LORD , before whom I walk , will send his angel with thee , and prosper thy way ; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kind@@ red , and of my father 's house :
and she say to me , Bo@@ th drink thou , and I will also draw for thy cam@@ els : let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master 's son .
and before I had done speaking in mine heart , behold , Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah came forth with her p@@ itch@@ er on her shoulder ; and she went down unto the well , and drew water : and I said unto her , Let me drink , I pray thee .
and she made ha@@ ste , and let down her p@@ itch@@ er from her shoulder , and said , Dr@@ ink , and I will give thy cam@@ els drink also : so I drank , and she made the cam@@ els drink also .
and I asked her , and said , Wh@@ ose daughter art thou ? and she said , The daughter of Beth@@ u@@ el , N@@ ah@@ or 's son , whom Mil@@ ca@@ h bare unto him : and I put the ear@@ ring upon her face , and the brac@@ elets upon her hands .
and I bowed down my head , and wor@@ shipped the LORD , and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham , which had led me in the right way to take my master 's brother 's daughter unto his son .
and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master , tell me : and if not , tell me ; that I may turn to the right hand , or to the left .
behold , Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah is before thee , take her , and go , and let her be thy master 's son 's wife , as the LORD hath spoken .
and the servant brought forth jew@@ els of silver , and jew@@ els of gold , and ra@@ iment , and gave them to Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah : he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things .
and they did eat and drink , he and the men that were with him , and tar@@ ried all night ; and they rose up in the morning , and he said , Send me away unto my master .
and her brother and her mother said , Let the dam@@ sel abide with us a few days , at the least ten ; after that she shall go .
and they called Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah , and said unto her , Wil@@ t thou go with this man ? and she said , I will go .
and they blessed Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah , and said unto her , Th@@ ou art our sister , be thou the mother of thousands of millions , and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them .
and Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the ev@@ enti@@ de : and he lifted up his eyes , and saw , and , behold , the cam@@ els were coming .
for she had said unto the servant , What man is this that wal@@ ket@@ h in the field to meet us ? and the servant had said , It is my master : therefore she took a V@@ ail , and covered herself .
and Jo@@ k@@ shan beg@@ at She@@ ba , and D@@ ed@@ an . and the sons of D@@ ed@@ an were As@@ sh@@ ur@@ im , and Let@@ us@@ him , and Le@@ um@@ mi@@ m .
then Abraham gave up the ghost , and died in a good old age , an old man , and full of years ; and was gathered to his people .
and it came to pass after the death of Abraham , that God blessed his son Isaac ; and Isaac d@@ wel@@ t by the well La@@ hai @@@ -@@ @ RO@@ I .
and these are the names of the sons of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , by their names , according to their generations : the fir@@ st@@ born of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , Ne@@ ba@@ jo@@ th ; and K@@ edar , and Ad@@ be@@ el , and Mi@@ b@@ s@@ am ,
and they d@@ wel@@ t from Hav@@ il@@ ah unto Sh@@ ur , that is before Egypt , as thou go@@ est toward As@@ sy@@ ria : and he died in the presence of all his brethren .
and Isaac was forty years old when he took Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah to wife , the daughter of Beth@@ u@@ el the Syrian of Pad@@ an @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am , the sister to Lab@@ an the Syrian .
and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled , behold , there were twins in her womb .
and after that came his brother out , and his hand took hold on Es@@ au 's heel ; and his name was called Jacob : and Isaac was thre@@ es@@ core years old when she bare them .
and the boys grew : and Es@@ au was a cunning hunter , a man of the field ; and Jacob was a plain man , dwelling in tents .
and Es@@ au said to Jacob , Fe@@ ed me , I pray thee , with that same red pot@@ tage ; for I am faint : therefore was his name called E@@ dom .
and Jacob said , swear to me this day ; and he sw@@ are unto him : and he sold his birth@@ right unto Jacob .
then Jacob gave Es@@ au bread and pot@@ tage of l@@ enti@@ les ; and he did eat and drink , and rose up , and went his way : thus Es@@ au desp@@ ised his birth@@ right .
and there was a famine in the land , beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham . and Isaac went unto Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h king of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines unto Ger@@ ar .
and the LORD appeared unto him , and said , Go not down into Egypt ; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of :
so@@ jour@@ n in this land , and I will be with thee , and will bless thee ; for unto thee , and unto thy seed , I will give all these countries , and I will perform the oath which I sw@@ are unto Abraham thy father ;
and it came to pass , when he had been there a long time , that Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h king of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines looked out at a window , and saw , and , behold , Isaac was sporting with Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah his wife .
and Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h said , What is this thou hast done unto us ? one of the people might lightly have li@@ en with thy wife , and thou shoul@@ dest have brought guil@@ t@@ iness upon us .
for all the wells which his father 's servants had di@@ gged in the days of Abraham his father , the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had stopped them , and filled them with earth .
and the her@@ d@@ men of Ger@@ ar did strive with Isaac 's her@@ d@@ men , saying , The water is ours : and he called the name of the well E@@ se@@ k ; because they stro@@ ve with him .
and he removed from th@@ ence , and di@@ gged another well ; and for that they stro@@ ve not : and he called the name of it Re@@ ho@@ both ; and he said , For now the LORD hath made room for us , and we shall be fruitful in the land .
and the LORD appeared unto him the same night , and said , I am the God of Abraham thy father : fear not , for I am with thee , and will bless thee , and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham 's sake .
and he buil@@ ded an altar there , and called upon the name of the LORD and pit@@ ched his tent there : and there Isaac 's servants di@@ gged a well .
then Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h went to him from Ger@@ ar , and A@@ hu@@ zz@@ ath one of his friends , and Ph@@ ic@@ hol the chief captain of his army .
and they said , We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee : and we said , Let there be now an oath bet@@ wi@@ x@@ t us , even bet@@ wi@@ x@@ t us and thee , and let us make a covenant with thee ;
that thou wil@@ t do us no hurt , as we have not touched thee , and as we have done unto thee nothing but good , and have sent thee away in peace : thou art now the blessed of the LORD .
and they rose up be@@ times in the morning , and sw@@ are one to another : and Isaac sent them away , and they departed from him in peace .
and it came to pass the same day , that Isaac 's servants came , and told him concerning the well which they had di@@ gged , and said unto him , We have found water .
and he said , Be@@ hold now , I am old , I know not the day of my death :
now therefore take , I pray thee , thy weapons , thy qui@@ ver and thy bow , and go out to the field , and take me some ven@@ ison ;
and make me sav@@ our@@ y meat , such as I love , and bring it to me , that I may eat ; that my soul may bless thee before I die .
and Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah heard when Isaac sp@@ ake to Es@@ au his son . and Es@@ au went to the field to hunt for ven@@ ison , and to bring it .
go now to the flock , and fetch me from th@@ ence two good kids of the goats ; and I will make them sav@@ our@@ y meat for thy father , such as he lov@@ eth :
and thou shalt bring it to thy father , that he may eat , and that he may bless thee before his death .
my father per@@ adventure will feel me , and I shall seem to him as a decei@@ ver ; and I shall bring a curse upon me , and not a blessing .
and she gave the sav@@ our@@ y meat and the bread , which she had prepared , into the hand of her son Jacob .
and Jacob said unto his father , I am Es@@ au thy fir@@ st@@ born ; I have done according as thou bad@@ est me : arise , I pray thee , sit and eat of my ven@@ ison , that thy soul may bless me .
and Isaac said unto his son , How is it that thou hast found it so quickly , my son ? and he said , Because the LORD thy God brought it to me .
and Isaac said unto Jacob , Come near , I pray thee , that I may feel thee , my son , whether thou be my very son Es@@ au or not .
and Jacob went near unto Isaac his father ; and he felt him , and said , The voice is Jacob 's voice , but the hands are the hands of Es@@ au .
and he came near , and kis@@ sed him : and he sm@@ elled the smell of his ra@@ iment , and blessed him , and said , See , the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed :
and it came to pass , as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob , and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father , that Es@@ au his brother came in from his hunting .
and he also had made sav@@ our@@ y meat , and brought it unto his father , and said unto his father , Let my father arise , and eat of his son 's ven@@ ison , that thy soul may bless me .
and when Es@@ au heard the words of his father , he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry , and said unto his father , B@@ less me , even me also , O my father .
and Isaac answered and said unto Es@@ au , Be@@ hold , I have made him thy lord , and all his brethren have I given to him for servants ; and with corn and wine have I sustained him : and what shall I do now unto thee , my son ?
and Es@@ au said unto his father , H@@ ast thou but one blessing , my father ? bless me , even me also , O my father . and Es@@ au lifted up his voice , and we@@ pt .
and Isaac his father answered and said unto him , Be@@ hold , thy dwelling shall be the fat@@ ness of the earth , and of the de@@ w of heaven from above ;
and by thy sword shalt thou live , and shalt serve thy brother ; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dom@@ inion , that thou shalt break his y@@ oke from off thy neck .
and these words of Es@@ au her elder son were told to Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah : and she sent and called Jacob her younger son , and said unto him , Be@@ hold , thy brother Es@@ au , as touching thee , do@@ th comfort himself , pur@@ posing to kill thee .
until thy brother 's anger turn away from thee , and he forget that which thou hast done to him : then I will send , and fetch thee from th@@ ence : why should I be deprived also of you both in one day ?
and Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah said to Isaac , I am weary of my life because of the daughters of H@@ eth : if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of H@@ eth , such as these which are of the daughters of the land , what good shall my life do me ?
and Isaac called Jacob , and blessed him , and charged him , and said unto him , Th@@ ou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Can@@ a@@ an .
arise , go to Pad@@ an @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am , to the house of Beth@@ u@@ el thy mother 's father ; and take thee a wife from th@@ ence of the daughters of Lab@@ an thy mother 's brother .
and give thee the blessing of Abraham , to thee , and to thy seed with thee ; that thou may@@ est inherit the land where@@ in thou art a stranger , which God gave unto Abraham .
and Isaac sent away Jacob : and he went to Pad@@ an @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am unto Lab@@ an , son of Beth@@ u@@ el the Syrian , the brother of Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah , Jacob 's and Es@@ au 's mother .
then went Es@@ au unto I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , and took unto the wives which he had Ma@@ hal@@ ath the daughter of I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el Abraham 's son , the sister of Ne@@ ba@@ jo@@ th , to be his wife .
and he lighted upon a certain place , and tar@@ ried there all night , because the sun was set ; and he took of the stones of that place , and put them for his pil@@ lows , and lay down in that place to sleep .
and , behold , the LORD stood above it , and said , I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father , and the God of Isaac : the land where@@ on thou li@@ est , to thee will I give it , and to thy seed ;
and , behold , I am with thee , and will keep thee in all places whi@@ ther thou go@@ est , and will bring thee again into this land ; for I will not leave thee , until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of .
and Jacob aw@@ aked out of his sleep , and he said , Su@@ rely the LORD is in this place ; and I knew it not .
and he was afraid , and said , How dreadful is this place ! this is none other but the house of God , and this is the gate of heaven .
and Jacob rose up early in the morning , and took the stone that he had put for his pil@@ lows , and set it up for a pillar , and poured oil upon the top of it .
and he called the name of that place Be@@ the@@ l : but the name of that city was called Lu@@ z at the first .
and Jacob vowed a vo@@ w , saying , If God will be with me , and will keep me in this way that I go , and will give me bread to eat , and ra@@ iment to put on ,
and he looked , and behold a well in the field , and , lo , there were three f@@ locks of sheep lying by it ; for out of that well they wat@@ ered the f@@ locks : and a great stone was upon the well 's mouth .
and thi@@ ther were all the f@@ locks gathered : and they rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and wat@@ ered the sheep , and put the stone again upon the well 's mouth in his place .
and they said , We C@@ AN@@ NOT , until all the f@@ locks be gathered together , and till they roll the stone from the well 's mouth ; then we water the sheep .
and it came to pass , when Jacob saw Rach@@ el the daughter of Lab@@ an his mother 's brother , and the sheep of Lab@@ an his mother 's brother , that Jacob went near , and rolled the stone from the well 's mouth , and wat@@ ered the flock of Lab@@ an his mother 's brother .
and it came to pass , when Lab@@ an heard the ti@@ dings of Jacob his sister 's son , that he ran to meet him , and embraced him , and kis@@ sed him , and brought him to his house . and he told Lab@@ an all these things .
and Lab@@ an had two daughters : the name of the elder was Le@@ ah , and the name of the younger was Rach@@ el .
and Lab@@ an said , It is better that I give her to thee , than that I should give her to another man : abide with me .
and it came to pass , that in the morning , behold , it was Le@@ ah : and he said to Lab@@ an , What is this thou hast done unto me ? did not I serve with thee for Rach@@ el ? W@@ herefore then hast thou be@@ gu@@ iled me ?
and Lab@@ an said , It must not be so done in our country , to give the younger before the fir@@ st@@ born .
and Le@@ ah conceived , and bare a son , and she called his name Re@@ ub@@ en : for she said , Su@@ rely the LORD hath looked upon my afflic@@ tion ; now therefore my husband will love me .
and she conceived again , and bare a son ; and said , Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated , he hath therefore given me this son also : and she called his name Sim@@ eon .
and Rach@@ el said , God hath judged me , and hath also heard my voice , and hath given me a son : therefore called she his name Dan .
and Re@@ ub@@ en went in the days of wheat harvest , and found man@@ dr@@ akes in the field , and brought them unto his mother Le@@ ah . then Rach@@ el said to Le@@ ah , Gi@@ ve me , I pray thee , of thy son 's man@@ dr@@ akes .
and she said unto her , Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband ? and w@@ oul@@ dest thou take away my son 's man@@ dr@@ akes also ? and Rach@@ el said , T@@ herefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son 's man@@ dr@@ akes .
and Jacob came out of the field in the evening , and Le@@ ah went out to meet him , and said , Th@@ ou must come in unto me ; for surely I have hired thee with my son 's man@@ dr@@ akes . and he lay with her that night .
and it came to pass , when Rach@@ el had born Joseph , that Jacob said unto Lab@@ an , Send me away , that I may go unto mine own place , and to my country .
and Lab@@ an said unto him , I pray thee , if I have found favour in th@@ ine eyes , tar@@ ry : for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake .
I will pass through all thy flock to day , removing from th@@ ence all the spec@@ k@@ led and spotted cattle , and all the brown cattle among the sheep , and the spotted and spec@@ k@@ led among the goats : and of such shall be my hire .
and he removed that day the he goats that were ring@@ str@@ aked and spotted , and all the she goats that were spec@@ k@@ led and spotted , and every one that had some white in it , and all the brown among the sheep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
and Jacob took him rods of green po@@ pl@@ ar , and of the haz@@ el and ch@@ es@@ nut tree ; and p@@ illed white str@@ akes in them , and made the white appear which was in the rods .
and he set the rods which he had p@@ illed before the f@@ locks in the g@@ ut@@ ters in the wat@@ ering tr@@ ough@@ s when the f@@ locks came to drink , that they should conceive when they came to drink .
and the man increased exceedingly , and had much cattle , and mai@@ d@@ servants , and men@@ servants , and cam@@ els , and asses .
and he heard the words of Lab@@ an 's sons , saying , Jacob hath taken away all that was our father 's ; and of that which was our father 's hath he gotten all this glory .
and the LORD said unto Jacob , Return unto the land of thy fathers , and to thy kind@@ red ; and I will be with thee .
I am the God of Be@@ the@@ l , where thou ano@@ int@@ ed@@ st the pillar , and where thou vow@@ ed@@ st a vo@@ w unto me : now arise , get thee out from this land , and return unto the land of thy kind@@ red .
for all the riches which God hath taken from our father , that is ours , and our children 's : now then , whatsoever God hath said unto thee , do .
and he carried away all his cattle , and all his goods which he had gotten , the cattle of his getting , which he had gotten in Pad@@ an @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am , for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
so he fled with all that he had ; and he rose up , and passed over the river , and set his face toward the mount Gil@@ e@@ ad .
and God came to Lab@@ an the Syrian in a dream by night , and said unto him , Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad .
and Lab@@ an said to Jacob , What hast thou done , that thou hast stolen away un@@ awa@@ res to me , and carried away my daughters , as cap@@ tives taken with the sword ?
W@@ herefore did@@ st thou flee away secretly , and steal away from me ; and did@@ st not tell me , that I might have sent thee away with mir@@ th , and with songs , with tab@@ ret , and with har@@ p ?
and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters ? thou hast now done fool@@ ishly in so doing .
it is in the power of my hand to do you hurt : but the God of your father sp@@ ake unto me yester@@ night , saying , Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad .
and Jacob answered and said to Lab@@ an , Because I was afraid : for I said , Per@@ adventure thou w@@ oul@@ dest take by force thy daughters from me .
with wh@@ om@@ soever thou fin@@ dest thy gods , let him not live : before our brethren discern thou what is th@@ ine with me , and take it to thee . for Jacob knew not that Rach@@ el had stolen them .
and Lab@@ an went into Jacob 's tent , and into Le@@ ah 's tent , and into the two mai@@ d@@ servants ' tents ; but he found them not . then went he out of Le@@ ah 's tent , and entered into Rach@@ el 's tent .
now Rach@@ el had taken the images , and put them in the cam@@ el 's furniture , and sat upon them . and Lab@@ an searched all the tent , but found them not .
and Jacob was w@@ ro@@ th , and CH@@ O@@ DE with Lab@@ an : and Jacob answered and said to Lab@@ an , What is my t@@ resp@@ ass ? what is my sin , that thou hast so ho@@ tly pursued after me ?
this twenty years have I been with thee ; thy ew@@ es and thy she goats have not cast their young , and the r@@ ams of thy flock have I not eaten .
that which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee ; I bare the loss of it ; of my hand did@@ st thou require it , whether stolen by day , or stolen by night .
thus I was ; in the day the drought consumed me , and the frost by night ; and my sleep departed from mine eyes .
and Jacob said unto his brethren , G@@ ather stones ; and they took stones , and made an heap : and they did eat there upon the heap .
then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount , and called his brethren to eat bread : and they did eat bread , and tar@@ ried all night in the mount .
and when Jacob saw them , he said , This is God 's host : and he called the name of that place Ma@@ han@@ aim .
and he commanded them , saying , Th@@ us shall ye speak unto my lord Es@@ au ; Th@@ y servant Jacob sa@@ ith thus , I have so@@ jour@@ ned with Lab@@ an , and stayed there until now :
then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed : and he divided the people that was with him , and the f@@ locks , and herds , and the cam@@ els , into two bands ;
and said , If Es@@ au come to the one company , and sm@@ ite it , then the other company which is left shall escape .
and Jacob said , O God of my father Abraham , and God of my father Isaac , the LORD which s@@ ai@@ d@@ st unto me , Return unto thy country , and to thy kind@@ red , and I will deal well with thee :
deliver me , I pray thee , from the hand of my brother , from the hand of Es@@ au : for I fear him , lest he will come and sm@@ ite me , and the mother with the children .
and thou s@@ ai@@ d@@ st , I will surely do thee good , and make thy seed as the sand of the sea , which C@@ AN@@ NOT be numbered for multitude .
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants , every drove by themselves ; and said unto his servants , Pass over before me , and put a space bet@@ wi@@ x@@ t drove and drove .
then thou shalt say , They be thy servant Jacob 's ; it is a present sent unto my lord Es@@ au : and , behold , also he is behind us .
and so commanded he the second , and the third , and all that followed the dro@@ ves , saying , On this manner shall ye speak unto Es@@ au , when ye find him .
and Jacob was left alone ; and there wrest@@ led a man with him until the breaking of the day .
and when he saw that he prevailed not against him , he touched the hollow of his thi@@ gh ; and the hollow of Jacob 's thi@@ gh was out of joint , as he wrest@@ led with him .
and he said , Let me go , for the day break@@ eth . and he said , I will not let thee go , except thou bless me .
and he said , Th@@ y name shall be called no more Jacob , but Israel : for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men , and hast prevailed .
and Jacob asked him , and said , Tell me , I pray thee , thy name . and he said , W@@ herefore is it that thou d@@ ost ask after my name ? and he blessed him there .
and he passed over before them , and bowed himself to the ground seven times , until he came near to his brother .
and Jacob said , N@@ ay , I pray thee , if now I have found grace in thy sight , then receive my present at my hand : for therefore I have seen thy face , as though I had seen the face of God , and thou w@@ ast pleased with me .
take , I pray thee , my blessing that is brought to thee ; because God hath dealt gr@@ aci@@ ously with me , and because I have enough . and he urged him , and he took it .
and he said unto him , My lord know@@ eth that the children are tender , and the f@@ locks and herds with young are with me : and if men should over@@ drive them one day , all the flock will die .
let my lord , I pray thee , pass over before his servant : and I will lead on softly , according as the cattle that go@@ eth before me and the children be able to endure , until I come unto my lord unto Se@@ ir .
and Es@@ au said , Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me . and he said , What need@@ eth it ? let me find grace in the sight of my lord .
and the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it : and the men were griev@@ ed , and they were very w@@ ro@@ th , because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob 's daughter ; which thing ought not to be done .
ask me never so much d@@ ow@@ ry and gift , and I will give according as ye shall say unto me : but give me the dam@@ sel to wife .
and they said unto them , We C@@ AN@@ NOT do this thing , to give our sister to one that is un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised ; for that were a repro@@ ach unto us :
then will we give our daughters unto you , and we will take your daughters to us , and we will dwell with you , and we will become one people .
but if ye will not hear@@ ken unto us , to be circum@@ c@@ ised ; then will we take our daughter , and we will be gone .
and the young man deferred not to do the thing , because he had delight in Jacob 's daughter : and he was more hon@@ our@@ able than all the house of his father .
these men are peace@@ able with us ; therefore let them dwell in the land , and trade therein ; for the land , behold , it is large enough for them ; let us take their daughters to us for wives , and let us give them our daughters .
and unto Ham@@ or and unto Sh@@ ec@@ hem his son hear@@ k@@ ened all that went out of the gate of his city ; and every male was circum@@ c@@ ised , all that went out of the gate of his city .
and it came to pass on the third day , when they were sore , that two of the sons of Jacob , Sim@@ eon and Lev@@ i , Din@@ ah 's brethren , took each man his sword , and came upon the city boldly , and sle@@ w all the males .
and they sle@@ w Ham@@ or and Sh@@ ec@@ hem his son with the edge of the sword , and took Din@@ ah out of Sh@@ ec@@ hem 's house , and went out .
the sons of Jacob came upon the sl@@ ain , and spoiled the city , because they had de@@ filed their sister .
and God said unto Jacob , A@@ rise , go up to Be@@ the@@ l , and dwell there : and make there an altar unto God , that appeared unto thee when thou fle@@ dd@@ est from the face of Es@@ au thy brother .
then Jacob said unto his household , and to all that were with him , P@@ ut away the strange gods that are among you , and be clean , and change your garments :
and let us arise , and go up to Be@@ the@@ l ; and I will make there an altar unto God , who answered me in the day of my distress , and was with me in the way which I went .
and he built there an altar , and called the place El @@@ -@@ @ B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ el : because there God appeared unto him , when he fled from the face of his brother .
but De@@ bor@@ ah Re@@ be@@ k@@ ah 's nurse died , and she was buried beneath Be@@ the@@ l under an oak : and the name of it was called Al@@ lon @@@ -@@ @ b@@ ach@@ u@@ th .
and God appeared unto Jacob again , when he came out of Pad@@ an @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am , and blessed him .
and God said unto him , I am God Almighty : be fruitful and multiply ; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee , and kings shall come out of thy lo@@ ins ;
and the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac , to thee I will give it , and to thy seed after thee will I give the land .
and Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him , even a pillar of stone : and he poured a drink offering there@@ on , and he poured oil there@@ on .
and it came to pass , when she was in hard labour , that the mid@@ wife said unto her , Fe@@ ar not ; thou shalt have this son also .
and Jacob set a pillar upon her grave : that is the pillar of Rach@@ el 's grave unto this day .
and it came to pass , when Israel d@@ wel@@ t in that land , that Re@@ ub@@ en went and lay with Bil@@ ha@@ h his father 's conc@@ ub@@ ine : and Israel heard it . now the sons of Jacob were twelve :
the sons of Le@@ ah ; Re@@ ub@@ en , Jacob 's fir@@ st@@ born , and Sim@@ eon , and Lev@@ i , and Jud@@ ah , and Is@@ sac@@ har , and Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n :
Es@@ au took his wives of the daughters of Can@@ a@@ an ; Ad@@ ah the daughter of El@@ on the Hit@@ tite , and A@@ hol@@ i@@ bam@@ ah the daughter of An@@ ah the daughter of Zi@@ be@@ on the Hi@@ v@@ ite ;
these are the names of Es@@ au 's sons ; Eli@@ p@@ haz the son of Ad@@ ah the wife of Es@@ au , Re@@ u@@ el the son of Bash@@ em@@ ath the wife of Es@@ au .
and Tim@@ na was conc@@ ub@@ ine to Eli@@ p@@ haz Es@@ au 's son ; and she bare to Eli@@ p@@ haz A@@ mal@@ ek : these were the sons of Ad@@ ah Es@@ au 's wife .
and these are the sons of Re@@ u@@ el ; N@@ ah@@ ath , and Zer@@ ah , Sham@@ ma@@ h , and M@@ iz@@ z@@ ah : these were the sons of Bash@@ em@@ ath Es@@ au 's wife .
and these were the sons of A@@ hol@@ i@@ bam@@ ah , the daughter of An@@ ah the daughter of Zi@@ be@@ on , Es@@ au 's wife : and she bare to Es@@ au Je@@ ush , and Ja@@ al@@ am , and Kor@@ ah .
these were du@@ kes of the sons of Es@@ au : the sons of Eli@@ p@@ haz the fir@@ st@@ born son of Es@@ au ; du@@ ke Tem@@ an , du@@ ke Omar , du@@ ke Z@@ eph@@ o , du@@ ke Ken@@ az ,
and these are the sons of Re@@ u@@ el Es@@ au 's son ; du@@ ke N@@ ah@@ ath , du@@ ke Zer@@ ah , du@@ ke Sham@@ ma@@ h , du@@ ke M@@ iz@@ z@@ ah : these are the du@@ kes that came of Re@@ u@@ el in the land of E@@ dom ; these are the sons of Bash@@ em@@ ath Es@@ au 's wife .
and these are the sons of A@@ hol@@ i@@ bam@@ ah Es@@ au 's wife ; du@@ ke Je@@ ush , du@@ ke Ja@@ al@@ am , du@@ ke Kor@@ ah : these were the du@@ kes that came of A@@ hol@@ i@@ bam@@ ah the daughter of An@@ ah , Es@@ au 's wife .
these are the sons of Se@@ ir the Hor@@ ite , who inhabited the land ; Lot@@ an , and Sho@@ bal , and Zi@@ be@@ on , and An@@ ah ,
and the children of Sho@@ bal were these ; Al@@ van , and Man@@ ah@@ ath , and E@@ bal , Sh@@ eph@@ o , and On@@ am .
and these are the children of Zi@@ be@@ on ; both Aj@@ ah , and An@@ ah : this was that An@@ ah that found the mul@@ es in the wilderness , as he fed the asses of Zi@@ be@@ on his father .
these are the du@@ kes that came of the Hor@@ ites ; du@@ ke Lot@@ an , du@@ ke Sho@@ bal , du@@ ke Zi@@ be@@ on , du@@ ke An@@ ah ,
Duke D@@ ish@@ on , du@@ ke E@@ zer , du@@ ke D@@ ish@@ an : these are the du@@ kes that came of Hor@@ i , among their du@@ kes in the land of Se@@ ir .
and Hus@@ ham died , and had@@ ad the son of Bed@@ ad , who smo@@ te Mi@@ dian in the field of Mo@@ ab , re@@ igned in his stead : and the name of his city was Av@@ ith .
and Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ Han@@ an the son of Ach@@ b@@ or died , and Had@@ ar re@@ igned in his stead : and the name of his city was P@@ au ; and his wife 's name was Me@@ het@@ ab@@ el , the daughter of Mat@@ red , the daughter of Me@@ z@@ a@@ hab .
and these are the names of the du@@ kes that came of Es@@ au , according to their families , after their places , by their names ; du@@ ke Tim@@ n@@ ah , du@@ ke Al@@ v@@ ah , du@@ ke Je@@ the@@ th ,
Duke Mag@@ di@@ el , du@@ ke I@@ ram : these be the du@@ kes of E@@ dom , according to their hab@@ itations in the land of their possession : he is Es@@ au the father of the E@@ dom@@ ites .
now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children , because he was the son of his old age : and he made him a coat of many colours .
for , behold , we were binding she@@ aves in the field , and , lo , my she@@ af arose , and also stood upright ; and , behold , your she@@ aves stood round about , and made obe@@ is@@ ance to my she@@ af .
and his brethren said to him , shalt thou indeed reign over us ? or shalt thou indeed have dom@@ inion over us ? and they hated him yet the more for his dreams , and for his words .
and he dreamed yet another dream , and told it his brethren , and said , Be@@ hold , I have dreamed a dream more ; and , behold , the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obe@@ is@@ ance to me .
and Israel said unto Joseph , Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Sh@@ ec@@ hem ? come , and I will send thee unto them . and he said to him , Here am I.
and he said to him , Go , I pray thee , see whether it be well with thy brethren , and well with the f@@ locks ; and bring me word again . so he sent him out of the val@@ e of He@@ br@@ on , and he came to Sh@@ ec@@ hem .
and a certain man found him , and , behold , he was wandering in the field : and the man asked him , saying , What see@@ k@@ est thou ?
and he said , I seek my brethren : tell me , I pray thee , where they feed their f@@ locks .
come now therefore , and let us sl@@ ay him , and cast him into some pit , and we will say , Some evil beast hath dev@@ oured him : and we shall see what will become of his dreams .
and Re@@ ub@@ en heard it , and he delivered him out of their hands ; and said , Let us not kill him .
and it came to pass , when Joseph was come unto his brethren , that they stri@@ pt Joseph out of his coat , his coat of many colours that was on him ;
and they sat down to eat bread : and they lifted up their eyes and looked , and , behold , a company of I@@ sh@@ me@@ elites came from Gil@@ e@@ ad with their cam@@ els bearing sp@@ ic@@ ery and bal@@ m and my@@ rr@@ h , going to carry it down to Egypt .
come , and let us sell him to the I@@ sh@@ me@@ elites , and let not our hand be upon him ; for he is our brother and our flesh . and his brethren were content .
then there passed by Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites merchan@@ t@@ men ; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit , and sold Joseph to the I@@ sh@@ me@@ elites for twenty pieces of silver : and they brought Joseph into Egypt .
and they sent the coat of many colours , and they brought it to their father ; and said , This have we found : know now whether it be thy son 's coat or no .
and he knew it , and said , It is my son 's coat ; an evil beast hath dev@@ oured him ; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces .
and all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him ; but he refused to be comfor@@ ted ; and he said , For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning . thus his father we@@ pt for him .
and Jud@@ ah saw there a daughter of a certain Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , whose name was Shu@@ ah ; and he took her , and went in unto her .
and she yet again conceived , and bare a son ; and called his name Shel@@ ah : and he was at Ch@@ ez@@ ib , when she bare him .
and E@@ r , Jud@@ ah 's fir@@ st@@ born , was wicked in the sight of the LORD ; and the LORD sle@@ w him .
and On@@ an knew that the seed should not be his ; and it came to pass , when he went in unto his brother 's wife , that he spilled it on the ground , lest that he should give seed to his brother .
and he said , I will send thee a kid from the flock . and she said , Wil@@ t thou give me a pledge , till thou send it ?
and he said , What pledge shall I give thee ? and she said , Th@@ y sig@@ net , and thy brac@@ elets , and thy staff that is in th@@ ine hand . and he gave it her , and came in unto her , and she conceived by him .
and she arose , and went away , and laid by her V@@ ail from her , and put on the garments of her wi@@ do@@ wh@@ ood .
and Jud@@ ah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Ad@@ ul@@ lam@@ ite , to receive his pledge from the woman 's hand : but he found her not .
then he asked the men of that place , saying , Where is the har@@ lot , that was openly by the way side ? and they said , There was no har@@ lot in this place .
and he returned to Jud@@ ah , and said , I C@@ AN@@ NOT find her ; and also the men of the place said , that there was no har@@ lot in this place .
and Jud@@ ah acknowledged them , and said , She hath been more righteous than I ; because that I gave her not to Shel@@ ah my son . and he knew her again no more .
and it came to pass , when she tr@@ avail@@ ed , that the one put out his hand : and the mid@@ wife took and bound upon his hand a scar@@ let thread , saying , This came out first ,
and afterward came out his brother , that had the scar@@ let thread upon his hand : and his name was called Zar@@ ah .
and the LORD was with Joseph , and he was a prosperous man ; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian .
and it came to pass from the time that he had made him over@@ se@@ er in his house , and over all that he had , that the LORD blessed the Egyptian 's house for Joseph 's sake ; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house , and in the field .
there is none greater in this house than I ; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee , because thou art his wife : how then can I do this great w@@ ick@@ edness , and sin against God ?
and it came to pass , as she sp@@ ake to Joseph day by day , that he hear@@ k@@ ened not unto her , to lie by her , or to be with her .
and it came to pass about this time , that Joseph went into the house to do his business ; and there was none of the men of the house there within .
and it came to pass , when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand , and was fled forth ,
that she called unto the men of her house , and sp@@ ake unto them , saying , See , he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mo@@ ck us ; he came in unto me to lie with me , and I cried with a loud voice :
and it came to pass , when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled , and got him out .
and she sp@@ ake unto him according to these words , saying , The Hebrew servant , which thou hast brought unto us , came in unto me to mo@@ ck me :
and it came to pass , as I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled out .
and it came to pass , when his master heard the words of his wife , which she sp@@ ake unto him , saying , After this manner did thy servant to me ; that his wrath was kind@@ led .
and Joseph 's master took him , and put him into the prison , a place where the king 's prisoners were bound : and he was there in the prison .
and the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph 's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison ; and whatsoever they did there , he was the do@@ er of it .
and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard , into the prison , the place where Joseph was bound .
and Joseph came in unto them in the morning , and looked upon them , and , behold , they were sad .
and the chief but@@ ler told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , In my dream , behold , a vine was before me ;
and Phar@@ aoh 's cup was in my hand : and I took the grapes , and pressed them into Phar@@ aoh 's cup , and I gave the cup into Phar@@ aoh 's hand .
but think on me when it shall be well with thee , and sh@@ ew kindness , I pray thee , unto me , and make mention of me unto Phar@@ aoh , and bring me out of this house :
for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the He@@ bre@@ ws : and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dun@@ geon .
when the chief b@@ aker saw that the interpretation was good , he said unto Joseph , I also was in my dream , and , behold , I had three white bas@@ kets on my head :
and in the up@@ per@@ most basket there was of all manner of bak@@ em@@ eats for Phar@@ aoh ; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head .
yet within three days shall Phar@@ aoh lift up thy head from off thee , and shall hang thee on a tree ; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee .
and , behold , seven other k@@ ine came up after them out of the river , ill fav@@ oured and lean@@ fl@@ es@@ hed ; and stood by the other k@@ ine upon the brink of the river .
and the seven thin ears dev@@ oured the seven rank and full ears . and Phar@@ aoh aw@@ oke , and , behold , it was a dream .
and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled ; and he sent and called for all the mag@@ icians of Egypt , and all the wise men thereof : and Phar@@ aoh told them his dream ; but there was none that could interpret them unto Phar@@ aoh .
and we dreamed a dream in one night , I and he ; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream .
and it came to pass , as he interpreted to us , so it was ; me he restored unto mine office , and him he han@@ ged .
then Phar@@ aoh sent and called Joseph , and they brought him hastily out of the dun@@ geon : and he sha@@ ved himself , and changed his ra@@ iment , and came in unto Phar@@ aoh .
and Phar@@ aoh said unto Joseph , I have dreamed a dream , and there is none that can interpret it : and I have heard say of thee , that thou can@@ st understand a dream to interpret it .
and , behold , there came up out of the river seven k@@ ine , fat@@ fl@@ es@@ hed and well fav@@ oured ; and they fed in a me@@ adow :
and , behold , seven ears , with@@ ered , thin , and b@@ lasted with the east wind , sp@@ run@@ g up after them :
and Joseph said unto Phar@@ aoh , The dream of Phar@@ aoh is one : God hath sh@@ ew@@ ed Phar@@ aoh what he is about to do .
this is the thing which I have spoken unto Phar@@ aoh : what God is about to do he sh@@ ew@@ eth unto Phar@@ aoh .
and for that the dream was doubled unto Phar@@ aoh twice ; it is because the thing is established by God , and God will shortly bring it to pass .
and let them gather all the food of those good years that come , and lay up corn under the hand of Phar@@ aoh , and let them keep food in the cities .
and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine , which shall be in the land of Egypt ; that the land perish not through the famine .
thou shalt be over my house , and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled : only in the throne will I be greater than thou .
and Phar@@ aoh took off his ring from his hand , and put it upon Joseph 's hand , and ar@@ ra@@ yed him in vest@@ ures of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck ;
and Phar@@ aoh called Joseph 's name Zap@@ hn@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ pa@@ an@@ e@@ ah ; and he gave him to wife A@@ sen@@ ath the daughter of Pot@@ i @@@ -@@ @ ph@@ er@@ ah priest of On . and Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt .
and unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came , which A@@ sen@@ ath the daughter of Pot@@ i @@@ -@@ @ ph@@ er@@ ah priest of On bare unto him .
and Joseph called the name of the fir@@ st@@ born Man@@ as@@ se@@ h : for God , said he , hath made me forget all my to@@ il , and all my father 's house .
and the seven years of pl@@ ent@@ e@@ ousness , that was in the land of Egypt , were ended .
and the seven years of de@@ ar@@ th began to come , according as Joseph had said : and the de@@ ar@@ th was in all lands ; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread .
and the famine was over all the face of the earth : and Joseph opened all the store@@ houses , and sold unto the Egyptians ; and the famine wa@@ xed sore in the land of Egypt .
and he said , Be@@ hold , I have heard that there is corn in Egypt : get you down thi@@ ther , and buy for us from th@@ ence ; that we may live , and not die .
and Joseph saw his brethren , and he knew them , but made himself strange unto them , and sp@@ ake roughly unto them ; and he said unto them , wh@@ ence come ye ? and they said , From the land of Can@@ a@@ an to buy food .
and Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them , and said unto them , Y@@ e are spies ; to see the n@@ ak@@ edness of the land ye are come .
and they said , Th@@ y servants are twelve brethren , the sons of one man in the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; and , behold , the youngest is this day with our father , and one is not .
send one of you , and let him fetch your brother , and ye shall be kept in prison , that your words may be proved , whether there be any truth in you : or else by the life of Phar@@ aoh surely ye are spies .
and they said one to another , We are verily guilty concerning our brother , in that we saw the angu@@ ish of his soul , when he bes@@ ought us , and we would not hear ; therefore is this distress come upon us .
and Re@@ ub@@ en answered them , saying , sp@@ ake I not unto you , saying , Do not sin against the child ; and ye would not hear ? therefore , behold , also his blood is required .
then Joseph commanded to fill their s@@ acks with corn , and to restore every man 's money into his sack , and to give them provision for the way : and thus did he unto them .
and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass pro@@ ven@@ der in the inn , he es@@ pied his money ; for , behold , it was in his sack 's mouth .
and he said unto his brethren , My money is restored ; and , lo , it is even in my sack : and their heart failed them , and they were afraid , saying one to another , What is this that God hath done unto us ?
we be twelve brethren , sons of our father ; one is not , and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
and bring your youngest brother unto me : then shall I know that ye are no spies , but that ye are true men : so will I deliver you your brother , and ye shall traff@@ ick in the land .
and it came to pass as they emp@@ tied their s@@ acks , that , behold , every man 's bundle of money was in his sack : and when both they and their father saw the bun@@ dles of money , they were afraid .
and Re@@ ub@@ en sp@@ ake unto his father , saying , S@@ lay my two sons , if I bring him not to thee : deliver him into my hand , and I will bring him to thee again .
and he said , My son shall not go down with you ; for his brother is dead , and he is left alone : if mis@@ chief be@@ fall him by the way in the which ye go , then shall ye bring down my gray ha@@ irs with sorrow to the grave .
and it came to pass , when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt , their father said unto them , Go again , buy us a little food .
and Jud@@ ah said unto Israel his father , Send the l@@ ad with me , and we will arise and go ; that we may live , and not die , both we , and thou , and also our little ones .
and take double money in your hand ; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your s@@ acks , carry it again in your hand ; per@@ adventure it was an oversight :
and they came near to the ste@@ ward of Joseph 's house , and they commun@@ ed with him at the door of the house ,
and it came to pass , when we came to the inn , that we opened our s@@ acks , and , behold , every man 's money was in the mouth of his sack , our money in full weight : and we have brought it again in our hand .
and he said , Peace be to you , fear not : your God , and the God of your father , hath given you treasure in your s@@ acks : I had your money . and he brought Sim@@ eon out unto them .
and he asked them of their welfare , and said , Is your father well , the old man of whom ye sp@@ ake ? is he yet alive ?
and he washed his face , and went out , and ref@@ rained himself , and said , Set on bread .
and they set on for him by himself , and for them by themselves , and for the Egyptians , which did eat with him , by themselves : because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the He@@ bre@@ ws ; for that is an ab@@ om@@ ination unto the Egyptians .
and he took and sent m@@ esses unto them from before him : but Benjamin 's mess was five times so much as any of theirs . and they drank , and were mer@@ ry with him .
and he commanded the ste@@ ward of his house , saying , F@@ ill the men 's s@@ acks with food , as much as they can carry , and put every man 's money in his sack 's mouth .
and when they were gone out of the city , and not yet far off , Joseph said unto his ste@@ ward , Up , follow after the men ; and when thou d@@ ost over@@ take them , say unto them , W@@ herefore have ye rewarded evil for good ?
behold , the money , which we found in our s@@ acks ' mouths , we brought again unto thee out of the land of Can@@ a@@ an : how then should we steal out of thy lord 's house silver or gold ?
with wh@@ om@@ soever of thy servants it be found , both let him die , and we also will be my lord 's bond@@ men .
and Jud@@ ah said , What shall we say unto my lord ? what shall we speak ? or how shall we clear ourselves ? God hath found out the ini@@ qu@@ ity of thy servants : behold , we are my lord 's servants , both we , and he also with whom the cup is found .
and he said , God forbid that I should do so : but the man in whose hand the cup is found , he shall be my servant ; and as for you , get you up in peace unto your father .
then Jud@@ ah came near unto him , and said , Oh my lord , let thy servant , I pray thee , speak a word in my lord 's ears , and let not th@@ ine anger burn against thy servant : for thou art even as Phar@@ aoh .
and we said unto my lord , We have a father , an old man , and a child of his old age , a little one ; and his brother is dead , and he alone is left of his mother , and his father lov@@ eth him .
and the one went out from me , and I said , Su@@ rely he is torn in pieces ; and I saw him not since :
now therefore when I come to thy servant my father , and the l@@ ad be not with us ; seeing that his life is bound up in the l@@ ad 's life ;
now therefore , I pray thee , let thy servant abide instead of the l@@ ad a bond@@ man to my lord ; and let the l@@ ad go up with his brethren .
then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him ; and he cried , C@@ ause every man to go out from me . and there stood no man with him , while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , Come near to me , I pray you . and they came near . and he said , I am Joseph your brother , whom ye sold into Egypt .
for these two years hath the famine been in the land : and yet there are five years , in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest .
and God sent me before you to preserve you a post@@ er@@ ity in the earth , and to save your lives by a great deliver@@ ance .
so now it was not you that sent me hi@@ ther , but God : and he hath made me a father to Phar@@ aoh , and lord of all his house , and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt .
ha@@ ste ye , and go up to my father , and say unto him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith thy son Joseph , God hath made me lord of all Egypt : come down unto me , tar@@ ry not :
and thou shalt dwell in the land of Gos@@ hen , and thou shalt be near unto me , thou , and thy children , and thy children 's children , and thy f@@ locks , and thy herds , and all that thou hast :
and there will I nour@@ ish thee ; for yet there are five years of famine ; lest thou , and thy household , and all that thou hast , come to poverty .
and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt , and of all that ye have seen ; and ye shall ha@@ ste and bring down my father hi@@ ther .
and Phar@@ aoh said unto Joseph , S@@ ay unto thy brethren , This do ye ; L@@ ade your beasts , and go , get you unto the land of Can@@ a@@ an ;
and take your father and your households , and come unto me : and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt , and ye shall eat the fat of the land .
now thou art commanded , this do ye ; take you w@@ agons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones , and for your wives , and bring your father , and come .
and the children of Israel did so : and Joseph gave them w@@ agons , according to the commandment of Phar@@ aoh , and gave them provision for the way .
and to his father he sent after this manner ; ten asses lad@@ en with the good things of Egypt , and ten she asses lad@@ en with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way .
so he sent his brethren away , and they departed : and he said unto them , See that ye fall not out by the way .
and told him , saying , Joseph is yet alive , and he is governor over all the land of Egypt . and Jacob 's heart fain@@ ted , for he believed them not .
and God sp@@ ake unto Israel in the visions of the night , and said , Jacob , Jacob . and he said , Here am I.
and he said , I am God , the God of thy father : fear not to go down into Egypt ; for I will there make of thee a great nation :
I will go down with thee into Egypt ; and I will also surely bring thee up again : and Joseph shall put his hand upon th@@ ine eyes .
and Jacob rose up from Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba : and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father , and their little ones , and their wives , in the w@@ agons which Phar@@ aoh had sent to carry him .
his sons , and his sons ' sons with him , his daughters , and his sons ' daughters , and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt .
and the sons of Sim@@ eon ; J@@ em@@ u@@ el , and J@@ amin , and O@@ had , and J@@ ach@@ in , and Zo@@ har , and Sha@@ ul the son of a Can@@ a@@ an@@ iti@@ sh woman .
and the sons of Jud@@ ah ; E@@ r , and On@@ an , and Shel@@ ah , and P@@ ha@@ re@@ z , and Zer@@ ah : but E@@ r and On@@ an died in the land of Can@@ a@@ an . and the sons of P@@ ha@@ re@@ z were Hez@@ ron and Ham@@ ul .
these be the sons of Le@@ ah , which she bare unto Jacob in Pad@@ an @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ am , with his daughter Din@@ ah : all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three .
and the sons of G@@ ad ; Zi@@ p@@ hion , and H@@ agg@@ i , S@@ hun@@ i , and E@@ z@@ bon , ER@@ I , and A@@ ro@@ di , and A@@ rel@@ i .
and the sons of Ash@@ er ; Jim@@ n@@ ah , and I@@ shu@@ ah , and I@@ su@@ i , and B@@ eri@@ ah , and Ser@@ ah their sister : and the sons of B@@ eri@@ ah ; He@@ ber , and Mal@@ chi@@ el .
these are the sons of Z@@ il@@ pa@@ h , whom Lab@@ an gave to Le@@ ah his daughter , and these she bare unto Jacob , even sixteen souls .
and unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Man@@ as@@ se@@ h and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , which A@@ sen@@ ath the daughter of Pot@@ i @@@ -@@ @ ph@@ er@@ ah priest of On bare unto him .
and the sons of Benjamin were Bel@@ ah , and Bec@@ her , and Ash@@ bel , Ger@@ a , and Na@@ aman , E@@ hi , and Ros@@ h , M@@ up@@ pi@@ m , and H@@ up@@ pi@@ m , and Ar@@ d .
these are the sons of Rach@@ el , which were born to Jacob : all the souls were fourteen .
these are the sons of Bil@@ ha@@ h , which Lab@@ an gave unto Rach@@ el his daughter , and she bare these unto Jacob : all the souls were seven .
all the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt , which came out of his lo@@ ins , besides Jacob 's sons ' wives , all the souls were thre@@ es@@ core and six ;
and the sons of Joseph , which were born him in Egypt , were two souls : all the souls of the house of Jacob , which came into Egypt , were thre@@ es@@ core and ten .
and Joseph made ready his ch@@ ari@@ ot , and went up to meet Israel his father , to Gos@@ hen , and presented himself unto him ; and he fell on his neck , and we@@ pt on his neck a good while .
and Israel said unto Joseph , Now let me die , since I have seen thy face , because thou art yet alive .
and Joseph said unto his brethren , and unto his father 's house , I will go up , and sh@@ ew Phar@@ aoh , and say unto him , My brethren , and my father 's house , which were in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , are come unto me ;
and the men are shep@@ herds , for their trade hath been to feed cattle ; and they have brought their f@@ locks , and their herds , and all that they have .
that ye shall say , Th@@ y servants ' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now , both we , and also our fathers : that ye may dwell in the land of Gos@@ hen ; for every shepherd is an ab@@ om@@ ination unto the Egyptians .
then Joseph came and told Phar@@ aoh , and said , My father and my brethren , and their f@@ locks , and their herds , and all that they have , are come out of the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; and , behold , they are in the land of Gos@@ hen .
and Phar@@ aoh said unto his brethren , What is your occupation ? and they said unto Phar@@ aoh , Th@@ y servants are shep@@ herds , both we , and also our fathers .
they said moreover unto Phar@@ aoh , For to so@@ jour@@ n in the land are we come ; for thy servants have no past@@ ure for their f@@ locks ; for the famine is sore in the land of Can@@ a@@ an : now therefore , we pray thee , let thy servants dwell in the land of Gos@@ hen .
and Joseph placed his father and his brethren , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Ram@@ eses , as Phar@@ aoh had commanded .
and there was no bread in all the land ; for the famine was very sore , so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Can@@ a@@ an fain@@ ted by reason of the famine .
and Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , for the corn which they bought : and Joseph brought the money into Phar@@ aoh 's house .
and when money failed in the land of Egypt , and in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , all the Egyptians came unto Joseph , and said , Gi@@ ve us bread : for why should we die in thy presence ? for the money fail@@ eth .
and they brought their cattle unto Joseph : and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses , and for the f@@ locks , and for the cattle of the herds , and for the asses : and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year .
and Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Phar@@ aoh ; for the Egyptians sold every man his field , because the famine prevailed over them : so the land became Phar@@ aoh 's .
only the land of the priests bought he not ; for the priests had a portion assigned them of Phar@@ aoh , and did eat their portion which Phar@@ aoh gave them : W@@ herefore they sold not their lands .
then Joseph said unto the people , Be@@ hold , I have bought you this day and your land for Phar@@ aoh : lo , here is seed for you , and ye shall sow the land .
and they said , Th@@ ou hast saved our lives : let us find grace in the sight of my lord , and we will be Phar@@ aoh 's servants .
and Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day , that Phar@@ aoh should have the fifth part ; except the land of the priests only , which became not Phar@@ aoh 's .
but I will lie with my fathers , and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt , and bury me in their bur@@ y@@ ing@@ place . and he said , I will do as thou hast said .
and he said , swear unto me . and he sw@@ are unto him . and Israel bowed himself upon the bed 's head .
and it came to pass after these things , that one told Joseph , Be@@ hold , thy father is sick : and he took with him his two sons , Man@@ as@@ se@@ h and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
and said unto me , Be@@ hold , I will make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , and I will make of thee a multitude of people ; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession .
and now thy two sons , E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt , are mine ; as Re@@ ub@@ en and Sim@@ eon , they shall be mine .
and as for me , when I came from Pad@@ an , Rach@@ el died by me in the land of Can@@ a@@ an in the way , when yet there was but a little way to come unto E@@ phr@@ ath : and I buried her there in the way of E@@ phr@@ ath ; the same is Bethlehem .
now the eyes of Israel were dim for age , so that he could not see . and he brought them near unto him ; and he kis@@ sed them , and embraced them .
and Joseph brought them out from between his knees , and he bowed himself with his face to the earth .
and Joseph took them both , E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im in his right hand toward Israel 's left hand , and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in his left hand toward Israel 's right hand , and brought them near unto him .
and Israel stretched out his right hand , and laid it upon E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im 's head , who was the younger , and his left hand upon Man@@ as@@ se@@ h 's head , guiding his hands wit@@ tingly ; for Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was the fir@@ st@@ born .
the Angel which re@@ deemed me from all evil , bless the lad@@ s ; and let my name be named on them , and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac ; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth .
and Israel said unto Joseph , Be@@ hold , I die : but God shall be with you , and bring you again unto the land of your fathers .
moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren , which I took out of the hand of the A@@ mor@@ ite with my sword and with my bow .
and Jacob called unto his sons , and said , G@@ ather yourselves together , that I may tell you that which shall be@@ fall you in the last days .
Re@@ ub@@ en , thou art my fir@@ st@@ born , my might , and the beginning of my strength , the excell@@ ency of dignity , and the excell@@ ency of power :
O my soul , come not thou into their secret ; unto their assembly , mine honour , be not thou united : for in their anger they sle@@ w a man , and in their self@@ will they di@@ gged down a wall .
cur@@ sed be their anger , for it was fierce ; and their wrath , for it was cruel : I will divide them in Jacob , and sc@@ atter them in Israel .
even by the God of thy father , who shall help thee ; and by the Almighty , who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above , blessings of the deep that li@@ eth under , blessings of the breasts , and of the womb :
all these are the twelve tribes of Israel : and this is it that their father sp@@ ake unto them , and blessed them ; every one according to his blessing he blessed them .
and he charged them , and said unto them , I am to be gathered unto my people : bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of E@@ ph@@ ron the Hit@@ tite ,
in the cave that is in the field of Mach@@ pel@@ ah , which is before Mam@@ re , in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which Abraham bought with the field of E@@ ph@@ ron the Hit@@ tite for a possession of a bur@@ y@@ ing@@ place .
and when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons , he gathered up his feet into the bed , and yielded up the ghost , and was gathered unto his people .
and Joseph went up to bury his father : and with him went up all the servants of Phar@@ aoh , the elders of his house , and all the elders of the land of Egypt ,
and all the house of Joseph , and his brethren , and his father 's house : only their little ones , and their f@@ locks , and their herds , they left in the land of Gos@@ hen .
and they came to the thresh@@ ing@@ floor of At@@ ad , which is beyond Jordan , and there they mour@@ ned with a great and very sore lam@@ entation : and he made a mourning for his father seven days .
and when the inhabitants of the land , the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , saw the mourning in the floor of At@@ ad , they said , This is a griev@@ ous mourning to the Egyptians : W@@ herefore the name of it was called A@@ bel @@@ -@@ @ m@@ iz@@ ra@@ im , which is beyond Jordan .
for his sons carried him into the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and buried him in the cave of the field of Mach@@ pel@@ ah , which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a bur@@ y@@ ing@@ place of E@@ ph@@ ron the Hit@@ tite , before Mam@@ re .
and Joseph returned into Egypt , he , and his brethren , and all that went up with him to bury his father , after he had buried his father .
and Joseph said unto them , Fe@@ ar not : for am I in the place of God ?
but as for you , ye thought evil against me ; but God meant it unto good , to bring to pass , as it is this day , to save much people alive .
now therefore fear ye not : I will nour@@ ish you , and your little ones . and he comfor@@ ted them , and sp@@ ake kindly unto them .
now these are the names of the children of Israel , which came into Egypt ; every man and his household came with Jacob .
and the children of Israel were fruitful , and increased ab@@ und@@ antly , and multiplied , and wa@@ xed exceeding mighty ; and the land was filled with them .
and they made their lives bitter with hard bond@@ age , in mor@@ ter , and in brick , and in all manner of service in the field : all their service , where@@ in they made them serve , was with ri@@ g@@ our .
and the king of Egypt called for the mid@@ wives , and said unto them , Why have ye done this thing , and have saved the men children alive ?
and the woman conceived , and bare a son : and when she saw him that he was a goo@@ dly child , she hid him three months .
and when she could not longer hide him , she took for him an ark of bul@@ r@@ ushes , and da@@ ub@@ ed it with sli@@ me and with pitch , and put the child therein ; and she laid it in the flags by the river 's brink .
and it came to pass in those days , when Moses was grown , that he went out unto his brethren , and looked on their burdens : and he sp@@ ied an Egyptian sm@@ iting an Hebrew , one of his brethren .
and when he went out the second day , behold , two men of the He@@ bre@@ ws stro@@ ve together : and he said to him that did the wrong , W@@ herefore sm@@ it@@ est thou thy fellow ?
and he said , Who made thee a prince and a judge over us ? inten@@ dest thou to kill me , as thou kil@@ le@@ d@@ st the Egyptian ? and Moses feared , and said , Su@@ rely this thing is known .
now when Phar@@ aoh heard this thing , he sought to sl@@ ay Moses . but Moses fled from the face of Phar@@ aoh , and d@@ wel@@ t in the land of Mi@@ dian : and he sat down by a well .
and he said unto his daughters , And where is he ? why is it that ye have left the man ? call him , that he may eat bread .
and Moses said , I will now turn aside , and see this great sight , why the bush is not burnt .
and when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see , God called unto him out of the midst of the bush , and said , Moses , Moses . and he said , Here am I.
moreover he said , I am the God of thy father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . and Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look upon God .
now therefore , behold , the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me : and I have also seen the oppression where@@ with the Egyptians op@@ press them .
come now therefore , and I will send thee unto Phar@@ aoh , that thou may@@ est bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt .
and he said , Cer@@ tain@@ ly I will be with thee ; and this shall be a token unto thee , that I have sent thee : when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt , ye shall serve God upon this mountain .
and God said unto Moses , I AM THAT I AM : and he said , Th@@ us shalt thou say unto the children of Israel , I AM hath sent me unto you .
go , and gather the elders of Israel together , and say unto them , The LORD God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , of Isaac , and of Jacob , appeared unto me , saying , I have surely visited you , and seen that which is done to you in Egypt :
and I will stretch out my hand , and sm@@ ite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof : and after that he will let you go .
but every woman shall borrow of her neighbour , and of her that so@@ jour@@ neth in her house , jew@@ els of silver , and jew@@ els of gold , and ra@@ iment : and ye shall put them upon your sons , and upon your daughters ; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians .
and Moses answered and said , But , behold , they will not believe me , nor hear@@ ken unto my voice : for they will say , The LORD hath not appeared unto thee .
and he said , C@@ ast it on the ground . and he cast it on the ground , and it became a ser@@ pent ; and Moses fled from before it .
and the LORD said unto Moses , P@@ ut forth th@@ ine hand , and take it by the tail . and he put forth his hand , and caught it , and it became a rod in his hand :
that they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , hath appeared unto thee .
and the LORD said unto him , Who hath made man 's mouth ? or who mak@@ eth the dumb , or deaf , or the seeing , or the blind ? have not I the LORD ?
and thou shalt speak unto him , and put words in his mouth : and I will be with thy mouth , and with his mouth , and will teach you what ye shall do .
and Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them upon an ass , and he returned to the land of Egypt : and Moses took the rod of God in his hand .
and the LORD said unto Moses , When thou go@@ est to return into Egypt , see that thou do all those wonders before Phar@@ aoh , which I have put in th@@ ine hand : but I will har@@ den his heart , that he shall not let the people go .
and I say unto thee , Let my son go , that he may serve me : and if thou refuse to let him go , behold , I will sl@@ ay thy son , even thy fir@@ st@@ born .
then Zi@@ p@@ por@@ ah took a sharp stone , and cut off the fores@@ kin of her son , and cast it at his feet , and said , Su@@ rely a bloody husband art thou to me .
and the LORD said to Aaron , Go into the wilderness to meet Moses . and he went , and met him in the mount of God , and kis@@ sed him .
and Aaron sp@@ ake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses , and did the signs in the sight of the people .
and afterward Moses and Aaron went in , and told Phar@@ aoh , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD God of Israel , Let my people go , that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness .
and Phar@@ aoh said , Who is the LORD , that I should obey his voice to let Israel go ? I know not the LORD , neither will I let Israel go .
and the tale of the bricks , which they did make her@@ et@@ o@@ fore , ye shall lay upon them ; ye shall not diminish ought thereof : for they be idle ; therefore they cry , saying , Let us go and sacrifice to our God .
and the officers of the children of Israel , which Phar@@ aoh 's t@@ ask@@ masters had set over them , were beaten , and demanded , W@@ herefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day , as her@@ et@@ o@@ fore ?
there is no straw given unto thy servants , and they say to us , Make brick : and , behold , thy servants are beaten ; but the fault is in th@@ ine own people .
but he said , Y@@ e are idle , ye are idle : therefore ye say , Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD .
and they said unto them , The LORD look upon you , and judge ; because ye have made our sav@@ our to be ab@@ hor@@ red in the eyes of Phar@@ aoh , and in the eyes of his servants , to put a sword in their hand to sl@@ ay us .
and Moses returned unto the LORD , and said , Lord , where@@ fore hast thou so evil entre@@ ated this people ? why is it that thou hast sent me ?
then the LORD said unto Moses , Now shalt thou see what I will do to Phar@@ aoh : for with a strong hand shall he let them go , and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land .
and I appeared unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob , by the name of God Almighty , but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them .
and I have also established my covenant with them , to give them the land of Can@@ a@@ an , the land of their pilgrimage , where@@ in they were strangers .
and I have also heard the gro@@ aning of the children of Israel , whom the Egyptians keep in bond@@ age ; and I have remembered my covenant .
and I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God : and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God , which br@@ ing@@ eth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
and I will bring you in unto the land , concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob ; and I will give it you for an heritage : I am the LORD .
go in , speak unto Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt , that he let the children of Israel go out of his land .
and Moses sp@@ ake before the LORD , saying , Be@@ hold , the children of Israel have not hear@@ k@@ ened unto me ; how then shall Phar@@ aoh hear me , who am of un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised lips ?
and the LORD sp@@ ake unto Moses and unto Aaron , and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel , and unto Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt , to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt .
and the sons of Sim@@ eon ; J@@ em@@ u@@ el , and J@@ amin , and O@@ had , and J@@ ach@@ in , and Zo@@ har , and Sha@@ ul the son of a Can@@ a@@ an@@ iti@@ sh woman : these are the families of Sim@@ eon .
and the sons of Ko@@ hath ; Am@@ ram , and Iz@@ har , and He@@ br@@ on , and Uz@@ zi@@ el : and the years of the life of Ko@@ hath were an hundred thirty and three years .
and Am@@ ram took him Jo@@ che@@ bed his father 's sister to wife ; and she bare him Aaron and Moses : and the years of the life of Am@@ ram were an hundred and thirty and seven years .
and Ele@@ az@@ ar Aaron 's son took him one of the daughters of P@@ uti@@ el to wife ; and she bare him Ph@@ ine@@ has : these are the heads of the fathers of the Lev@@ ites according to their families .
these are that Aaron and Moses , to whom the LORD said , B@@ ring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies .
these are they which sp@@ ake to Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt , to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt : these are that Moses and Aaron .
that the LORD sp@@ ake unto Moses , saying , I am the LORD : speak thou unto Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee .
and Moses said before the LORD , Be@@ hold , I am of un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised lips , and how shall Phar@@ aoh hear@@ ken unto me ?
but Phar@@ aoh shall not hear@@ ken unto you , that I may lay my hand upon Egypt , and bring forth mine armies , and my people the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt by great judgments .
and the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD , when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt , and bring out the children of Israel from among them .
and Moses and Aaron went in unto Phar@@ aoh , and they did so as the LORD had commanded : and Aaron cast down his rod before Phar@@ aoh , and before his servants , and it became a ser@@ pent .
and he hardened Phar@@ aoh 's heart , that he hear@@ k@@ ened not unto them ; as the LORD had said .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Phar@@ aoh 's heart is hardened , he ref@@ us@@ eth to let the people go .
and thou shalt say unto him , The LORD God of the He@@ bre@@ ws hath sent me unto thee , saying , Let my people go , that they may serve me in the wilderness : and , behold , hitherto thou w@@ oul@@ dest not hear .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD : behold , I will sm@@ ite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river , and they shall be turned to blood .
and the fish that was in the river died ; and the river stan@@ k , and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river ; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the mag@@ icians of Egypt did so with their enchan@@ tments : and Phar@@ aoh 's heart was hardened , neither did he hear@@ ken unto them ; as the LORD had said .
and the LORD sp@@ ake unto Moses , Go unto Phar@@ aoh , and say unto him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
and the LORD sp@@ ake unto Moses , S@@ ay unto Aaron , St@@ ret@@ ch forth th@@ ine hand with thy rod over the streams , over the rivers , and over the pon@@ ds , and cause fro@@ gs to come up upon the land of Egypt .
then Phar@@ aoh called for Moses and Aaron , and said , In@@ treat the LORD , that he may take away the fro@@ gs from me , and from my people ; and I will let the people go , that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD .
and Moses said unto Phar@@ aoh , Glory over me : when shall I int@@ re@@ at for thee , and for thy servants , and for thy people , to destroy the fro@@ gs from thee and thy houses , that they may remain in the river only ?
and he said , To mor@@ row . and he said , Be it according to thy word : that thou may@@ est know that there is none like unto the LORD our God .
and the fro@@ gs shall depart from thee , and from thy houses , and from thy servants , and from thy people ; they shall remain in the river only .
and the LORD said unto Moses , S@@ ay unto Aaron , St@@ ret@@ ch out thy rod , and sm@@ ite the dust of the land , that it may become l@@ ice throughout all the land of Egypt .
and they did so ; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod , and smo@@ te the dust of the earth , and it became l@@ ice in man , and in beast ; all the dust of the land became l@@ ice throughout all the land of Egypt .
and the mag@@ icians did so with their enchan@@ tments to bring forth l@@ ice , but they could not : so there were l@@ ice upon man , and upon beast .
then the mag@@ icians said unto Phar@@ aoh , This is the finger of God : and Phar@@ aoh 's heart was hardened , and he hear@@ k@@ ened not unto them ; as the LORD had said .
and the LORD said unto Moses , R@@ ise up early in the morning , and stand before Phar@@ aoh ; lo , he com@@ eth forth to the water ; and say unto him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
and I will s@@ ever in that day the land of Gos@@ hen , in which my people dwell , that no s@@ war@@ ms of flies shall be there ; to the end thou may@@ est know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth .
and Phar@@ aoh said , I will let you go , that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness ; only ye shall not go very far away : int@@ re@@ at for me .
and Moses said , Be@@ hold , I go out from thee , and I will int@@ re@@ at the LORD that the s@@ war@@ ms of flies may depart from Phar@@ aoh , from his servants , and from his people , to mor@@ row : but let not Phar@@ aoh deal dece@@ it@@ fully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD .
and the LORD did according to the word of Moses ; and he removed the s@@ war@@ ms of flies from Phar@@ aoh , from his servants , and from his people ; there remained not one .
then the LORD said unto Moses , Go in unto Phar@@ aoh , and tell him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD God of the He@@ bre@@ ws , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
behold , the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field , upon the horses , upon the asses , upon the cam@@ els , upon the ox@@ en , and upon the sheep : there shall be a very griev@@ ous mur@@ rain .
and the LORD appointed a set time , saying , To mor@@ row the LORD shall do this thing in the land .
and the LORD did that thing on the mor@@ row , and all the cattle of Egypt died : but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one .
and Phar@@ aoh sent , and , behold , there was not one of the cattle of the Israel@@ ites dead . and the heart of Phar@@ aoh was hardened , and he did not let the people go .
and the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron , Take to you hand@@ ful@@ s of ashes of the furnace , and let Moses sprink@@ le it toward the heaven in the sight of Phar@@ aoh .
and it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt , and shall be a boil breaking forth with bl@@ ains upon man , and upon beast , throughout all the land of Egypt .
and they took ashes of the furnace , and stood before Phar@@ aoh ; and Moses sprink@@ led it up toward heaven ; and it became a boil breaking forth with bl@@ ains upon man , and upon beast .
and the LORD hardened the heart of Phar@@ aoh , and he hear@@ k@@ ened not unto them ; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses .
and the LORD said unto Moses , R@@ ise up early in the morning , and stand before Phar@@ aoh , and say unto him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD God of the He@@ bre@@ ws , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
for now I will stretch out my hand , that I may sm@@ ite thee and thy people with pesti@@ l@@ ence ; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth .
and in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up , for to sh@@ ew in thee my power ; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth .
behold , to mor@@ row about this time I will cause it to rain a very griev@@ ous hail , such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now .
and the LORD said unto Moses , St@@ ret@@ ch forth th@@ ine hand toward heaven , that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt , upon man , and upon beast , and upon every her@@ b of the field , throughout the land of Egypt .
and Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven : and the LORD sent thunder and hail , and the fire ran along upon the ground ; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt .
so there was hail , and fire ming@@ led with the hail , very griev@@ ous , such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation .
and the hail smo@@ te throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field , both man and beast ; and the hail smo@@ te every her@@ b of the field , and brake every tree of the field .
and Moses went out of the city from Phar@@ aoh , and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD : and the th@@ un@@ ders and hail ceased , and the rain was not poured upon the earth .
and when Phar@@ aoh saw that the rain and the hail and the th@@ un@@ ders were ceased , he sin@@ ned yet more , and hardened his heart , he and his servants .
and the heart of Phar@@ aoh was hardened , neither would he let the children of Israel go ; as the LORD had spoken by Moses .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Go in unto Phar@@ aoh : for I have hardened his heart , and the heart of his servants , that I might sh@@ ew these my signs before him :
and that thou may@@ est tell in the ears of thy son , and of thy son 's son , what things I have wrought in Egypt , and my signs which I have done among them ; that ye may know how that I am the LORD .
and Moses and Aaron came in unto Phar@@ aoh , and said unto him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD God of the He@@ bre@@ ws , How long wil@@ t thou refuse to humble thy@@ self before me ? let my people go , that they may serve me .
and Phar@@ aoh 's servants said unto him , How long shall this man be a sn@@ are unto us ? let the men go , that they may serve the LORD their God : know@@ est thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed ?
and Moses said , We will go with our young and with our old , with our sons and with our daughters , with our f@@ locks and with our herds will we go ; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD .
and he said unto them , Let the LORD be so with you , as I will let you go , and your little ones : look to it ; for evil is before you .
not so : go now ye that are men , and serve the LORD ; for that ye did desire . and they were driven out from Phar@@ aoh 's presence .
and the LORD said unto Moses , St@@ ret@@ ch out th@@ ine hand over the land of Egypt for the lo@@ cu@@ sts , that they may come up upon the land of Egypt , and eat every her@@ b of the land , even all that the hail hath left .
and Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt , and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day , and all that night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the lo@@ cu@@ sts .
and the lo@@ cu@@ sts went up over all the land of Egypt , and rested in all the co@@ asts of Egypt : very griev@@ ous were they ; before them there were no such lo@@ cu@@ sts as they , neither after them shall be such .
then Phar@@ aoh called for Moses and Aaron in ha@@ ste ; and he said , I have sin@@ ned against the LORD your God , and against you .
and Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven ; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days :
and Phar@@ aoh called unto Moses , and said , Go ye , serve the LORD ; only let your f@@ locks and your herds be stayed : let your little ones also go with you .
and Moses said , Th@@ ou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings , that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Y@@ et will I bring one plague more upon Phar@@ aoh , and upon Egypt ; afterwards he will let you go hence : when he shall let you go , he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether .
and Moses said , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt :
and all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt shall die , from the fir@@ st@@ born of Phar@@ aoh that sit@@ t@@ eth upon his throne , even unto the fir@@ st@@ born of the mai@@ d@@ servant that is behind the mill ; and all the fir@@ st@@ born of beasts .
but against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue , against man or beast : that ye may know how that the LORD do@@ th put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel .
and all these thy servants shall come down unto me , and bow down themselves unto me , saying , Get thee out , and all the people that follow thee : and after that I will go out . and he went out from Phar@@ aoh in a great anger .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Phar@@ aoh shall not hear@@ ken unto you ; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt .
and Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Phar@@ aoh : and the LORD hardened Phar@@ aoh 's heart , so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land .
your lamb shall be without bl@@ emish , a male of the first year : ye shall take it out from the sheep , or from the goats :
and ye shall keep it up until the four@@ teenth day of the same month : and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening .
and they shall take of the blood , and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses , where@@ in they shall eat it .
eat not of it raw , nor so@@ dden at all with water , but ro@@ ast with fire ; his head with his legs , and with the pur@@ tenance thereof .
and thus shall ye eat it ; with your lo@@ ins gir@@ ded , your shoes on your feet , and your staff in your hand ; and ye shall eat it in ha@@ ste : it is the LORD 's pas@@ sover .
for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night , and will sm@@ ite all the fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt , both man and beast ; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment : I am the LORD .
and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are : and when I see the blood , I will pass over you , and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you , when I sm@@ ite the land of Egypt .
and this day shall be unto you for a memorial ; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations ; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordin@@ ance for ever .
seven days shall ye eat un@@ leav@@ ened bread ; even the first day ye shall put away leav@@ en out of your houses : for wh@@ oso@@ ever e@@ at@@ eth leav@@ ened bread from the first day until the seventh day , that soul shall be cut off from Israel .
and in the first day there shall be an holy convocation , and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you ; no manner of work shall be done in them , save that which every man must eat , that only may be done of you .
seven days shall there be no leav@@ en found in your houses : for wh@@ oso@@ ever e@@ at@@ eth that which is leav@@ ened , even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel , whether he be a stranger , or born in the land .
then Moses called for all the elders of Israel , and said unto them , D@@ raw out and take you a lamb according to your families , and kill the pas@@ sover .
and ye shall take a bunch of h@@ ys@@ so@@ p , and dip it in the blood that is in the bas@@ on , and strike the lin@@ tel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bas@@ on ; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning .
and Phar@@ aoh rose up in the night , he , and all his servants , and all the Egyptians ; and there was a great cry in Egypt ; for there was not a house where there was not one dead .
and he called for Moses and Aaron by night , and said , R@@ ise up , and get you forth from among my people , both ye and the children of Israel ; and go , serve the LORD , as ye have said .
and the Egyptians were urgent upon the people , that they might send them out of the land in ha@@ ste ; for they said , We be all dead men .
and the children of Israel jour@@ ne@@ yed from Ram@@ eses to S@@ uc@@ co@@ th , about six hundred thousand on foot that were men , beside children .
and the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron , This is the ordin@@ ance of the pas@@ sover : there shall no stranger eat thereof :
sancti@@ fy unto me all the fir@@ st@@ born , whatsoever open@@ eth the womb among the children of Israel , both of man and of beast : it is mine .
and Moses said unto the people , Rem@@ ember this day , in which ye came out from Egypt , out of the house of bond@@ age ; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place : there shall no leav@@ ened bread be eaten .
seven days thou shalt eat un@@ leav@@ ened bread , and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD .
and thou shalt sh@@ ew thy son in that day , saying , This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt .
and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon th@@ ine hand , and for a memorial between th@@ ine eyes , that the LORD 's law may be in thy mouth : for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt .
and it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , as he sw@@ are unto thee and to thy fathers , and shall give it thee ,
that thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that open@@ eth the matrix , and every fir@@ st@@ ling that com@@ eth of a beast which thou hast ; the males shall be the LORD 's .
and it shall be for a token upon th@@ ine hand , and for front@@ lets between th@@ ine eyes : for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt .
and Moses took the bones of Joseph with him : for he had stra@@ itly sworn the children of Israel , saying , God will surely visit you ; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you .
and the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud , to lead them the way ; and by night in a pillar of fire , to give them light ; to go by day and night :
for Phar@@ aoh will say of the children of Israel , They are ent@@ angled in the land , the wilderness hath shut them in .
and I will har@@ den Phar@@ aoh 's heart , that he shall follow after them ; and I will be honoured upon Phar@@ aoh , and upon all his host ; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD . and they did so .
and it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled : and the heart of Phar@@ aoh and of his servants was turned against the people , and they said , Why have we done this , that we have let Israel go from serving us ?
and he took six hundred chosen ch@@ ari@@ ots , and all the ch@@ ari@@ ots of Egypt , and cap@@ tains over every one of them .
and the LORD hardened the heart of Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt , and he pursued after the children of Israel : and the children of Israel went out with an high hand .
and they said unto Moses , Because there were no graves in Egypt , hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness ? W@@ herefore hast thou dealt thus with us , to carry us forth out of Egypt ?
is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt , saying , Let us alone , that we may serve the Egyptians ? for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians , than that we should die in the wilderness .
and Moses said unto the people , Fe@@ ar ye not , stand still , and see the salvation of the LORD , which he will sh@@ ew to you to day : for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day , ye shall see them again no more for ever .
and the LORD said unto Moses , W@@ herefore cri@@ est thou unto me ? speak unto the children of Israel , that they go forward :
but lift thou up thy rod , and stretch out th@@ ine hand over the sea , and divide it : and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea .
and the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD , when I have gotten me honour upon Phar@@ aoh , upon his ch@@ ari@@ ots , and upon his hor@@ sem@@ en .
and the angel of God , which went before the camp of Israel , removed and went behind them ; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face , and stood behind them :
and it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel ; and it was a cloud and darkness to them , but it gave light by night to these : so that the one came not near the other all the night .
and the Egyptians pursued , and went in after them to the midst of the sea , even all Phar@@ aoh 's horses , his ch@@ ari@@ ots , and his hor@@ sem@@ en .
and took off their ch@@ ari@@ ot wheels , that they dra@@ ve them heavily : so that the Egyptians said , Let us flee from the face of Israel ; for the LORD fi@@ ght@@ eth for them against the Egyptians .
and the LORD said unto Moses , St@@ ret@@ ch out th@@ ine hand over the sea , that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians , upon their ch@@ ari@@ ots , and upon their hor@@ sem@@ en .
and Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyptians fled against it ; and the LORD over@@ threw the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians ; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore .
the LORD is my strength and song , and he is become my salvation : he is my God , and I will prepare him an hab@@ itation ; my father 's God , and I will ex@@ alt him .
and in the greatness of th@@ ine excell@@ ency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee : thou sent@@ est forth thy wrath , which consumed them as stub@@ ble .
thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast re@@ deemed : thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy hab@@ itation .
fear and dre@@ ad shall fall upon them ; by the greatness of th@@ ine arm they shall be as still as a stone ; till thy people pass over , O LORD , till the people pass over , which thou hast purchased .
thou shalt bring them in , and plant them in the mountain of th@@ ine inheritance , in the place , O LORD , which thou hast made for thee to dwell in , in the Sanc@@ tuary , O Lord , which thy hands have established .
and Mi@@ ri@@ am the proph@@ et@@ ess , the sister of Aaron , took a tim@@ bre@@ l in her hand ; and all the women went out after her with tim@@ b@@ rels and with dances .
and Mi@@ ri@@ am answered them , S@@ ing ye to the LORD , for he hath triumph@@ ed glori@@ ously ; the horse and his ri@@ der hath he thrown into the sea .
so Moses brought Israel from the Red sea , and they went out into the wilderness of Sh@@ ur ; and they went three days in the wilderness , and found no water .
and he cried unto the LORD ; and the LORD sh@@ ew@@ ed him a tree , which when he had cast into the waters , the waters were made sweet : there he made for them a statute and an ordin@@ ance , and there he proved them ,
and they came to Eli@@ m , where were twelve wells of water , and thre@@ es@@ core and ten palm trees : and they enc@@ amped there by the waters .
and they took their journey from Eli@@ m , and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of S@@ in , which is between Eli@@ m and Sinai , on the fif@@ teenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt .
and it shall come to pass , that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in ; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily .
and Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel , At even , then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt :
and in the morning , then ye shall see the glory of the LORD ; for that he he@@ areth your mur@@ mur@@ ings against the LORD : and what are we , that ye mur@@ mur against us ?
and Moses sp@@ ake unto Aaron , S@@ ay unto all the congregation of the children of Israel , Come near before the LORD : for he hath heard your mur@@ mur@@ ings .
and when the children of Israel saw it , they said one to another , It is man@@ na : for they w@@ ist not what it was . and Moses said unto them , This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat .
this is the thing which the LORD hath commanded , G@@ ather of it every man according to his eating , an O@@ mer for every man , according to the number of your persons ; take ye every man for them which are in his tents .
and Moses said , E@@ at that to day ; for to day is a sab@@ bath unto the LORD : to day ye shall not find it in the field .
six days ye shall gather it ; but on the seventh day , which is the sab@@ bath , in it there shall be none .
see , for that the LORD hath given you the sab@@ bath , therefore he gi@@ v@@ eth you on the sixth day the bread of two days ; abide ye every man in his place , let no man go out of his place on the seventh day .
and the house of Israel called the name thereof M@@ anna : and it was like cor@@ i@@ ander seed , white ; and the taste of it was like w@@ af@@ ers made with honey .
and Moses said , This is the thing which the LORD comman@@ det@@ h , F@@ ill an O@@ mer of it to be kept for your generations ; that they may see the bread where@@ with I have fed you in the wilderness , when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt .
and the children of Israel did eat man@@ na forty years , until they came to a land inhabited ; they did eat man@@ na , until they came unto the borders of the land of Can@@ a@@ an .
W@@ herefore the people did chi@@ de with Moses , and said , Gi@@ ve us water that we may drink . and Moses said unto them , Why chi@@ de ye with me ? W@@ herefore do ye temp@@ t the LORD ?
and the people thir@@ sted there for water ; and the people mur@@ mu@@ red against Moses , and said , W@@ herefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst ?
behold , I will stand before thee there upon the rock in H@@ ore@@ b ; and thou shalt sm@@ ite the rock , and there shall come water out of it , that the people may drink . and Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel .
and he called the name of the place Mass@@ ah , and M@@ eri@@ ba@@ h , because of the chi@@ ding of the children of Israel , and because they tempted the LORD , saying , Is the LORD among us , or not ?
and Moses said unto Joshua , Choose us out men , and go out , fight with A@@ mal@@ ek : to mor@@ row I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand .
so Joshua did as Moses had said to him , and fought with A@@ mal@@ ek : and Moses , Aaron , and H@@ ur went up to the top of the hill .
and it came to pass , when Moses held up his hand , that Israel prevailed : and when he let down his hand , A@@ mal@@ ek prevailed .
when Je@@ thr@@ o , the priest of Mi@@ dian , Moses ' father in law , heard of all that God had done for Moses , and for Israel his people , and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt ;
and her two sons ; of which the name of the one was Ger@@ sh@@ om ; for he said , I have been an alien in a strange land :
and the name of the other was Eli@@ ez@@ er ; for the God of my father , said he , was mine help , and delivered me from the sword of Phar@@ aoh :
and Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Phar@@ aoh and to the Egyptians for Israel 's sake , and all the trav@@ ail that had come upon them by the way , and how the LORD delivered them .
and Je@@ thr@@ o rejo@@ iced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel , whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians .
and Je@@ thr@@ o said , Bless@@ ed be the LORD , who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of Phar@@ aoh , who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians .
and when Moses ' father in law saw all that he did to the people , he said , What is this thing that thou do@@ est to the people ? why sit@@ test thou thy@@ self alone , and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even ?
when they have a matter , they come unto me ; and I judge between one and another , and I do make them know the statutes of God , and his laws .
thou wil@@ t surely wear away , both thou , and this people that is with thee : for this thing is too heavy for thee ; thou art not able to perform it thy@@ self alone .
hear@@ ken now unto my voice , I will give thee counsel , and God shall be with thee : be thou for the people to God@@ ward , that thou may@@ est bring the causes unto God :
and let them judge the people at all seasons : and it shall be , that every great matter they shall bring unto thee , but every small matter they shall judge : so shall it be easier for thy@@ self , and they shall bear the burden with thee .
if thou shalt do this thing , and God command thee so , then thou shalt be able to endure , and all this people shall also go to their place in peace .
so Moses hear@@ k@@ ened to the voice of his father in law , and did all that he had said .
and Moses let his father in law depart ; and he went his way into his own land .
in the third month , when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt , the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai .
and Moses went up unto God , and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain , saying , Th@@ us shalt thou say to the house of Jacob , and tell the children of Israel ;
now therefore , if ye will obey my voice indeed , and keep my covenant , then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people : for all the earth is mine :
and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests , and an holy nation . these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel .
and Moses came and called for the elders of the people , and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him .
and all the people answered together , and said , All that the LORD hath spoken we will do . and Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD .
and the LORD said unto Moses , L@@ o , I come unto thee in a thick cloud , that the people may hear when I speak with thee , and believe thee for ever . and Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Go unto the people , and sancti@@ fy them to day and to mor@@ row , and let them wash their clothes ,
and be ready against the third day : for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai .
and thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about , saying , Take heed to yourselves , that ye go not up into the mount , or touch the border of it : wh@@ oso@@ ever touch@@ eth the mount shall be surely put to death :
and it came to pass on the third day in the morning , that there were th@@ un@@ ders and light@@ nings , and a thick cloud upon the mount , and the voice of the trum@@ pet exceeding loud ; so that all the people that was in the camp trem@@ bled .
and the LORD came down upon mount Sinai , on the top of the mount : and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount ; and Moses went up .
and let the priests also , which come near to the LORD , sancti@@ fy themselves , lest the LORD break forth upon them .
I am the LORD thy God , which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bond@@ age .
for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that in them is , and rested the seventh day : W@@ herefore the LORD blessed the sab@@ bath day , and hal@@ lowed it .
thou shalt not co@@ vet thy neighbour 's house , thou shalt not co@@ vet thy neighbour 's wife , nor his man@@ servant , nor his mai@@ d@@ servant , nor his ox , nor his ass , nor any thing that is thy neighbour 's .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Th@@ us thou shalt say unto the children of Israel , Y@@ e have seen that I have talked with you from heaven .
and if the servant shall plainly say , I love my master , my wife , and my children ; I will not go out free :
then his master shall bring him unto the judges ; he shall also bring him to the door , or unto the door post ; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul ; and he shall serve him for ever .
if she please not her master , who hath bet@@ ro@@ thed her to himself , then shall he let her be re@@ deemed : to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power , seeing he hath dealt dece@@ it@@ fully with her .
and if he have bet@@ ro@@ thed her unto his son , he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters .
and he that ste@@ al@@ eth a man , and sel@@ let@@ h him , or if he be found in his hand , he shall surely be put to death .
and if men strive together , and one sm@@ ite another with a stone , or with his fist , and he die not , but keep@@ eth his bed :
if he rise again , and walk abroad upon his staff , then shall he that smo@@ te him be quit : only he shall pay for the loss of his time , and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed .
and if a man sm@@ ite the eye of his servant , or the eye of his maid , that it perish ; he shall let him go free for his eye 's sake .
if there be laid on him a sum of money , then he shall give for the ran@@ som of his life whatsoever is laid upon him .
whether he have go@@ red a son , or have go@@ red a daughter , according to this judgment shall it be done unto him .
if the ox shall push a man@@ servant or a mai@@ d@@ servant ; he shall give unto their master thirty she@@ k@@ els of silver , and the ox shall be st@@ oned .
and if a man shall open a pit , or if a man shall dig a pit , and not cover it , and an ox or an ass fall therein ;
and if one man 's ox hurt another 's , that he die ; then they shall sell the live ox , and divide the money of it ; and the dead ox also they shall divide .
or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past , and his owner hath not kept him in ; he shall surely pay ox for ox ; and the dead shall be his own .
if the sun be risen upon him , there shall be blood shed for him ; for he should make full res@@ titution ; if he have nothing , then he shall be sold for his theft .
if a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep , and it be stolen out of the man 's house ; if the thief be found , let him pay double .
if the thief be not found , then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges , to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour 's goods .
then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both , that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour 's goods ; and the owner of it shall accept thereof , and he shall not make it good .
if it be torn in pieces , then let him bring it for witness , and he shall not make good that which was torn .
and if a man enti@@ ce a maid that is not bet@@ ro@@ thed , and lie with her , he shall surely en@@ dow her to be his wife .
and my wrath shall wax hot , and I will kill you with the sword ; and your wives shall be wid@@ ows , and your children fa@@ ther@@ less .
for that is his covering only , it is his ra@@ iment for his skin : where@@ in shall he sleep ? and it shall come to pass , when he cri@@ eth unto me , that I will hear ; for I am gr@@ acious .
thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits , and of thy liqu@@ ors : the fir@@ st@@ born of thy sons shalt thou give unto me .
likewise shalt thou do with th@@ ine ox@@ en , and with thy sheep : seven days it shall be with his dam ; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me .
and ye shall be holy men unto me : neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field ; ye shall cast it to the dogs .
thou shalt not raise a false report : put not th@@ ine hand with the wicked to be an un@@ righteous witness .
thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil ; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to w@@ rest judgment :
if thou meet th@@ ine enemy 's ox or his ass going astr@@ ay , thou shalt surely bring it back to him again .
if thou see the ass of him that hat@@ eth thee lying under his burden , and w@@ oul@@ dest for@@ bear to help him , thou shalt surely help with him .
and in all things that I have said unto you be circum@@ spect : and make no mention of the name of other gods , neither let it be heard out of thy mouth .
behold , I send an Angel before thee , to keep thee in the way , and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared .
but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice , and do all that I speak ; then I will be an enemy unto th@@ ine enemies , and an adversary unto th@@ ine adversaries .
thou shalt not bow down to their gods , nor serve them , nor do after their works : but thou shalt utterly overthrow them , and quite break down their images .
there shall nothing cast their young , nor be bar@@ ren , in thy land : the number of thy days I will fulfil .
I will send my fear before thee , and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come , and I will make all th@@ ine enemies turn their backs unto thee .
I will not drive them out from before thee in one year ; lest the land become des@@ ol@@ ate , and the beast of the field multiply against thee .
and he said unto Moses , Come up unto the LORD , thou , and Aaron , Nad@@ ab , and A@@ bi@@ hu , and seventy of the elders of Israel ; and worship ye af@@ ar off .
and Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD , and all the judgments : and all the people answered with one voice , and said , All the words which the LORD hath said will we do .
and Moses wrote all the words of the LORD , and rose up early in the morning , and buil@@ ded an altar under the hill , and twelve pillars , according to the twelve tribes of Israel .
and he sent young men of the children of Israel , which offered burnt offerings , and sacrificed peace offerings of ox@@ en unto the LORD .
and he took the book of the covenant , and read in the audience of the people : and they said , All that the LORD hath said will we do , and be obedient .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Come up to me into the mount , and be there : and I will give thee tables of stone , and a law , and commandments which I have written ; that thou may@@ est teach them .
and the glory of the LORD ab@@ ode upon mount Sinai , and the cloud covered it six days : and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud .
and Moses went into the midst of the cloud , and G@@ at him up into the mount : and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights .
speak unto the children of Israel , that they bring me an offering : of every man that gi@@ v@@ eth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering .
and thou shalt over@@ lay it with pure gold , within and without shalt thou over@@ lay it , and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about .
and thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it , and put them in the four corners thereof ; and two rings shall be in the one side of it , and two rings in the other side of it .
the st@@ aves shall be in the rings of the ark : they shall not be taken from it .
and make one cher@@ u@@ b on the one end , and the other cher@@ u@@ b on the other end : even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cher@@ ub@@ ims on the two ends thereof .
and thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark ; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee .
and thou shalt over@@ lay it with pure gold , and make there@@ to a crown of gold round about .
and thou shalt make for it four rings of gold , and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof .
and thou shalt make the st@@ aves of sh@@ it@@ tim wood , and over@@ lay them with gold , that the table may be borne with them .
and thou shalt make the dishes thereof , and spo@@ ons thereof , and covers thereof , and bow@@ ls thereof , to cover with@@ al : of pure gold shalt thou make them .
and thou shalt make a cand@@ les@@ tick of pure gold : of beaten work shall the cand@@ les@@ tick be made : his shaft , and his branches , his bow@@ ls , his kno@@ ps , and his flowers , shall be of the same .
and six branches shall come out of the sides of it ; three branches of the cand@@ les@@ tick out of the one side , and three branches of the cand@@ les@@ tick out of the other side :
and there shall be a kno@@ p under two branches of the same , and a kno@@ p under two branches of the same , and a kno@@ p under two branches of the same , according to the six branches that proceed out of the cand@@ les@@ tick .
and thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof : and they shall light the lamps thereof , that they may give light over against it .
moreover thou shalt make the tab@@ ern@@ acle with ten curtains of fine tw@@ ined linen , and blue , and purple , and scar@@ let : with cher@@ ub@@ ims of cunning work shalt thou make them .
and thou shalt make fifty t@@ aches of gold , and couple the curtains together with the t@@ aches : and it shall be one tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and thou shalt make curtains of goats ' hair to be a covering upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle : eleven curtains shalt thou make .
the length of one curtain shall be thirty cub@@ its , and the breadth of one curtain four cub@@ its : and the eleven curtains shall be all of one measure .
and thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves , and six curtains by themselves , and shalt double the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain that is out@@ most in the cou@@ pling , and fifty loops in the edge of the curtain which cou@@ pl@@ eth the second .
and thou shalt make fifty t@@ aches of brass , and put the t@@ aches into the loops , and couple the tent together , that it may be one .
and the remn@@ ant that remain@@ eth of the curtains of the tent , the half curtain that remain@@ eth , shall hang over the back@@ side of the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and a cub@@ it on the one side , and a cub@@ it on the other side of that which remain@@ eth in the length of the curtains of the tent , it shall hang over the sides of the tab@@ ern@@ acle on this side and on that side , to cover it .
and thou shalt make a covering for the tent of r@@ ams ' skins dy@@ ed red , and a covering above of Bad@@ gers ' skins .

and this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hal@@ low them , to minister unto me in the priest 's office : take one young bul@@ lock , and two r@@ ams without bl@@ emish ,

see , I have called by name B@@ ez@@ al@@ e@@ el the son of U@@ ri , the son of H@@ ur , of the tribe of Jud@@ ah :
and I , behold , I have given with him A@@ hol@@ i@@ ab , the son of Ah@@ is@@ am@@ ach , of the tribe of Dan : and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom , that they may make all that I have commanded thee ;
speak thou also unto the children of Israel , saying , Ver@@ ily my sab@@ baths ye shall keep : for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations ; that ye may know that I am the LORD that do@@ th sancti@@ fy you .
six days may work be done ; but in the seventh is the sab@@ bath of rest , holy to the LORD : wh@@ oso@@ ever do@@ eth any work in the sab@@ bath day , he shall surely be put to death .
W@@ herefore the children of Israel shall keep the sab@@ bath , to observe the sab@@ bath throughout their generations , for a perpetual covenant .
it is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever : for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth , and on the seventh day he rested , and was refresh@@ ed .
and he gave unto Moses , when he had made an end of commun@@ ing with him upon mount Sinai , two tables of testimony , tables of stone , written with the finger of God .
and Aaron said unto them , Bre@@ ak off the golden ear@@ rings , which are in the ears of your wives , of your sons , and of your daughters , and bring them unto me .
and all the people brake off the golden ear@@ rings which were in their ears , and brought them unto Aaron .
and he received them at their hand , and fashioned it with a gra@@ ving tool , after he had made it a mol@@ ten cal@@ f : and they said , These be thy gods , O Israel , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
and they rose up early on the mor@@ row , and offered burnt offerings , and brought peace offerings ; and the people sat down to eat and to drink , and rose up to play .
they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them : they have made them a mol@@ ten cal@@ f , and have wor@@ shipped it , and have sacrificed there@@ unto , and said , These be thy gods , O Israel , which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
and the LORD said unto Moses , I have seen this people , and , behold , it is a sti@@ ff@@ nec@@ ked people :
now therefore let me alone , that my wrath may wax hot against them , and that I may consume them : and I will make of thee a great nation .
and Moses bes@@ ought the LORD his God , and said , LORD , why do@@ th thy wrath wax hot against thy people , which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power , and with a mighty hand ?
and Moses turned , and went down from the mount , and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand : the tables were written on both their sides ; on the one side and on the other were they written .
and the tables were the work of God , and the writing was the writing of God , gra@@ ven upon the tables .
and he took the cal@@ f which they had made , and burnt it in the fire , and ground it to powder , and str@@ aw@@ ed it upon the water , and made the children of Israel drink of it .
and Aaron said , Let not the anger of my lord wax hot : thou know@@ est the people , that they are set on mis@@ chief .
for they said unto me , Make us gods , which shall go before us : for as for this Moses , the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we w@@ ot not what is become of him .
and I said unto them , Wh@@ oso@@ ever hath any gold , let them break it off . so they gave it me : then I cast it into the fire , and there came out this cal@@ f .
and the children of Lev@@ i did according to the word of Moses : and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men .
for Moses had said , consec@@ rate yourselves to day to the LORD , even every man upon his son , and upon his brother ; that he may best@@ ow upon you a blessing this day .
and Moses returned unto the LORD , and said , Oh , this people have sin@@ ned a great sin , and have made them gods of gold .
yet now , if thou wil@@ t forgive their sin@@ -- ; and if not , b@@ lot me , I pray thee , out of thy book which thou hast written .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Wh@@ oso@@ ever hath sin@@ ned against me , him will I b@@ lot out of my book .
therefore now go , lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee : behold , mine Angel shall go before thee : nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them .
and the LORD said unto Moses , De@@ part , and go up hence , thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt , unto the land which I sw@@ are unto Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , saying , Un@@ to thy seed will I give it :
and it came to pass , when Moses went out unto the tab@@ ern@@ acle , that all the people rose up , and stood every man at his tent door , and looked after Moses , until he was gone into the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and it came to pass , as Moses entered into the tab@@ ern@@ acle , the cloudy pillar descended , and stood at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and the LORD talked with Moses .
and the LORD sp@@ ake unto Moses face to face , as a man spe@@ ak@@ eth unto his friend . and he turned again into the camp : but his servant Joshua , the son of N@@ un , a young man , departed not out of the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and I will take away mine hand , and thou shalt see my back parts : but my face shall not be seen .
and the LORD said unto Moses , H@@ ew thee two tables of stone like unto the first : and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables , which thou br@@ ak@@ est .
and be ready in the morning , and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai , and present thy@@ self there to me in the top of the mount .
and he he@@ wed two tables of stone like unto the first ; and Moses rose up early in the morning , and went up unto mount Sinai , as the LORD had commanded him , and took in his hand the two tables of stone .
and the LORD passed by before him , and proclaimed , The LORD , The LORD God , mer@@ ciful and gr@@ acious , long@@ suffering , and abundant in goodness and truth ,
keeping mercy for thousands , for@@ giving ini@@ qu@@ ity and trans@@ g@@ ression and sin , and that will by no means clear the guilty ; visiting the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the fathers upon the children , and upon the children 's children , unto the third and to the fourth generation .
and he said , If now I have found grace in thy sight , O Lord , let my Lord , I pray thee , go among us ; for it is a sti@@ ff@@ nec@@ ked people ; and pardon our ini@@ qu@@ ity and our sin , and take us for th@@ ine inheritance .
observe thou that which I command thee this day : behold , I drive out before thee the A@@ mor@@ ite , and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , and the Hit@@ tite , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , and the Hi@@ v@@ ite , and the Je@@ bus@@ ite .
take heed to thy@@ self , lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whi@@ ther thou go@@ est , lest it be for a sn@@ are in the midst of thee :
the feast of un@@ leav@@ ened bread shalt thou keep . seven days thou shalt eat un@@ leav@@ ened bread , as I commanded thee , in the time of the month A@@ bi@@ b : for in the month A@@ bi@@ b thou cam@@ est out from Egypt .
but the fir@@ st@@ ling of an ass thou shalt re@@ deem with a lamb : and if thou re@@ deem him not , then shalt thou break his neck . all the fir@@ st@@ born of thy sons thou shalt re@@ deem . and none shall appear before me empty .
six days thou shalt work , but on the seventh day thou shalt rest : in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest .
for I will cast out the nations before thee , and enlarge thy borders : neither shall any man desire thy land , when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thr@@ ice in the year .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Write thou these words : for after the ten@@ or of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel .
and he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights ; he did neither eat bread , nor drink water . and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant , the ten commandments .
and when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses , behold , the skin of his face shone ; and they were afraid to come ni@@ gh him .
and afterward all the children of Israel came ni@@ gh : and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai .
but when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him , he took the V@@ ail off , until he came out . and he came out , and sp@@ ake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded .
six days shall work be done , but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day , a sab@@ bath of rest to the LORD : wh@@ oso@@ ever do@@ eth work therein shall be put to death .
the cand@@ les@@ tick also for the light , and his furniture , and his lamps , with the oil for the light ,
the hang@@ ings of the court , his pillars , and their sockets , and the hanging for the door of the court ,
and they came , every one whose heart stirred him up , and every one whom his spirit made willing , and they brought the LORD 's offering to the work of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , and for all his service , and for the holy garments .
and they came , both men and women , as many as were willing hearted , and brought brac@@ elets , and ear@@ rings , and rings , and tablets , all jew@@ els of gold : and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the LORD .
and every man , with whom was found blue , and purple , and scar@@ let , and fine linen , and goats ' hair , and red skins of r@@ ams , and Bad@@ gers ' skins , brought them .
and Moses said unto the children of Israel , See , the LORD hath called by name B@@ ez@@ al@@ e@@ el the son of U@@ ri , the son of H@@ ur , of the tribe of Jud@@ ah ;
then wrought B@@ ez@@ al@@ e@@ el and A@@ hol@@ i@@ ab , and every wise hearted man , in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary , according to all that the LORD had commanded .
and Moses called B@@ ez@@ al@@ e@@ el and A@@ hol@@ i@@ ab , and every wise hearted man , in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom , even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it :
and they received of Moses all the offering , which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary , to make it with@@ al . and they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning .
and they sp@@ ake unto Moses , saying , The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work , which the LORD commanded to make .
and Moses gave commandment , and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp , saying , Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary . so the people were restrained from bringing .
and every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tab@@ ern@@ acle made ten curtains of fine tw@@ ined linen , and blue , and purple , and scar@@ let : with cher@@ ub@@ ims of cunning work made he them .
fifty loops made he in one curtain , and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain which was in the cou@@ pling of the second : the loops held one curtain to another .
and he made curtains of goats ' hair for the tent over the tab@@ ern@@ acle : eleven curtains he made them .
and he made fifty t@@ aches of brass to couple the tent together , that it might be one .
one board had two ten@@ ons , equally distant one from another : thus did he make for all the boards of the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and they were coupled beneath , and coupled together at the head thereof , to one ring : thus he did to both of them in both the corners .
and there were eight boards ; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver , under every board two sockets .
and he made bars of sh@@ it@@ tim wood ; five for the boards of the one side of the tab@@ ern@@ acle ,
and he over@@ laid the boards with gold , and made their rings of gold to be places for the bars , and over@@ laid the bars with gold .
and he made there@@ unto four pillars of sh@@ it@@ tim wood , and over@@ laid them with gold : their hoo@@ ks were of gold ; and he cast for them four sockets of silver .
and the five pillars of it with their hoo@@ ks : and he over@@ laid their chap@@ it@@ ers and their fil@@ lets with gold : but their five sockets were of brass .
and he over@@ laid it with pure gold within and without , and made a crown of gold to it round about .
and he cast for it four rings of gold , to be set by the four corners of it ; even two rings upon the one side of it , and two rings upon the other side of it .
and he put the st@@ aves into the rings by the sides of the ark , to bear the ark .
and the cher@@ ub@@ ims spread out their wings on high , and covered with their wings over the mercy seat , with their faces one to another ; even to the mercy se@@ at@@ ward were the faces of the cher@@ ub@@ ims .
and he cast for it four rings of gold , and put the rings upon the four corners that were in the four feet thereof .
over against the border were the rings , the places for the st@@ aves to bear the table .
and he made the st@@ aves of sh@@ it@@ tim wood , and over@@ laid them with gold , to bear the table .
and he made the vessels which were upon the table , his dishes , and his spo@@ ons , and his bow@@ ls , and his covers to cover with@@ al , of pure gold .
and he made the cand@@ les@@ tick of pure gold : of beaten work made he the cand@@ les@@ tick ; his shaft , and his branch , his bow@@ ls , his kno@@ ps , and his flowers , were of the same :
three bow@@ ls made after the fashion of al@@ mon@@ ds in one branch , a kno@@ p and a flower ; and three bow@@ ls made like al@@ mon@@ ds in another branch , a kno@@ p and a flower : so throughout the six branches going out of the cand@@ les@@ tick .
and a kno@@ p under two branches of the same , and a kno@@ p under two branches of the same , and a kno@@ p under two branches of the same , according to the six branches going out of it .
and he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof , by the two corners of it , upon the two sides thereof , to be places for the st@@ aves to bear it with@@ al .
and he made the holy ano@@ in@@ ting oil , and the pure inc@@ ense of sweet spices , according to the work of the ap@@ oth@@ ec@@ ary .
and he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it ; the horns thereof were of the same : and he over@@ laid it with brass .
and he put the st@@ aves into the rings on the sides of the altar , to bear it with@@ al ; he made the altar hollow with boards .
and the sockets for the pillars were of brass ; the hoo@@ ks of the pillars and their fil@@ lets of silver ; and the over@@ laying of their chap@@ it@@ ers of silver ; and all the pillars of the court were f@@ ill@@ eted with silver .
and the hanging for the gate of the court was need@@ le@@ work , of blue , and purple , and scar@@ let , and fine tw@@ ined linen : and twenty cub@@ its was the length , and the height in the breadth was five cub@@ its , answ@@ er@@ able to the hang@@ ings of the court .
and of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary , and the sockets of the V@@ ail ; an hundred sockets of the hundred talents , a talent for a socket .
and there@@ with he made the sockets to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , and the br@@ as@@ en altar , and the br@@ as@@ en gr@@ ate for it , and all the vessels of the altar ,
and of the blue , and purple , and scar@@ let , they made clo@@ ths of service , to do service in the holy place , and made the holy garments for Aaron ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
and the curious gir@@ dle of his ep@@ ho@@ d , that was upon it , was of the same , according to the work thereof ; of gold , blue , and purple , and scar@@ let , and fine tw@@ ined linen ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
it was four@@ square ; they made the breast@@ plate double : a span was the length thereof , and a span the breadth thereof , being doubled .
and they set in it four rows of stones : the first row was a s@@ ardi@@ us , a top@@ az , and a car@@ bun@@ cle : this was the first row .
and they made two ou@@ ches of gold , and two gold rings ; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breast@@ plate .
and they put the two wre@@ a@@ then chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breast@@ plate .
and the two ends of the two wre@@ a@@ then chains they fast@@ ened in the two ou@@ ches , and put them on the shoul@@ der@@ pieces of the ep@@ ho@@ d , before it .
and they did bind the breast@@ plate by his rings unto the rings of the ep@@ ho@@ d with a lace of blue , that it might be above the curious gir@@ dle of the ep@@ ho@@ d , and that the breast@@ plate might not be loos@@ ed from the ep@@ ho@@ d ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
a bell and a p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate , a bell and a p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate , round about the hem of the robe to minister in ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
and they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold , and wrote upon it a writing , like to the eng@@ rav@@ ings of a sig@@ net , HO@@ LIN@@ E@@ SS TO THE LORD .
and they brought the tab@@ ern@@ acle unto Moses , the tent , and all his furniture , his t@@ aches , his boards , his bars , and his pillars , and his sockets ,
the pure cand@@ les@@ tick , with the lamps thereof , even with the lamps to be set in order , and all the vessels thereof , and the oil for light ,
according to all that the LORD commanded Moses , so the children of Israel made all the work .
and Moses did look upon all the work , and , behold , they have done it as the LORD had commanded , even so had they done it : and Moses blessed them .
and thou shalt set the lav@@ er between the tent of the congregation and the altar , and shalt put water therein .
and thou shalt take the ano@@ in@@ ting oil , and ano@@ int the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and all that is therein , and shalt hal@@ low it , and all the vessels thereof : and it shall be holy .
and thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , and wash them with water .
and thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments , and ano@@ int him , and sancti@@ fy him ; that he may minister unto me in the priest 's office .
and thou shalt ano@@ int them , as thou did@@ st ano@@ int their father , that they may minister unto me in the priest 's office : for their ano@@ in@@ ting shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations .
and he took and put the testimony into the ark , and set the st@@ aves on the ark , and put the mercy seat above upon the ark :
and he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD ; as the LORD had commanded Moses .
and he set the lav@@ er between the tent of the congregation and the altar , and put water there , to wash with@@ al .
when they went into the tent of the congregation , and when they came near unto the altar , they washed ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
and he re@@ ared up the court round about the tab@@ ern@@ acle and the altar , and set up the hanging of the court gate . so Moses finished the work .
and Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation , because the cloud ab@@ ode there@@ on , and the glory of the LORD filled the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and when the cloud was taken up from over the tab@@ ern@@ acle , the children of Israel went on@@ ward in all their journeys :
and the LORD called unto Moses , and sp@@ ake unto him out of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , saying ,
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD , ye shall bring your offering of the cattle , even of the herd , and of the flock .
if his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd , let him offer a male without bl@@ emish : he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation before the LORD .
and he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering ; and it shall be accepted for him to make at@@ onement for him .
and if his offering be of the f@@ locks , namely , of the sheep , or of the goats , for a burnt sacrifice ; he shall bring it a male without bl@@ emish .
and he shall kill it on the side of the altar nor@@ th@@ ward before the LORD : and the priests , Aaron 's sons , shall sprink@@ le his blood round about upon the altar .
and he shall cut it into his pieces , with his head and his fat : and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is upon the altar :
and if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of f@@ ow@@ ls , then he shall bring his offering of tur@@ t@@ le@@ d@@ oves , or of young pig@@ eons .
and when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD , his offering shall be of fine flour ; and he shall pour oil upon it , and put frank@@ inc@@ ense there@@ on :
and if thou bring an ob@@ lation of a meat offering b@@ aken in the oven , it shall be un@@ leav@@ ened cakes of fine flour ming@@ led with oil , or un@@ leav@@ ened w@@ af@@ ers ano@@ inted with oil .
and if thy ob@@ lation be a meat offering b@@ aken in the fr@@ y@@ ing@@ pan , it shall be made of fine flour with oil .
no meat offering , which ye shall bring unto the LORD , shall be made with leav@@ en : for ye shall burn no leav@@ en , nor any honey , in any offering of the LORD made by fire .
and if his ob@@ lation be a sacrifice of peace offering , if he offer it of the herd ; whether it be a male or female , he shall offer it without bl@@ emish before the LORD .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation : and Aaron 's sons the priests shall sprink@@ le the blood upon the altar round about .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is on them , which is by the fl@@ an@@ ks , and the c@@ aul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation : and Aaron 's sons shall sprink@@ le the blood thereof round about upon the altar .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the fl@@ an@@ ks , and the c@@ aul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it , and kill it before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation : and the sons of Aaron shall sprink@@ le the blood thereof upon the altar round about .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the fl@@ an@@ ks , and the c@@ aul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away .
if the priest that is ano@@ inted do sin according to the sin of the people ; then let him bring for his sin , which he hath sin@@ ned , a young bul@@ lock without bl@@ emish unto the LORD for a sin offering .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the fl@@ an@@ ks , and the c@@ aul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away ,
and the skin of the bul@@ lock , and all his flesh , with his head , and with his legs , and his in@@ wards , and his d@@ ung ,
even the whole bul@@ lock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place , where the ashes are poured out , and burn him on the wood with fire : where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt .
and if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance , and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly , and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done , and are guilty ;
and he shall do with the bul@@ lock as he did with the bul@@ lock for a sin offering , so shall he do with this : and the priest shall make an at@@ onement for them , and it shall be forgiven them .
and he shall carry forth the bul@@ lock without the camp , and burn him as he burned the first bul@@ lock : it is a sin offering for the congregation .
and he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat , and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD : it is a sin offering .
and he shall burn all his fat upon the altar , as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings : and the priest shall make an at@@ onement for him as concerning his sin , and it shall be forgiven him .
and if any one of the common people sin through ignorance , while he do@@ eth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done , and be guilty ;
or if his sin , which he hath sin@@ ned , come to his knowledge : then he shall bring his offering , a kid of the goats , a female without bl@@ emish , for his sin which he hath sin@@ ned .
and if a soul sin , and hear the voice of sw@@ earing , and is a witness , whether he hath seen or known of it ; if he do not utter it , then he shall bear his ini@@ qu@@ ity .
or if a soul touch any un@@ clean thing , whether it be a car@@ case of an un@@ clean beast , or a car@@ case of un@@ clean cattle , or the car@@ case of un@@ clean cre@@ eping things , and if it be hidden from him ; he also shall be un@@ clean , and guilty .
or if he touch the un@@ clean@@ ness of man , whatsoever un@@ clean@@ ness it be that a man shall be de@@ filed with@@ al , and it be hid from him ; when he know@@ eth of it , then he shall be guilty .
and if he be not able to bring a lamb , then he shall bring for his t@@ resp@@ ass , which he hath committed , two tur@@ t@@ le@@ d@@ oves , or two young pig@@ eons , unto the LORD ; one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering .
and he shall bring them unto the priest , who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first , and wr@@ ing off his head from his neck , but shall not divide it as@@ under :
and the priest shall make an at@@ onement for him as touching his sin that he hath sin@@ ned in one of these , and it shall be forgiven him : and the remn@@ ant shall be the priest 's , as a meat offering .
and if a soul sin , and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD ; though he w@@ ist it not , yet is he guilty , and shall bear his ini@@ qu@@ ity .
if a soul sin , and commit a t@@ resp@@ ass against the LORD , and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep , or in fellowship , or in a thing taken away by violence , or hath deceived his neighbour ;
or have found that which was lost , and li@@ eth concerning it , and swe@@ areth fal@@ sely ; in any of all these that a man do@@ eth , s@@ inning therein :
then it shall be , because he hath sin@@ ned , and is guilty , that he shall restore that which he took violently away , or the thing which he hath dece@@ it@@ fully gotten , or that which was delivered him to keep , or the lost thing which he found ,
or all that about which he hath sworn fal@@ sely ; he shall even restore it in the principal , and shall add the fifth part more there@@ to , and give it unto him to whom it ap@@ per@@ tain@@ eth , in the day of his t@@ resp@@ ass offering .
and he shall bring his t@@ resp@@ ass offering unto the LORD , a ram without bl@@ emish out of the flock , with thy estimation , for a t@@ resp@@ ass offering , unto the priest :
and the priest shall make an at@@ onement for him before the LORD : and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in t@@ resp@@ assing therein .
and the priest shall put on his linen garment , and his linen bre@@ ech@@ es shall he put upon his flesh , and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar , and he shall put them beside the altar .
and the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat : with un@@ leav@@ ened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place ; in the court of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation they shall eat it .
it shall not be b@@ aken with leav@@ en . I have given it unto them for their portion of my offerings made by fire ; it is most holy , as is the sin offering , and as the t@@ resp@@ ass offering .
in a pan it shall be made with oil ; and when it is b@@ aken , thou shalt bring it in : and the b@@ aken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a sweet sav@@ our unto the LORD .
and the priest of his sons that is ano@@ inted in his stead shall offer it : it is a statute for ever unto the LORD , it shall be wholly burnt .
speak unto Aaron and to his sons , saying , This is the law of the sin offering : in the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD : it is most holy .
the priest that off@@ er@@ eth it for sin shall eat it : in the holy place shall it be eaten , in the court of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation .
whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy : and when there is sprink@@ led of the blood thereof upon any garment , thou shalt wash that where@@ on it was sprink@@ led in the holy place .
but the ear@@ then vessel where@@ in it is so@@ dden shall be broken : and if it be so@@ dden in a br@@ as@@ en pot , it shall be both sc@@ oured , and rin@@ sed in water .
and no sin offering , where@@ of any of the blood is brought into the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation to reconcile with@@ al in the holy place , shall be eaten : it shall be burnt in the fire .
in the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the t@@ resp@@ ass offering : and the blood thereof shall he sprink@@ le round about upon the altar .
and the two kidneys , and the fat that is on them , which is by the fl@@ an@@ ks , and the c@@ aul that is above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away :
and the priest that off@@ er@@ eth any man 's burnt offering , even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered .
and all the meat offering that is b@@ aken in the oven , and all that is dressed in the fr@@ y@@ ing@@ pan , and in the pan , shall be the priest 's that off@@ er@@ eth it .
besides the cakes , he shall offer for his offering leav@@ ened bread with the sacrifice of thank@@ s@@ giving of his peace offerings .
and of it he shall offer one out of the whole ob@@ lation for an he@@ ave offering unto the LORD , and it shall be the priest 's that sprink@@ let@@ h the blood of the peace offerings .
but if the sacrifice of his offering be a vo@@ w , or a voluntary offering , it shall be eaten the same day that he off@@ er@@ eth his sacrifice : and on the mor@@ row also the remainder of it shall be eaten :
speak unto the children of Israel , saying , Y@@ e shall eat no manner of fat , of ox , or of sheep , or of goat .
moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood , whether it be of f@@ owl or of beast , in any of your dwell@@ ings .
whatsoever soul it be that e@@ at@@ eth any manner of blood , even that soul shall be cut off from his people .
which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel , in the day that he ano@@ inted them , by a statute for ever throughout their generations .
which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai , in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their ob@@ l@@ ations unto the LORD , in the wilderness of Sinai .
take Aaron and his sons with him , and the garments , and the ano@@ in@@ ting oil , and a bul@@ lock for the sin offering , and two r@@ ams , and a basket of un@@ leav@@ ened bread ;
and Moses did as the LORD commanded him ; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation .
and he put the mit@@ re upon his head ; also upon the mit@@ re , even upon his forefront , did he put the golden plate , the holy crown ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
and he sprink@@ led thereof upon the altar seven times , and ano@@ inted the altar and all his vessels , both the lav@@ er and his foot , to sancti@@ fy them .
and he brought the bul@@ lock for the sin offering : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bul@@ lock for the sin offering .
and he sle@@ w it ; and Moses took the blood , and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger , and purified the altar , and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar , and sancti@@ fied it , to make reconciliation upon it .
and he took all the fat that was upon the in@@ wards , and c@@ aul above the liver , and the two kidneys , and their fat , and Moses burned it upon the altar .
and he brought the ram for the burnt offering : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram .
and he cut the ram into pieces ; and Moses burnt the head , and the pieces , and the fat .
and he brought the other ram , the ram of consec@@ ration : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram .
and he sle@@ w it ; and Moses took of the blood of it , and put it upon the tip of Aaron 's right ear , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the great toe of his right foot .
and he brought Aaron 's sons , and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear , and upon the thum@@ bs of their right hands , and upon the great toes of their right feet : and Moses sprink@@ led the blood upon the altar round about .
and he took the fat , and the r@@ ump , and all the fat that was upon the in@@ wards , and the c@@ aul above the liver , and the two kidneys , and their fat , and the right shoulder :
and Moses took the breast , and wav@@ ed it for a wave offering before the LORD : for of the ram of consec@@ ration it was Moses ' part ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
and Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons , B@@ oil the flesh at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation : and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consec@@ r@@ ations , as I commanded , saying , Aaron and his sons shall eat it .
therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation day and night seven days , and keep the charge of the LORD , that ye die not : for so I am commanded .
and he said unto Aaron , Take thee a young cal@@ f for a sin offering , and a ram for a burnt offering , without bl@@ emish , and offer them before the LORD .
also a bul@@ lock and a ram for peace offerings , to sacrifice before the LORD ; and a meat offering ming@@ led with oil : for to day the LORD will appear unto you .
and Moses said unto Aaron , Go unto the altar , and offer thy sin offering , and thy burnt offering , and make an at@@ onement for thy@@ self , and for the people : and offer the offering of the people , and make an at@@ onement for them ; as the LORD commanded .
but the fat , and the kidneys , and the c@@ aul above the liver of the sin offering , he burnt upon the altar ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
and he sle@@ w the burnt offering ; and Aaron 's sons presented unto him the blood , which he sprink@@ led round about upon the altar .
he sle@@ w also the bul@@ lock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings , which was for the people : and Aaron 's sons presented unto him the blood , which he sprink@@ led upon the altar round about ,
and Moses and Aaron went into the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , and came out , and blessed the people : and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people .
and there came a fire out from before the LORD , and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat : which when all the people saw , they shouted , and fell on their faces .
and Moses called Mis@@ hael and El@@ z@@ aph@@ an , the sons of Uz@@ zi@@ el the uncle of Aaron , and said unto them , Come near , carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp .
do not drink wine nor strong drink , thou , nor thy sons with thee , when ye go into the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , lest ye die : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations :
and Moses sp@@ ake unto Aaron , and unto Ele@@ az@@ ar and unto I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , his sons that were left , Take the meat offering that remain@@ eth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire , and eat it without leav@@ en beside the altar : for it is most holy :
and Moses dilig@@ ently sought the goat of the sin offering , and , behold , it was burnt : and he was angry with Ele@@ az@@ ar and I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , the sons of Aaron which were left alive , saying ,
W@@ herefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place , seeing it is most holy , and God hath given it you to bear the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the congregation , to make at@@ onement for them before the LORD ?
behold , the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place : ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place , as I commanded .
nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cu@@ d , or of them that divide the ho@@ of : as the cam@@ el , because he chew@@ eth the cu@@ d , but divi@@ det@@ h not the ho@@ of ; he is un@@ clean unto you .
of their flesh shall ye not eat , and their car@@ case shall ye not touch ; they are un@@ clean to you .
and all that have not fin@@ s and scales in the seas , and in the rivers , of all that move in the waters , and of any living thing which is in the waters , they shall be an ab@@ om@@ ination unto you :
even these of them ye may eat ; the loc@@ ust after his kind , and the bal@@ d loc@@ ust after his kind , and the beet@@ le after his kind , and the gras@@ shop@@ per after his kind .
and whatsoever go@@ eth upon his pa@@ ws , among all manner of beasts that go on all four , those are un@@ clean unto you : wh@@ os@@ o touch@@ eth their car@@ case shall be un@@ clean until the even .
these also shall be un@@ clean unto you among the cre@@ eping things that cre@@ ep upon the earth ; the we@@ as@@ el , and the mouse , and the tor@@ to@@ ise after his kind ,
these are un@@ clean to you among all that cre@@ ep : wh@@ oso@@ ever do@@ th touch them , when they be dead , shall be un@@ clean until the even .
and every thing where@@ upon any part of their car@@ case fall@@ eth shall be un@@ clean ; whether it be oven , or ranges for pots , they shall be broken down : for they are un@@ clean , and shall be un@@ clean unto you .
nevertheless a fountain or pit , where@@ in there is plenty of water , shall be clean : but that which touch@@ eth their car@@ case shall be un@@ clean .
and he that e@@ at@@ eth of the car@@ case of it shall wash his clothes , and be un@@ clean until the even : he also that be@@ areth the car@@ case of it shall wash his clothes , and be un@@ clean until the even .
ye shall not make yourselves ab@@ om@@ in@@ able with any cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth , neither shall ye make yourselves un@@ clean with them , that ye should be de@@ filed thereby .
for I am the LORD your God : ye shall therefore sancti@@ fy yourselves , and ye shall be holy ; for I am holy : neither shall ye def@@ ile yourselves with any manner of cre@@ eping thing that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the earth .
for I am the LORD that br@@ ing@@ eth you up out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : ye shall therefore be holy , for I am holy .
this is the law of the beasts , and of the f@@ owl , and of every living creature that mo@@ v@@ eth in the waters , and of every creature that cre@@ ep@@ eth upon the earth :
to make a difference between the un@@ clean and the clean , and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten .
speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a woman have conceived seed , and born a man child : then she shall be un@@ clean seven days ; according to the days of the separation for her in@@ firm@@ ity shall she be un@@ clean .
who shall offer it before the LORD , and make an at@@ onement for her ; and she shall be cleans@@ ed from the issue of her blood . this is the law for her that hath born a male or a female .
and if she be not able to bring a lamb , then she shall bring two tur@@ tles , or two young pig@@ eons ; the one for the burnt offering , and the other for a sin offering : and the priest shall make an at@@ onement for her , and she shall be clean .
if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh , and in sight be not deeper than the skin , and the hair thereof be not turned white ; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days :
but if the sc@@ ab spread much abroad in the skin , after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing , he shall be seen of the priest again :
it is an old le@@ pro@@ sy in the skin of his flesh , and the priest shall pron@@ ounce him un@@ clean , and shall not shut him up : for he is un@@ clean .
then the priest shall consider : and , behold , if the le@@ pro@@ sy have covered all his flesh , he shall pron@@ ounce him clean that hath the plague : it is all turned white : he is clean .
and if , when the priest se@@ eth it , behold , it be in sight lower than the skin , and the hair thereof be turned white ; the priest shall pron@@ ounce him un@@ clean : it is a plague of le@@ pro@@ sy broken out of the boil .
but if the priest look on it , and , behold , there be no white ha@@ irs therein , and if it be not lower than the skin , but be somewhat dark ; then the priest shall shut him up seven days :
and if it spread much abroad in the skin , then the priest shall pron@@ ounce him un@@ clean : it is a plague .
but if the bright spot stay in his place , and spread not , it is a burning boil ; and the priest shall pron@@ ounce him clean .
and the priest shall look upon him the seventh day : and if it be spread much abroad in the skin , then the priest shall pron@@ ounce him un@@ clean : it is the plague of le@@ pro@@ sy .
and if the bright spot stay in his place , and spread not in the skin , but it be somewhat dark ; it is a rising of the burning , and the priest shall pron@@ ounce him clean : for it is an inflammation of the burning .
he shall be sha@@ ven , but the sc@@ all shall he not s@@ have ; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the sc@@ all seven days more :
and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the sc@@ all : and , behold , if the sc@@ all be not spread in the skin , nor be in sight deeper than the skin ; then the priest shall pron@@ ounce him clean : and he shall wash his clothes , and be clean .
but if the sc@@ all be in his sight at a stay , and that there is black hair grown up therein ; the sc@@ all is healed , he is clean : and the priest shall pron@@ ounce him clean .
if a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots , even white bright spots ;
the garment also that the plague of le@@ pro@@ sy is in , whether it be a w@@ ool@@ len garment , or a linen garment ;
whether it be in the war@@ p , or wo@@ of ; of linen , or of w@@ ool@@ len ; whether in a skin , or in any thing made of skin ;
and if the plague be green@@ ish or red@@ dish in the garment , or in the skin , either in the war@@ p , or in the wo@@ of , or in any thing of skin ; it is a plague of le@@ pro@@ sy , and shall be sh@@ ew@@ ed unto the priest :
he shall therefore burn that garment , whether war@@ p or wo@@ of , in w@@ ool@@ len or in linen , or any thing of skin , where@@ in the plague is : for it is a f@@ ret@@ ting le@@ pro@@ sy ; it shall be burnt in the fire .
and if the priest shall look , and , behold , the plague be not spread in the garment , either in the war@@ p , or in the wo@@ of , or in any thing of skin ;
then the priest shall command that they wash the thing where@@ in the plague is , and he shall shut it up seven days more :
and if the priest look , and , behold , the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of it ; then he shall ren@@ d it out of the garment , or out of the skin , or out of the war@@ p , or out of the wo@@ of :
and the garment , either war@@ p , or wo@@ of , or whatsoever thing of skin it be , which thou shalt wash , if the plague be departed from them , then it shall be washed the second time , and shall be clean .
this is the law of the plague of le@@ pro@@ sy in a garment of w@@ ool@@ len or linen , either in the war@@ p , or wo@@ of , or any thing of skins , to pron@@ ounce it clean , or to pron@@ ounce it un@@ clean .
and the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an ear@@ then vessel over running water :
but it shall be on the seventh day , that he shall s@@ have all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows , even all his hair he shall s@@ have off : and he shall wash his clothes , also he shall wash his flesh in water , and he shall be clean .
and on the eighth day he shall take two he lam@@ bs without bl@@ emish , and one e@@ we lamb of the first year without bl@@ emish , and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering , ming@@ led with oil , and one log of oil .
and the priest shall take one he lamb , and offer him for a t@@ resp@@ ass offering , and the log of oil , and wave them for a wave offering before the LORD :
and he shall sl@@ ay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering , in the holy place : for as the sin offering is the priest 's , so is the t@@ resp@@ ass offering : it is most holy :
and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand , and shall sprink@@ le of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD :
and of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleans@@ ed , and upon the thumb of his right hand , and upon the great toe of his right foot , upon the blood of the t@@ resp@@ ass offering :
and two tur@@ t@@ le@@ d@@ oves , or two young pig@@ eons , such as he is able to get ; and the one shall be a sin offering , and the other a burnt offering .
and he shall offer the one of the tur@@ t@@ le@@ d@@ oves , or of the young pig@@ eons , such as he can get ;
when ye be come into the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which I give to you for a possession , and I put the plague of le@@ pro@@ sy in a house of the land of your possession ;
and he that ow@@ neth the house shall come and tell the priest , saying , It seem@@ eth to me there is as it were a plague in the house :
and they shall take other stones , and put them in the place of those stones ; and he shall take other mor@@ ter , and shall pl@@ ai@@ ster the house .
and he shall take the c@@ edar wood , and the h@@ ys@@ so@@ p , and the scar@@ let , and the living bird , and dip them in the blood of the sl@@ ain bird , and in the running water , and sprink@@ le the house seven times :
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When any man hath a running issue out of his flesh , because of his issue he is un@@ clean .
and he that touch@@ eth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his clothes , and ba@@ the himself in water , and be un@@ clean until the even .
and wh@@ om@@ soever he touch@@ eth that hath the issue , and hath not rin@@ sed his hands in water , he shall wash his clothes , and ba@@ the himself in water , and be un@@ clean until the even .
and the vessel of earth , that he touch@@ eth which hath the issue , shall be broken : and every vessel of wood shall be rin@@ sed in water .
and when he that hath an issue is cleans@@ ed of his issue ; then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing , and wash his clothes , and ba@@ the his flesh in running water , and shall be clean .
and on the eighth day he shall take to him two tur@@ t@@ le@@ d@@ oves , or two young pig@@ eons , and come before the LORD unto the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , and give them unto the priest :
and the priest shall offer them , the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering ; and the priest shall make an at@@ onement for him before the LORD for his issue .
and if any man 's seed of cop@@ ulation go out from him , then he shall wash all his flesh in water , and be un@@ clean until the even .
but if she be cleans@@ ed of her issue , then she shall number to herself seven days , and after that she shall be clean .
and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering ; and the priest shall make an at@@ onement for her before the LORD for the issue of her un@@ clean@@ ness .
thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their un@@ clean@@ ness ; that they die not in their un@@ clean@@ ness , when they def@@ ile my tab@@ ern@@ acle that is among them .
this is the law of him that hath an issue , and of him whose seed go@@ eth from him , and is de@@ filed there@@ with ;
and the LORD sp@@ ake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron , when they offered before the LORD , and died ;
and he shall take a cen@@ ser full of burning co@@ als of fire from off the altar before the LORD , and his hands full of sweet inc@@ ense beaten small , and bring it within the V@@ ail :
and he shall put the inc@@ ense upon the fire before the LORD , that the cloud of the inc@@ ense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony , that he die not :
then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering , that is for the people , and bring his blood within the V@@ ail , and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bul@@ lock , and sprink@@ le it upon the mercy seat , and before the mercy seat :
and there shall be no man in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation when he go@@ eth in to make an at@@ onement in the holy place , until he come out , and have made an at@@ onement for himself , and for his household , and for all the congregation of Israel .
and he shall sprink@@ le of the blood upon it with his finger seven times , and clean@@ se it , and hal@@ low it from the un@@ clean@@ ness of the children of Israel .
and the goat shall bear upon him all their ini@@ qu@@ ities unto a land not inhabited : and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness .
for on that day shall the priest make an at@@ onement for you , to clean@@ se you , that ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD .
and this shall be an everlasting statute unto you , to make an at@@ onement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year . and he did as the LORD commanded Moses .
and they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto dev@@ ils , after whom they have gone a wh@@ oring . this shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , I am the LORD your God .
after the do@@ ings of the land of Egypt , where@@ in ye d@@ wel@@ t , shall ye not do : and after the do@@ ings of the land of Can@@ a@@ an , whi@@ ther I bring you , shall ye not do : neither shall ye walk in their ordin@@ ances .
none of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him , to un@@ cover their n@@ ak@@ edness : I am the LORD .
thou shalt not un@@ cover the n@@ ak@@ edness of thy father 's brother , thou shalt not approach to his wife : she is th@@ ine aunt .
thou shalt not un@@ cover the n@@ ak@@ edness of a woman and her daughter , neither shalt thou take her son 's daughter , or her daughter 's daughter , to un@@ cover her n@@ ak@@ edness ; for they are her near kin@@ s@@ women : it is w@@ ick@@ edness .
also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to un@@ cover her n@@ ak@@ edness , as long as she is put apart for her un@@ clean@@ ness .
def@@ ile not ye yourselves in any of these things : for in all these the nations are de@@ filed which I cast out before you :
and the land is de@@ filed : therefore I do visit the ini@@ qu@@ ity thereof upon it , and the land itself vom@@ it@@ eth out her inhabitants .
ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments , and shall not commit any of these ab@@ om@@ inations ; neither any of your own nation , nor any stranger that so@@ jour@@ neth among you :
( for all these ab@@ om@@ inations have the men of the land done , which were before you , and the land is de@@ filed ; )
therefore shall ye keep mine ordin@@ ance , that ye commit not any one of these ab@@ om@@ in@@ able customs , which were committed before you , and that ye def@@ ile not yourselves therein : I am the LORD your God .
speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel , and say unto them , Y@@ e shall be holy : for I the LORD your God am holy .
ye shall fear every man his mother , and his father , and keep my sab@@ baths : I am the LORD your God .
and if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD , ye shall offer it at your own will .
it shall be eaten the same day ye offer it , and on the mor@@ row : and if ought remain until the third day , it shall be burnt in the fire .
therefore every one that e@@ at@@ eth it shall bear his ini@@ qu@@ ity , because he hath prof@@ an@@ ed the hal@@ lowed thing of the LORD : and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
and when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field , neither shalt thou gather the g@@ lean@@ ings of thy harvest .
and thou shalt not g@@ lean thy viney@@ ard , neither shalt thou gather every grap@@ e of thy viney@@ ard ; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger : I am the LORD your God .
thou shalt not hate thy brother in th@@ ine heart : thou shalt in any wise rebu@@ ke thy neighbour , and not suffer sin upon him .
thou shalt not av@@ enge , nor bear any gr@@ udge against the children of thy people , but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy@@ self : I am the LORD .
ye shall keep my statutes . thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind : thou shalt not sow thy field with ming@@ led seed : neither shall a garment ming@@ led of linen and w@@ ool@@ len come upon thee .
and in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof , that it may yield unto you the increase thereof : I am the LORD your God .
ye shall not make any cut@@ tings in your flesh for the dead , nor print any marks upon you : I am the LORD .
do not pro@@ stitute thy daughter , to cause her to be a wh@@ ore ; lest the land fall to wh@@ ore@@ dom , and the land become full of w@@ ick@@ edness .
just balances , just weights , a just ep@@ ha@@ h , and a just H@@ in , shall ye have : I am the LORD your God , which brought you out of the land of Egypt .
therefore shall ye observe all my statutes , and all my judgments , and do them : I am the LORD .
and if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man , when he gi@@ v@@ eth of his seed unto Mol@@ ech , and kill him not :
then I will set my face against that man , and against his family , and will cut him off , and all that go a wh@@ oring after him , to commit wh@@ ore@@ dom with Mol@@ ech , from among their people .
and the soul that tur@@ neth after such as have familiar spirits , and after w@@ izards , to go a wh@@ oring after them , I will even set my face against that soul , and will cut him off from among his people .
for every one that cur@@ set@@ h his father or his mother shall be surely put to death : he hath cur@@ sed his father or his mother ; his blood shall be upon him .
and the man that commit@@ t@@ eth adul@@ tery with another man 's wife , even he that commit@@ t@@ eth adul@@ tery with his neighbour 's wife , the adul@@ ter@@ er and the adul@@ ter@@ ess shall surely be put to death .
and the man that li@@ eth with his father 's wife hath uncovered his father 's n@@ ak@@ edness : both of them shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them .
and if a man lie with his daughter in law , both of them shall surely be put to death : they have wrought confusion ; their blood shall be upon them .
and if a man take a wife and her mother , it is w@@ ick@@ edness : they shall be burnt with fire , both he and they ; that there be no w@@ ick@@ edness among you .
and if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness , and shall un@@ cover her n@@ ak@@ edness ; he hath discovered her fountain , and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood : and both of them shall be cut off from among their people .
and thou shalt not un@@ cover the n@@ ak@@ edness of thy mother 's sister , nor of thy father 's sister : for he un@@ cover@@ eth his near kin : they shall bear their ini@@ qu@@ ity .
and if a man shall take his brother 's wife , it is an un@@ clean thing : he hath uncovered his brother 's n@@ ak@@ edness ; they shall be chil@@ dless .
ye shall therefore keep all my statutes , and all my judgments , and do them : that the land , whi@@ ther I bring you to dwell therein , sp@@ ue you not out .
and ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation , which I cast out before you : for they committed all these things , and therefore I ab@@ hor@@ red them .
but I have said unto you , Y@@ e shall inherit their land , and I will give it unto you to possess it , a land that flow@@ eth with milk and honey : I am the LORD your God , which have separated you from other people .
and ye shall be holy unto me : for I the LORD am holy , and have sever@@ ed you from other people , that ye should be mine .
a man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit , or that is a wizard , shall surely be put to death : they shall stone them with stones : their blood shall be upon them .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Spe@@ ak unto the priests the sons of Aaron , and say unto them , There shall none be de@@ filed for the dead among his people :
they shall be holy unto their God , and not prof@@ ane the name of their God : for the offerings of the LORD made by fire , and the bread of their God , they do offer : therefore they shall be holy .
they shall not take a wife that is a wh@@ ore , or prof@@ ane ; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband : for he is holy unto his God .
thou shalt sancti@@ fy him therefore ; for he off@@ er@@ eth the bread of thy God : he shall be holy unto thee : for I the LORD , which sancti@@ fy you , am holy .
and he that is the high priest among his brethren , upon whose head the ano@@ in@@ ting oil was poured , and that is consec@@ rated to put on the garments , shall not un@@ cover his head , nor ren@@ d his clothes ;
neither shall he go out of the sanctuary , nor prof@@ ane the sanctuary of his God ; for the crown of the ano@@ in@@ ting oil of his God is upon him : I am the LORD .
a widow , or a divorced woman , or prof@@ ane , or an har@@ lot , these shall he not take : but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife .
speak unto Aaron and to his sons , that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel , and that they prof@@ ane not my holy name in those things which they hal@@ low unto me : I am the LORD .
what man soever of the seed of Aaron is a le@@ per , or hath a running issue ; he shall not eat of the holy things , until he be clean . and wh@@ os@@ o touch@@ eth any thing that is un@@ clean by the dead , or a man whose seed go@@ eth from him ;
the soul which hath touched any such shall be un@@ clean until even , and shall not eat of the holy things , unless he wash his flesh with water .
and when the sun is down , he shall be clean , and shall afterward eat of the holy things ; because it is his food .
but if the priest buy any soul with his money , he shall eat of it , and he that is born in his house : they shall eat of his meat .
if the priest 's daughter also be married unto a stranger , she may not eat of an offering of the holy things .
and if a man eat of the holy thing unwit@@ tingly , then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it , and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing .
and they shall not prof@@ ane the holy things of the children of Israel , which they offer unto the LORD ;
blind , or broken , or ma@@ im@@ ed , or having a w@@ en , or s@@ cur@@ vy , or sc@@ ab@@ bed , ye shall not offer these unto the LORD , nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD .
either a bul@@ lock or a lamb that hath any thing super@@ flu@@ ous or lacking in his parts , that may@@ est thou offer for a fre@@ e@@ will offering ; but for a vo@@ w it shall not be accepted .
ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bru@@ ised , or crushed , or broken , or cut ; neither shall ye make any offering thereof in your land .
when a bul@@ lock , or a sheep , or a goat , is brought forth , then it shall be seven days under the dam ; and from the eighth day and th@@ ence@@ forth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD .
on the same day it shall be eaten up ; ye shall leave none of it until the mor@@ row : I am the LORD .
neither shall ye prof@@ ane my holy name ; but I will be hal@@ lowed among the children of Israel : I am the LORD which hal@@ low you ,
six days shall work be done : but the seventh day is the sab@@ bath of rest , an holy convocation ; ye shall do no work therein : it is the sab@@ bath of the LORD in all your dwell@@ ings .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye be come into the land which I give unto you , and shall reap the harvest thereof , then ye shall bring a she@@ af of the fir@@ st@@ fruits of your harvest unto the priest :
and he shall wave the she@@ af before the LORD , to be accepted for you : on the mor@@ row after the sab@@ bath the priest shall wave it .
and the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour ming@@ led with oil , an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet sav@@ our : and the drink offering thereof shall be of wine , the fourth part of an H@@ in .
and ye shall eat neither bread , nor par@@ ched corn , nor green ears , until the self@@ same day that ye have brought an offering unto your God : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwell@@ ings .
ye shall bring out of your hab@@ itations two wave lo@@ aves of two tenth deals : they shall be of fine flour ; they shall be b@@ aken with leav@@ en ; they are the fir@@ st@@ fruits unto the LORD .
then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering , and two lam@@ bs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings .
and ye shall proclaim on the self@@ same day , that it may be an holy convocation unto you : ye shall do no serv@@ ile work therein : it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwell@@ ings throughout your generations .
and when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not make clean rid@@ dance of the corners of thy field when thou re@@ apest , neither shalt thou gather any g@@ leaning of thy harvest : thou shalt leave them unto the poor , and to the stranger : I am the LORD your God .
and ye shall do no work in that same day : for it is a day of at@@ onement , to make an at@@ onement for you before the LORD your God .
for whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day , he shall be cut off from among his people .
ye shall do no manner of work : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwell@@ ings .
beside the sab@@ baths of the LORD , and beside your gifts , and beside all your v@@ ows , and beside all your fre@@ e@@ will offerings , which ye give unto the LORD .
that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in boo@@ ths , when I brought them out of the land of Egypt : I am the LORD your God .
command the children of Israel , that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light , to cause the lamps to burn continually .
without the V@@ ail of the testimony , in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually : it shall be a statute for ever in your generations .
and thou shalt put pure frank@@ inc@@ ense upon each row , that it may be on the bread for a memorial , even an offering made by fire unto the LORD .
every sab@@ bath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually , being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant .
and it shall be Aaron 's and his sons ' ; and they shall eat it in the holy place : for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute .
bring forth him that hath cur@@ sed without the camp ; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head , and let all the congregation stone him .
and if a man cause a bl@@ emish in his neighbour ; as he hath done , so shall it be done to him ;
and he that kill@@ eth a beast , he shall restore it : and he that kill@@ eth a man , he shall be put to death .
ye shall have one manner of law , as well for the stranger , as for one of your own country : for I am the LORD your God .
and Moses sp@@ ake to the children of Israel , that they should bring forth him that had cur@@ sed out of the camp , and stone him with stones . and the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye come into the land which I give you , then shall the land keep a sab@@ bath unto the LORD .
six years thou shalt sow thy field , and six years thou shalt pr@@ une thy viney@@ ard , and gather in the fruit thereof ;
but in the seventh year shall be a sab@@ bath of rest unto the land , a sab@@ bath for the LORD : thou shalt neither sow thy field , nor pr@@ une thy viney@@ ard .
that which grow@@ eth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap , neither gather the grapes of thy vine und@@ ressed : for it is a year of rest unto the land .
and the sab@@ bath of the land shall be meat for you ; for thee , and for thy servant , and for thy maid , and for thy hired servant , and for thy stranger that so@@ jour@@ neth with thee ,
and thou shalt number seven sab@@ baths of years unto thee , seven times seven years ; and the space of the seven sab@@ baths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years .
and ye shall hal@@ low the fif@@ ti@@ eth year , and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof : it shall be a jub@@ ile unto you ; and ye shall return every man unto his possession , and ye shall return every man unto his family .
a jub@@ ile shall that fif@@ ti@@ eth year be unto you : ye shall not sow , neither reap that which grow@@ eth of itself in it , nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine und@@ ressed .
for it is the jub@@ ile ; it shall be holy unto you : ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field .
according to the number of years after the jub@@ ile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour , and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee :
ye shall not therefore op@@ press one another ; but thou shalt fear thy God : for I am the LORD your God .
W@@ herefore ye shall do my statutes , and keep my judgments , and do them ; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety .
and ye shall sow the eighth year , and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year ; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store .
the land shall not be sold for ever : for the land is mine ; for ye are strangers and so@@ jour@@ ners with me .
then let him count the years of the sale thereof , and restore the over@@ plus unto the man to whom he sold it ; that he may return unto his possession .
and if a man sell a dwelling house in a w@@ alled city , then he may re@@ deem it within a whole year after it is sold ; within a full year may he re@@ deem it .
and if it be not re@@ deemed within the space of a full year , then the house that is in the w@@ alled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations : it shall not go out in the jub@@ ile .
but the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country : they may be re@@ deemed , and they shall go out in the jub@@ ile .
but the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold ; for it is their perpetual possession .
and if thy brother be wa@@ x@@ en poor , and fallen in decay with thee ; then thou shalt relieve him : ye@@ a , though he be a stranger , or a so@@ jour@@ ner ; that he may live with thee .
I am the LORD your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , to give you the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and to be your God .
but as an hired servant , and as a so@@ jour@@ ner , he shall be with thee , and shall serve thee unto the year of jub@@ ile :
and then shall he depart from thee , both he and his children with him , and shall return unto his own family , and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return .
both thy bond@@ men , and thy bond@@ m@@ aids , which thou shalt have , shall be of the he@@ a@@ then that are round about you ; of them shall ye buy bond@@ men and bond@@ m@@ aids .
and if a so@@ jour@@ ner or stranger wax rich by thee , and thy brother that dwell@@ eth by him wax poor , and sell himself unto the stranger or so@@ jour@@ ner by thee , or to the stock of the stranger 's family :
for unto me the children of Israel are servants ; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt : I am the LORD your God .
ye shall make you no idols nor gra@@ ven image , neither rear you up a standing image , neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land , to bow down unto it : for I am the LORD your God .
then I will give you rain in due season , and the land shall yield her increase , and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit .
and I will give peace in the land , and ye shall lie down , and none shall make you afraid : and I will rid evil beasts out of the land , neither shall the sword go through your land .
and five of you shall chase an hundred , and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight : and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword .
I am the LORD your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , that ye should not be their bond@@ men ; and I have broken the bands of your y@@ oke , and made you go upright .
I also will do this unto you ; I will even appoint over you terror , consumption , and the burning ague , that shall consume the eyes , and cause sorrow of heart : and ye shall sow your seed in vain , for your enemies shall eat it .
and your strength shall be spent in vain : for your land shall not yield her increase , neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits .
and if ye walk contrary unto me , and will not hear@@ ken unto me ; I will bring seven times more pl@@ agues upon you according to your sins .
I will also send wild beasts among you , which shall rob you of your children , and destroy your cattle , and make you few in number ; and your highways shall be des@@ ol@@ ate .
then will I also walk contrary unto you , and will punish you yet seven times for your sins .
and I will bring a sword upon you , that shall av@@ enge the quarrel of my covenant : and when ye are gathered together within your cities , I will send the pesti@@ l@@ ence among you ; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy .
and ye shall eat the flesh of your sons , and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat .
and I will destroy your high places , and cut down your images , and cast your car@@ cases upon the car@@ cases of your idols , and my soul shall abh@@ or you .
and I will make your cities waste , and bring your sanc@@ tu@@ aries unto des@@ ol@@ ation , and I will not smell the sav@@ our of your sweet od@@ ours .
and I will sc@@ atter you among the he@@ a@@ then , and will draw out a sword after you : and your land shall be des@@ ol@@ ate , and your cities waste .
if they shall confess their ini@@ qu@@ ity , and the ini@@ qu@@ ity of their fathers , with their t@@ resp@@ ass which they t@@ resp@@ assed against me , and that also they have walked contrary unto me ;
and that I also have walked contrary unto them , and have brought them into the land of their enemies ; if then their un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised hearts be hum@@ bled , and they then accept of the punishment of their ini@@ qu@@ ity :
then will I remember my covenant with Jacob , and also my covenant with Isaac , and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember ; and I will remember the land .
these are the statutes and judgments and laws , which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses .
and if it be a beast , where@@ of men bring an offering unto the LORD , all that any man gi@@ v@@ eth of such unto the LORD shall be holy .
he shall not alter it , nor change it , a good for a bad , or a bad for a good : and if he shall at all change beast for beast , then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy .
and if it be any un@@ clean beast , of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD , then he shall present the beast before the priest :
and the priest shall value it , whether it be good or bad : as thou valu@@ est it , who art the priest , so shall it be .
and when a man shall sancti@@ fy his house to be holy unto the LORD , then the priest shall estimate it , whether it be good or bad : as the priest shall estimate it , so shall it stand .
but if he sancti@@ fy his field after the jub@@ ile , then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain , even unto the year of the jub@@ ile , and it shall be abated from thy estimation .
and if he will not re@@ deem the field , or if he have sold the field to another man , it shall not be re@@ deemed any more .
but the field , when it go@@ eth out in the jub@@ ile , shall be holy unto the LORD , as a field devoted ; the possession thereof shall be the priest 's .
only the fir@@ st@@ ling of the beasts , which should be the LORD 's fir@@ st@@ ling , no man shall sancti@@ fy it ; whether it be ox , or sheep : it is the LORD 's .
and concerning the ti@@ the of the herd , or of the flock , even of whatsoever pass@@ eth under the rod , the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD .
and the LORD sp@@ ake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , on the first day of the second month , in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
from twenty years old and upward , all that are able to go forth to war in Israel : thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies .
and they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of the second month , and they declared their pedi@@ grees after their families , by the house of their fathers , according to the number of the names , from twenty years old and upward , by their polls .
these are those that were numbered , which Moses and Aaron numbered , and the princes of Israel , being twelve men : each one was for the house of his fathers .
so were all those that were numbered of the children of Israel , by the house of their fathers , from twenty years old and upward , all that were able to go forth to war in Israel ;
and when the tab@@ ern@@ acle sett@@ eth forward , the Lev@@ ites shall take it down : and when the tab@@ ern@@ acle is to be pit@@ ched , the Lev@@ ites shall set it up : and the stranger that com@@ eth ni@@ gh shall be put to death .
but the Lev@@ ites shall pitch round about the tab@@ ern@@ acle of testimony , that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel : and the Lev@@ ites shall keep the charge of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of testimony .
every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard , with the en@@ sign of their father 's house : far off about the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation shall they pitch .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were thre@@ es@@ core and fourteen thousand and six hundred .
and his host , and those that were numbered thereof , were fifty and four thousand and four hundred .
then the tribe of Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n : and Eli@@ ab the son of Hel@@ on shall be captain of the children of Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n .
and his host , and those that were numbered thereof , were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred .
all that were numbered in the camp of Jud@@ ah were an hundred thousand and four@@ score thousand and six thousand and four hundred , throughout their armies . these shall first set forth .
and his host , and those that were numbered thereof , were forty and six thousand and five hundred .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred .
then the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation shall set forward with the camp of the Lev@@ ites in the midst of the camp : as they enc@@ amp , so shall they set forward , every man in his place by their standards .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were forty thousand and five hundred .
and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were thirty and two thousand and two hundred .

and his host , and those that were numbered of them , were fifty and three thousand and four hundred .
all they that were numbered in the camp of Dan were an hundred thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred . they shall go hind@@ most with their standards .
and Nad@@ ab and A@@ bi@@ hu died before the LORD , when they offered strange fire before the LORD , in the wilderness of Sinai , and they had no children : and Ele@@ az@@ ar and I@@ th@@ am@@ ar minist@@ ered in the priest 's office in the sight of Aaron their father .
bring the tribe of Lev@@ i near , and present them before Aaron the priest , that they may minister unto him .
and they shall keep all the instruments of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , and the charge of the children of Israel , to do the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and thou shalt give the Lev@@ ites unto Aaron and to his sons : they are wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel .
and thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons , and they shall wait on their priest 's office : and the stranger that com@@ eth ni@@ gh shall be put to death .
number the children of Lev@@ i after the house of their fathers , by their families : every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them .
in the number of all the males , from a month old and upward , were eight thousand and six hundred , keeping the charge of the sanctuary .
all that were numbered of the Lev@@ ites , which Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the LORD , throughout their families , all the males from a month old and upward , were twenty and two thousand .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Number all the fir@@ st@@ born of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward , and take the number of their names .
and thou shalt give the money , where@@ with the odd number of them is to be re@@ deemed , unto Aaron and to his sons .
from thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old , all that enter into the host , to do the work in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation .
and when the camp sett@@ eth forward , Aaron shall come , and his sons , and they shall take down the covering V@@ ail , and cover the ark of testimony with it :
and upon the table of sh@@ ew@@ bread they shall spread a cloth of blue , and put there@@ on the dishes , and the spo@@ ons , and the bow@@ ls , and covers to cover with@@ al : and the continual bread shall be there@@ on :
and they shall spread upon them a cloth of scar@@ let , and cover the same with a covering of Bad@@ gers ' skins , and shall put in the st@@ aves thereof .
and they shall take a cloth of blue , and cover the cand@@ les@@ tick of the light , and his lamps , and his t@@ ongs , and his sn@@ u@@ ff@@ dishes , and all the oil vessels thereof , where@@ with they minister unto it :
and upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue , and cover it with a covering of Bad@@ gers ' skins , and shall put to the st@@ aves thereof :
and they shall take all the instruments of ministry , where@@ with they minister in the sanctuary , and put them in a cloth of blue , and cover them with a covering of Bad@@ gers ' skins , and shall put them on a bar :
and they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof , where@@ with they minister about it , even the cens@@ ers , the fl@@ esh@@ hoo@@ ks , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the bas@@ ons , all the vessels of the altar ; and they shall spread upon it a covering of Bad@@ gers ' skins , and put to the st@@ aves of it .
this is the service of the families of the Ger@@ sh@@ on@@ ites , to serve , and for burdens :
and the hang@@ ings of the court , and the hanging for the door of the gate of the court , which is by the tab@@ ern@@ acle and by the altar round about , and their cor@@ ds , and all the instruments of their service , and all that is made for them : so shall they serve .
at the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Ger@@ sh@@ on@@ ites , in all their burdens , and in all their service : and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens .
this is the service of the families of the sons of Ger@@ sh@@ on in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation : and their charge shall be under the hand of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar the son of Aaron the priest .
and the pillars of the court round about , and their sockets , and their pins , and their cor@@ ds , with all their instruments , and with all their service : and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the charge of their burden .
from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old , every one that enter@@ eth into the service , for the work in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation :
from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old , every one that enter@@ eth into the service , for the work in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation ,
from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old , every one that enter@@ eth into the service , for the work in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation ,
both male and female shall ye put out , without the camp shall ye put them ; that they def@@ ile not their camps , in the midst where@@ of I dwell .
and the children of Israel did so , and put them out without the camp : as the LORD sp@@ ake unto Moses , so did the children of Israel .
then they shall confess their sin which they have done : and he shall re@@ comp@@ ense his t@@ resp@@ ass with the principal thereof , and add unto it the fifth part thereof , and give it unto him against whom he hath t@@ resp@@ assed .
but if the man have no kin@@ sman to re@@ comp@@ ense the t@@ resp@@ ass unto , let the t@@ resp@@ ass be re@@ comp@@ en@@ sed unto the LORD , even to the priest ; beside the ram of the at@@ onement , whereby an at@@ onement shall be made for him .
and every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel , which they bring unto the priest , shall be his .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , If any man 's wife go aside , and commit a t@@ resp@@ ass against him ,
and the spirit of jealousy come upon him , and he be jeal@@ ous of his wife , and she be de@@ filed : or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him , and he be jeal@@ ous of his wife , and she be not de@@ filed :
and the priest shall set the woman before the LORD , and un@@ cover the woman 's head , and put the offering of memorial in her hands , which is the jealousy offering : and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that caus@@ eth the curse :
and the priest shall charge her by an oath , and say unto the woman , If no man have lain with thee , and if thou hast not gone aside to un@@ clean@@ ness with another instead of thy husband , be thou free from this bitter water that caus@@ eth the curse :
but if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband , and if thou be de@@ filed , and some man have lain with thee beside th@@ ine husband :
and this water that caus@@ eth the curse shall go into thy bow@@ els , to make thy belly to s@@ well , and thy thi@@ gh to rot : and the woman shall say , A@@ men , amen .
and the priest shall write these cur@@ ses in a book , and he shall b@@ lot them out with the bitter water :
and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that caus@@ eth the curse : and the water that caus@@ eth the curse shall enter into her , and become bitter .
then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman 's hand , and shall wave the offering before the LORD , and offer it upon the altar :
and the priest shall take an handful of the offering , even the memorial thereof , and burn it upon the altar , and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water .
and if the woman be not de@@ filed , but be clean ; then she shall be free , and shall conceive seed .
all the days of the vo@@ w of his separation there shall no r@@ as@@ or come upon his head : until the days be fulfilled , in the which he separ@@ at@@ eth himself unto the LORD , he shall be holy , and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow .
and on the eighth day he shall bring two tur@@ tles , or two young pig@@ eons , to the priest , to the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation :
and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , and make an at@@ onement for him , for that he sin@@ ned by the dead , and shall hal@@ low his head that same day .
and he shall consec@@ rate unto the LORD the days of his separation , and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a t@@ resp@@ ass offering : but the days that were before shall be lost , because his separation was de@@ filed .
and he shall offer his offering unto the LORD , one he lamb of the first year without bl@@ emish for a burnt offering , and one e@@ we lamb of the first year without bl@@ emish for a sin offering , and one ram without bl@@ emish for peace offerings ,
and a basket of un@@ leav@@ ened bread , cakes of fine flour ming@@ led with oil , and w@@ af@@ ers of un@@ leav@@ ened bread ano@@ inted with oil , and their meat offering , and their drink offerings .
and the priest shall take the so@@ dden shoulder of the ram , and one un@@ leav@@ ened cake out of the basket , and one un@@ leav@@ ened w@@ af@@ er , and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazar@@ ite , after the hair of his separation is sha@@ ven :
and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD : this is holy for the priest , with the wave breast and he@@ ave shoulder : and after that the Nazar@@ ite may drink wine .
and they brought their offering before the LORD , six covered w@@ agons , and twelve ox@@ en ; a wagon for two of the princes , and for each one an ox : and they brought them before the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and four w@@ agons and eight ox@@ en he gave unto the sons of Mer@@ ari , according unto their service , under the hand of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar the son of Aaron the priest .
but unto the sons of Ko@@ hath he gave none : because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders .
and the princes offered for dedic@@ ating of the altar in the day that it was ano@@ inted , even the princes offered their offering before the altar .
and the LORD said unto Moses , They shall offer their offering , each prince on his day , for the dedic@@ ating of the altar .
and his offering was one silver charger , the weight thereof was an hundred and thirty she@@ k@@ els , one silver bowl of seventy she@@ k@@ els , after the she@@ kel of the sanctuary ; both of them were full of fine flour ming@@ led with oil for a meat offering :
and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of N@@ ah@@ sh@@ on the son of Am@@ min@@ ad@@ ab .

and for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two ox@@ en , five r@@ ams , five he goats , five lam@@ bs of the first year : this was the offering of Ah@@ ira the son of En@@ an .
this was the dedication of the altar , in the day when it was ano@@ inted , by the princes of Israel : twelve char@@ gers of silver , twelve silver bow@@ ls , twelve spo@@ ons of gold :
the golden spo@@ ons were twelve , full of inc@@ ense , weighing ten she@@ k@@ els api@@ ece , after the she@@ kel of the sanctuary : all the gold of the spo@@ ons was an hundred and twenty she@@ k@@ els .
all the ox@@ en for the burnt offering were twelve bul@@ locks , the r@@ ams twelve , the lam@@ bs of the first year twelve , with their meat offering : and the kids of the goats for sin offering twelve .
and this work of the cand@@ les@@ tick was of beaten gold , unto the shaft thereof , unto the flowers thereof , was beaten work : according unto the pattern which the LORD had sh@@ ew@@ ed Moses , so he made the cand@@ les@@ tick .
and thou shalt bring the Lev@@ ites before the LORD : and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Lev@@ ites :
and Aaron shall offer the Lev@@ ites before the LORD for an offering of the children of Israel , that they may execute the service of the LORD .
and thou shalt set the Lev@@ ites before Aaron , and before his sons , and offer them for an offering unto the LORD .
and after that shall the Lev@@ ites go in to do the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation : and thou shalt clean@@ se them , and offer them for an offering .
for all the fir@@ st@@ born of the children of Israel are mine , both man and beast : on the day that I smo@@ te every fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt I sancti@@ fied them for myself .
and Moses , and Aaron , and all the congregation of the children of Israel , did to the Lev@@ ites according unto all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Lev@@ ites , so did the children of Israel unto them .
and after that went the Lev@@ ites in to do their service in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation before Aaron , and before his sons : as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Lev@@ ites , so did they unto them .
this is it that belong@@ eth unto the Lev@@ ites : from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation :
but shall minister with their brethren in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , to keep the charge , and shall do no service . thus shalt thou do unto the Lev@@ ites touching their charge .
and the LORD sp@@ ake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai , in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt , saying ,
and there were certain men , who were de@@ filed by the dead body of a man , that they could not keep the pas@@ sover on that day : and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day :
and those men said unto him , We are de@@ filed by the dead body of a man : W@@ herefore are we kept back , that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel ?
speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If any man of you or of your post@@ er@@ ity shall be un@@ clean by reason of a dead body , or be in a journey af@@ ar off , yet he shall keep the pas@@ sover unto the LORD .
they shall leave none of it unto the morning , nor break any bone of it : according to all the ordin@@ ances of the pas@@ sover they shall keep it .
so it was al@@ way : the cloud covered it by day , and the appearance of fire by night .
and when the cloud was taken up from the tab@@ ern@@ acle , then after that the children of Israel jour@@ ne@@ yed : and in the place where the cloud ab@@ ode , there the children of Israel pit@@ ched their tents .
at the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel jour@@ ne@@ yed , and at the commandment of the LORD they pit@@ ched : as long as the cloud ab@@ ode upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle they rested in their tents .
and when the cloud tar@@ ried long upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle many days , then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD , and jour@@ ne@@ yed not .
and so it was , when the cloud ab@@ ode from even unto the morning , and that the cloud was taken up in the morning , then they jour@@ ne@@ yed : whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up , they jour@@ ne@@ yed .
or whether it were two days , or a month , or a year , that the cloud tar@@ ried upon the tab@@ ern@@ acle , remaining there@@ on , the children of Israel ab@@ ode in their tents , and jour@@ ne@@ yed not : but when it was taken up , they jour@@ ne@@ yed .
when ye blow an alarm the second time , then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey : they shall blow an alarm for their journeys .
and if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that op@@ pres@@ set@@ h you , then ye shall blow an alarm with the trum@@ pets ; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God , and ye shall be saved from your enemies .
and the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai ; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Par@@ an .
in the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Jud@@ ah according to their armies : and over his host was N@@ ah@@ sh@@ on the son of Am@@ min@@ ad@@ ab .
and the tab@@ ern@@ acle was taken down ; and the sons of Ger@@ sh@@ on and the sons of Mer@@ ari set forward , bearing the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and the standard of the camp of Re@@ ub@@ en set forward according to their armies : and over his host was Eliz@@ ur the son of She@@ de@@ ur .
and the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites set forward , bearing the sanctuary : and the other did set up the tab@@ ern@@ acle against they came .
and the standard of the camp of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im set forward according to their armies : and over his host was Elis@@ h@@ ama the son of Am@@ mi@@ hud .
thus were the jour@@ ne@@ y@@ ings of the children of Israel according to their armies , when they set forward .
and Moses said unto Hob@@ ab , the son of R@@ agu@@ el the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ite , Moses ' father in law , We are jour@@ ne@@ ying unto the place of which the LORD said , I will give it you : come thou with us , and we will do thee good : for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel .
and he said unto him , I will not go ; but I will depart to mine own land , and to my kind@@ red .
and he said , Leave us not , I pray thee ; for@@ as@@ much as thou know@@ est how we are to enc@@ amp in the wilderness , and thou may@@ est be to us instead of eyes .
and they departed from the mount of the LORD three days ' journey : and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days ' journey , to search out a resting place for them .
and the mix@@ t multitude that was among them fell a lu@@ sting : and the children of Israel also we@@ pt again , and said , Who shall give us flesh to eat ?
we remember the fish , which we did eat in Egypt freely ; the c@@ uc@@ um@@ bers , and the mel@@ ons , and the le@@ eks , and the on@@ ions , and the gar@@ l@@ ick :
but our soul is dried away : there is nothing at all , beside this man@@ na , before our eyes .
and the man@@ na was as cor@@ i@@ ander seed , and the colour thereof as the colour of b@@ del@@ li@@ um .
and the people went about , and gathered it , and ground it in mills , or beat it in a mortar , and baked it in p@@ ans , and made cakes of it : and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil .
then Moses heard the people we@@ ep throughout their families , every man in the door of his tent : and the anger of the LORD was kind@@ led greatly ; Moses also was dis@@ pleased .
wh@@ ence should I have flesh to give unto all this people ? for they we@@ ep unto me , saying , Gi@@ ve us flesh , that we may eat .
and if thou deal thus with me , kill me , I pray thee , out of hand , if I have found favour in thy sight ; and let me not see my w@@ ret@@ ch@@ edness .
and the LORD said unto Moses , G@@ ather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel , whom thou know@@ est to be the elders of the people , and officers over them ; and bring them unto the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , that they may stand there with thee .
and I will come down and talk with thee there : and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee , and will put it upon them ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee , that thou bear it not thy@@ self alone .
and Moses said , The people , among whom I am , are six hundred thousand foot@@ men ; and thou hast said , I will give them flesh , that they may eat a whole month .
shall the f@@ locks and the herds be sl@@ ain for them , to suffice them ? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them , to suffice them ?
and the LORD said unto Moses , Is the LORD 's hand wa@@ xed short ? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not .
and the LORD came down in a cloud , and sp@@ ake unto him , and took of the spirit that was upon him , and gave it unto the seventy elders : and it came to pass , that , when the spirit rested upon them , they prophe@@ si@@ ed , and did not cease .
and the people stood up all that day , and all that night , and all the next day , and they gathered the qu@@ ails : he that gathered least gathered ten hom@@ ers : and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp .
and while the flesh was yet between their teeth , ere it was chew@@ ed , the wrath of the LORD was kind@@ led against the people , and the LORD smo@@ te the people with a very great plague .
and they said , H@@ ath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses ? hath he not spoken also by us ? and the LORD heard it .
and the LORD sp@@ ake suddenly unto Moses , and unto Aaron , and unto Mi@@ ri@@ am , Come out ye three unto the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation . and they three came out .
and the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud , and stood in the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and called Aaron and Mi@@ ri@@ am : and they both came forth .
and he said , He@@ ar now my words : if there be a prophet among you , I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision , and will speak unto him in a dream .
with him will I speak mouth to mouth , even apparently , and not in dark speeches ; and the simil@@ itude of the LORD shall he behold : W@@ herefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses ?
and the cloud departed from off the tab@@ ern@@ acle ; and , behold , Mi@@ ri@@ am became le@@ pr@@ ous , white as snow : and Aaron looked upon Mi@@ ri@@ am , and , behold , she was le@@ pr@@ ous .
and they came unto the bro@@ ok of E@@ sh@@ col , and cut down from th@@ ence a branch with one cluster of grapes , and they bare it between two upon a staff ; and they brought of the p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates , and of the fi@@ gs .
and all the congregation lifted up their voice , and cried ; and the people we@@ pt that night .
and all the children of Israel mur@@ mu@@ red against Moses and against Aaron : and the whole congregation said unto them , W@@ ould God that we had died in the land of Egypt ! or would God we had died in this wilderness !
then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel .
and Joshua the son of N@@ un , and Cal@@ eb the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h , which were of them that searched the land , rent their clothes :
only rebel not ye against the LORD , neither fear ye the people of the land ; for they are bread for us : their defence is departed from them , and the LORD is with us : fear them not .
but all the congregation b@@ ade stone them with stones . and the glory of the LORD appeared in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation before all the children of Israel .
and the LORD said unto Moses , How long will this people provoke me ? and how long will it be ere they believe me , for all the signs which I have sh@@ ew@@ ed among them ?
now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man , then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak , saying ,
the LORD is long@@ suffering , and of great mercy , for@@ giving ini@@ qu@@ ity and trans@@ g@@ ression , and by no means clearing the guilty , visiting the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation .
because all those men which have seen my glory , and my miracles , which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness , and have tempted me now these ten times , and have not hear@@ k@@ ened to my voice ;
say unto them , As truly as I live , sa@@ ith the LORD , as ye have spoken in mine ears , so will I do to you :
your car@@ cases shall fall in this wilderness ; and all that were numbered of you , according to your whole number , from twenty years old and upward , which have mur@@ mu@@ red against me ,
after the number of the days in which ye searched the land , even forty days , each day for a year , shall ye bear your ini@@ qu@@ ities , even forty years , and ye shall know my breach of promise .
I the LORD have said , I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation , that are gathered together against me : in this wilderness they shall be consumed , and there they shall die .
and the men , which Moses sent to search the land , who returned , and made all the congregation to mur@@ mur against him , by bringing up a slan@@ der upon the land ,
even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land , died by the plague before the LORD .
and Moses said , W@@ herefore now do ye trans@@ gress the commandment of the LORD ? but it shall not prosper .
then the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites came down , and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites which d@@ wel@@ t in that hill , and smo@@ te them , and dis@@ com@@ f@@ ited them , even unto Hor@@ ma@@ h .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye be come into the land of your hab@@ itations , which I give unto you ,
then shall he that off@@ er@@ eth his offering unto the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour ming@@ led with the fourth part of an H@@ in of oil .
and the fourth part of an H@@ in of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice , for one lamb .
or for a ram , thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour ming@@ led with the third part of an H@@ in of oil .
and when thou prepa@@ rest a bul@@ lock for a burnt offering , or for a sacrifice in performing a vo@@ w , or peace offerings unto the LORD :
and if a stranger so@@ jour@@ n with you , or wh@@ oso@@ ever be among you in your generations , and will offer an offering made by fire , of a sweet sav@@ our unto the LORD ; as ye do , so he shall do .
one ordin@@ ance shall be both for you of the congregation , and also for the stranger that so@@ jour@@ neth with you , an ordin@@ ance for ever in your generations : as ye are , so shall the stranger be before the LORD .
and the priest shall make an at@@ onement for all the congregation of the children of Israel , and it shall be forgiven them ; for it is ignorance : and they shall bring their offering , a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD , and their sin offering before the LORD , for their ignorance :
and it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel , and the stranger that so@@ jour@@ neth among them ; seeing all the people were in ignorance .
and if any soul sin through ignorance , then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering .
but the soul that do@@ eth ought presu@@ mp@@ tu@@ ously , whether he be born in the land , or a stranger , the same repro@@ ach@@ eth the LORD ; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people .
speak unto the children of Israel , and bid them that they make them fring@@ es in the borders of their garments throughout their generations , and that they put upon the fring@@ e of the borders a rib@@ band of blue :
I am the LORD your God , which brought you out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : I am the LORD your God .
and they rose up before Moses , with certain of the children of Israel , two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly , famous in the congregation , men of renow@@ n :
seem@@ eth it but a small thing unto you , that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel , to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the LORD , and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them ?
and he hath brought thee near to him , and all thy brethren the sons of Lev@@ i with thee : and seek ye the priesthood also ?
for which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the LORD : and what is Aaron , that ye mur@@ mur against him ?
is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that flow@@ eth with milk and honey , to kill us in the wilderness , except thou make thy@@ self altogether a prince over us ?
moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that flow@@ eth with milk and honey , or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards : wil@@ t thou put out the eyes of these men ? we will not come up .
and Moses said unto Kor@@ ah , Be thou and all thy company before the LORD , thou , and they , and Aaron , to mor@@ row :
and take every man his cen@@ ser , and put inc@@ ense in them , and bring ye before the LORD every man his cen@@ ser , two hundred and fifty cens@@ ers ; thou also , and Aaron , each of you his cen@@ ser .
and they fell upon their faces , and said , O God , the God of the spirits of all flesh , shall one man sin , and wil@@ t thou be w@@ ro@@ th with all the congregation ?
and he sp@@ ake unto the congregation , saying , De@@ part , I pray you , from the tents of these wicked men , and touch nothing of theirs , lest ye be consumed in all their sins .
so they G@@ at up from the tab@@ ern@@ acle of Kor@@ ah , Da@@ than , and A@@ bir@@ am , on every side : and Da@@ than and A@@ bir@@ am came out , and stood in the door of their tents , and their wives , and their sons , and their little children .
but if the LORD make a new thing , and the earth open her mouth , and swallow them up , with all that ap@@ per@@ tain unto them , and they go down quick into the pit ; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD .
and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up , and their houses , and all the men that ap@@ per@@ tained unto Kor@@ ah , and all their goods .
they , and all that ap@@ per@@ tained to them , went down alive into the pit , and the earth closed upon them : and they perished from among the congregation .
and there came out a fire from the LORD , and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered inc@@ ense .
the cens@@ ers of these sinners against their own souls , let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar : for they offered them before the LORD , therefore they are hal@@ lowed : and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel .
but on the mor@@ row all the congregation of the children of Israel mur@@ mu@@ red against Moses and against Aaron , saying , Y@@ e have killed the people of the LORD .
get you up from among this congregation , that I may consume them as in a moment . and they fell upon their faces .
and Moses said unto Aaron , Take a cen@@ ser , and put fire therein from off the altar , and put on inc@@ ense , and go quickly unto the congregation , and make an at@@ onement for them : for there is wrath gone out from the LORD ; the plague is begun .
and Aaron took as Moses commanded , and ran into the midst of the congregation ; and , behold , the plague was begun among the people : and he put on inc@@ ense , and made an at@@ onement for the people .
and thou shalt lay them up in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation before the testimony , where I will meet with you .
and Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel : and they looked , and took every man his rod .
and the LORD said unto Moses , B@@ ring Aaron 's rod again before the testimony , to be kept for a token against the rebels ; and thou shalt quite take away their mur@@ mur@@ ings from me , that they die not .
and the children of Israel sp@@ ake unto Moses , saying , Be@@ hold , we die , we perish , we all perish .
and thy brethren also of the tribe of Lev@@ i , the tribe of thy father , bring thou with thee , that they may be joined unto thee , and minister unto thee : but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of witness .
and they shall keep thy charge , and the charge of all the tab@@ ern@@ acle : only they shall not come ni@@ gh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar , that neither they , nor ye also , die .
and they shall be joined unto thee , and keep the charge of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , for all the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle : and a stranger shall not come ni@@ gh unto you .
and whatsoever is first ripe in the land , which they shall bring unto the LORD , shall be th@@ ine ; every one that is clean in th@@ ine house shall eat of it .
every thing that open@@ eth the matrix in all flesh , which they bring unto the LORD , whether it be of men or beasts , shall be th@@ ine : nevertheless the fir@@ st@@ born of man shalt thou surely re@@ deem , and the fir@@ st@@ ling of un@@ clean beasts shalt thou re@@ deem .
and those that are to be re@@ deemed from a month old shalt thou re@@ deem , according to th@@ ine estimation , for the money of five she@@ k@@ els , after the she@@ kel of the sanctuary , which is twenty ger@@ ahs .
and the LORD sp@@ ake unto Aaron , Th@@ ou shalt have no inheritance in their land , neither shalt thou have any part among them : I am thy part and th@@ ine inheritance among the children of Israel .
but the Lev@@ ites shall do the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , and they shall bear their ini@@ qu@@ ity : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations , that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance .
but the ti@@ thes of the children of Israel , which they offer as an he@@ ave offering unto the LORD , I have given to the Lev@@ ites to inherit : therefore I have said unto them , Am@@ ong the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance .
thus speak unto the Lev@@ ites , and say unto them , When ye take of the children of Israel the ti@@ thes which I have given you from them for your inheritance , then ye shall offer up an he@@ ave offering of it for the LORD , even a tenth part of the ti@@ the .
thus ye also shall offer an he@@ ave offering unto the LORD of all your ti@@ thes , which ye receive of the children of Israel ; and ye shall give thereof the LORD 's he@@ ave offering to Aaron the priest .
and ye shall eat it in every place , ye and your households : for it is your reward for your service in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation .
this is the ordin@@ ance of the law which the LORD hath commanded , saying , Spe@@ ak unto the children of Israel , that they bring thee a red hei@@ fer without spot , where@@ in is no bl@@ emish , and upon which never came y@@ oke :
and Ele@@ az@@ ar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger , and sprink@@ le of her blood directly before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation seven times :
and one shall burn the hei@@ fer in his sight ; her skin , and her flesh , and her blood , with her d@@ ung , shall he burn :
and the priest shall take c@@ edar wood , and h@@ ys@@ so@@ p , and scar@@ let , and cast it into the midst of the burning of the hei@@ fer .
then the priest shall wash his clothes , and he shall ba@@ the his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be un@@ clean until the even .
and he that bur@@ neth her shall wash his clothes in water , and ba@@ the his flesh in water , and shall be un@@ clean until the even .
and he that gather@@ eth the ashes of the hei@@ fer shall wash his clothes , and be un@@ clean until the even : and it shall be unto the children of Israel , and unto the stranger that so@@ jour@@ neth among them , for a statute for ever .
he shall puri@@ fy himself with it on the third day , and on the seventh day he shall be clean : but if he puri@@ fy not himself the third day , then the seventh day he shall not be clean .
and wh@@ oso@@ ever touch@@ eth one that is sl@@ ain with a sword in the open fields , or a dead body , or a bone of a man , or a grave , shall be un@@ clean seven days .
and the clean person shall sprink@@ le upon the un@@ clean on the third day , and on the seventh day : and on the seventh day he shall puri@@ fy himself , and wash his clothes , and ba@@ the himself in water , and shall be clean at even .
and it shall be a perpetual statute unto them , that he that sprink@@ let@@ h the water of separation shall wash his clothes ; and he that touch@@ eth the water of separation shall be un@@ clean until even .
then came the children of Israel , even the whole congregation , into the desert of Z@@ in in the first month : and the people ab@@ ode in Kad@@ esh ; and Mi@@ ri@@ am died there , and was buried there .
and why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness , that we and our cattle should die there ?
and Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock , and he said unto them , He@@ ar now , ye rebels ; must we fetch you water out of this rock ?
and Moses lifted up his hand , and with his rod he smo@@ te the rock twice : and the water came out ab@@ und@@ antly , and the congregation drank , and their beasts also .
and when we cried unto the LORD , he heard our voice , and sent an angel , and hath brought us forth out of Egypt : and , behold , we are in Kad@@ esh , a city in the utter@@ most of thy border :
and E@@ dom said unto him , Th@@ ou shalt not pass by me , lest I come out against thee with the sword .
and he said , Th@@ ou shalt not go through . and E@@ dom came out against him with much people , and with a strong hand .
and the children of Israel , even the whole congregation , jour@@ ne@@ yed from Kad@@ esh , and came unto mount H@@ or .
and the LORD sp@@ ake unto Moses and Aaron in mount H@@ or , by the coast of the land of E@@ dom , saying ,
and strip Aaron of his garments , and put them upon Ele@@ az@@ ar his son : and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people , and shall die there .
and when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead , they mour@@ ned for Aaron thirty days , even all the house of Israel .
and when king Ara@@ d the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , which d@@ wel@@ t in the south , heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies ; then he fought against Israel , and took some of them prisoners .
and Israel vowed a vo@@ w unto the LORD , and said , If thou wil@@ t indeed deliver this people into my hand , then I will utterly destroy their cities .
and the LORD hear@@ k@@ ened to the voice of Israel , and delivered up the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites ; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities : and he called the name of the place Hor@@ ma@@ h .
and the people sp@@ ake against God , and against Moses , W@@ herefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness ? for there is no bread , neither is there any water ; and our soul lo@@ athe@@ th this light bread .
therefore the people came to Moses , and said , We have sin@@ ned , for we have spoken against the LORD , and against thee ; pray unto the LORD , that he take away the ser@@ p@@ ents from us . and Moses prayed for the people .
and from th@@ ence they went to Be@@ er : that is the well where@@ of the LORD sp@@ ake unto Moses , G@@ ather the people together , and I will give them water .
and from Bam@@ o@@ th in the valley , that is in the country of Mo@@ ab , to the top of Pis@@ g@@ ah , which loo@@ ket@@ h toward Jes@@ him@@ on .
and Si@@ hon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border : but Si@@ hon gathered all his people together , and went out against Israel into the wilderness : and he came to Ja@@ haz , and fought against Israel .
and Israel smo@@ te him with the edge of the sword , and possessed his land from Ar@@ non unto Jab@@ bo@@ k , even unto the children of Am@@ mon : for the border of the children of Am@@ mon was strong .
for H@@ esh@@ bon was the city of Si@@ hon the king of the A@@ mor@@ ites , who had fought against the former king of Mo@@ ab , and taken all his land out of his hand , even unto Ar@@ non .
we have shot at them ; H@@ esh@@ bon is perished even unto Di@@ bon , and we have laid them waste even unto N@@ op@@ ha@@ h , which re@@ ach@@ eth unto Me@@ deb@@ a .
and they turned and went up by the way of Bash@@ an : and O@@ g the king of Bash@@ an went out against them , he , and all his people , to the battle at E@@ dre@@ i .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Fe@@ ar him not : for I have delivered him into thy hand , and all his people , and his land ; and thou shalt do to him as thou did@@ st unto Si@@ hon king of the A@@ mor@@ ites , which d@@ wel@@ t at H@@ esh@@ bon .
and Mo@@ ab was sore afraid of the people , because they were many : and Mo@@ ab was distressed because of the children of Israel .
and Mo@@ ab said unto the elders of Mi@@ dian , Now shall this company l@@ ick up all that are round about us , as the ox l@@ ick@@ eth up the grass of the field . and Bal@@ ak the son of Zi@@ pp@@ or was king of the Mo@@ ab@@ ites at that time .
and the elders of Mo@@ ab and the elders of Mi@@ dian departed with the rewards of div@@ ination in their hand ; and they came unto Bal@@ a@@ am , and sp@@ ake unto him the words of Bal@@ ak .
and he said unto them , Lodge here this night , and I will bring you word again , as the LORD shall speak unto me : and the princes of Mo@@ ab ab@@ ode with Bal@@ a@@ am .
behold , there is a people come out of Egypt , which cover@@ eth the face of the earth : come now , curse me them ; per@@ adventure I shall be able to overcome them , and drive them out .
and God said unto Bal@@ a@@ am , Th@@ ou shalt not go with them ; thou shalt not curse the people : for they are blessed .
and Bal@@ a@@ am rose up in the morning , and said unto the princes of Bal@@ ak , Get you into your land : for the LORD ref@@ us@@ eth to give me leave to go with you .
and they came to Bal@@ a@@ am , and said to him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith Bal@@ ak the son of Zi@@ pp@@ or , Let nothing , I pray thee , hinder thee from coming unto me :
for I will promote thee unto very great honour , and I will do whatsoever thou say@@ est unto me : come therefore , I pray thee , curse me this people .
now therefore , I pray you , tar@@ ry ye also here this night , that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more .
and God came unto Bal@@ a@@ am at night , and said unto him , If the men come to call thee , rise up , and go with them ; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee , that shalt thou do .
and God 's anger was kind@@ led because he went : and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him . now he was riding upon his ass , and his two servants were with him .
and the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and the ass turned aside out of the way , and went into the field : and Bal@@ a@@ am smo@@ te the ass , to turn her into the way .
but the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards , a wall being on this side , and a wall on that side .
and when the ass saw the angel of the LORD , she thrust herself unto the wall , and crushed Bal@@ a@@ am 's foot against the wall : and he smo@@ te her again .
and the LORD opened the mouth of the ass , and she said unto Bal@@ a@@ am , What have I done unto thee , that thou hast sm@@ it@@ ten me these three times ?
and the ass said unto Bal@@ a@@ am , Am not I th@@ ine ass , upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was th@@ ine unto this day ? was I ever won@@ t to do so unto thee ? and he said , N@@ ay .
then the LORD opened the eyes of Bal@@ a@@ am , and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and he bowed down his head , and fell flat on his face .
and the angel of the LORD said unto Bal@@ a@@ am , Go with the men : but only the word that I shall speak unto thee , that thou shalt speak . so Bal@@ a@@ am went with the princes of Bal@@ ak .
and when Bal@@ ak heard that Bal@@ a@@ am was come , he went out to meet him unto a city of Mo@@ ab , which is in the border of Ar@@ non , which is in the utmost coast .
and Bal@@ a@@ am said unto Bal@@ ak , L@@ o , I am come unto thee : have I now any power at all to say any thing ? the word that God put@@ t@@ eth in my mouth , that shall I speak .
and Bal@@ a@@ am said unto Bal@@ ak , Stand by thy burnt offering , and I will go : per@@ adventure the LORD will come to meet me : and whatsoever he sh@@ ew@@ eth me I will tell thee . and he went to an high place .
and the LORD put a word in Bal@@ a@@ am 's mouth , and said , Return unto Bal@@ ak , and thus thou shalt speak .
and he returned unto him , and , lo , he stood by his burnt sacrifice , he , and all the princes of Mo@@ ab .
for from the top of the rocks I see him , and from the hills I behold him : lo , the people shall dwell alone , and shall not be reck@@ oned among the nations .
who can count the dust of Jacob , and the number of the fourth part of Israel ? let me die the death of the righteous , and let my last end be like his !
and Bal@@ ak said unto him , Come , I pray thee , with me unto another place , from wh@@ ence thou may@@ est see them : thou shalt see but the utmost part of them , and shalt not see them all : and curse me them from th@@ ence .
and when he came to him , behold , he stood by his burnt offering , and the princes of Mo@@ ab with him . and Bal@@ ak said unto him , What hath the LORD spoken ?
and he took up his parable , and said , R@@ ise up , Bal@@ ak , and hear ; hear@@ ken unto me , thou son of Zi@@ pp@@ or :
surely there is no enchan@@ tment against Jacob , neither is there any div@@ ination against Israel : according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel , What hath God wrought !
and Bal@@ ak said unto Bal@@ a@@ am , Come , I pray thee , I will bring thee unto another place ; per@@ adventure it will please God that thou may@@ est curse me them from th@@ ence .
and when Bal@@ a@@ am saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel , he went not , as at other times , to seek for enchan@@ tments , but he set his face toward the wilderness .
and he took up his parable , and said , Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Be@@ or hath said , and the man whose eyes are open hath said :
and Bal@@ ak 's anger was kind@@ led against Bal@@ a@@ am , and he smo@@ te his hands together : and Bal@@ ak said unto Bal@@ a@@ am , I called thee to curse mine enemies , and , behold , thou hast altogether blessed them these three times .
therefore now flee thou to thy place : I thought to promote thee unto great honour ; but , lo , the LORD hath kept thee back from honour .
and he took up his parable , and said , Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Be@@ or hath said , and the man whose eyes are open hath said :
and when he looked on A@@ mal@@ ek , he took up his parable , and said , A@@ mal@@ ek was the first of the nations ; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever .
and they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods : and the people did eat , and bowed down to their gods .
and Israel joined himself unto Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ pe@@ or : and the anger of the LORD was kind@@ led against Israel .
and Moses said unto the judges of Israel , S@@ lay ye every one his men that were joined unto Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ pe@@ or .
Ph@@ ine@@ has , the son of Ele@@ az@@ ar , the son of Aaron the priest , hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel , while he was z@@ eal@@ ous for my sake among them , that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy .
and he shall have it , and his seed after him , even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood ; because he was z@@ eal@@ ous for his God , and made an at@@ onement for the children of Israel .
and the sons of Eli@@ ab ; Nem@@ u@@ el , and Da@@ than , and A@@ bir@@ am . this is that Da@@ than and A@@ bir@@ am , which were famous in the congregation , who stro@@ ve against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Kor@@ ah , when they stro@@ ve against the LORD :
and Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had the son of H@@ ep@@ her had no sons , but daughters : and the names of the daughters of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had were Mah@@ lah , and Noah , H@@ og@@ lah , Mil@@ ca@@ h , and Tir@@ z@@ ah .
these were the numbered of the children of Israel , six hundred thousand and a thousand seven hundred and thirty .
to many thou shalt give the more inheritance , and to few thou shalt give the less inheritance : to every one shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him .
notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot : according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit .
and the name of Am@@ ram 's wife was Jo@@ che@@ bed , the daughter of Lev@@ i , whom her mother bare to Lev@@ i in Egypt : and she bare unto Am@@ ram Aaron and Moses , and Mi@@ ri@@ am their sister .
and those that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand , all males from a month old and upward : for they were not numbered among the children of Israel , because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel .
these are they that were numbered by Moses and Ele@@ az@@ ar the priest , who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Mo@@ ab by Jordan near Jer@@ ich@@ o .
but among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered , when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai .
for the LORD had said of them , They shall surely die in the wilderness . and there was not left a man of them , save Cal@@ eb the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h , and Joshua the son of N@@ un .
our father died in the wilderness , and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Kor@@ ah ; but died in his own sin , and had no sons .
why should the name of our father be done away from among his family , because he hath no son ? give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father .
and thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a man die , and have no son , then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter .
and if his father have no brethren , then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kin@@ sman that is next to him of his family , and he shall possess it : and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment , as the LORD commanded Moses .
and the LORD said unto Moses , Get thee up into this mount Ab@@ ari@@ m , and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel .
let the LORD , the God of the spirits of all flesh , set a man over the congregation ,
which may go out before them , and which may go in before them , and which may lead them out , and which may bring them in ; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd .
and he laid his hands upon him , and gave him a charge , as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses .
command the children of Israel , and say unto them , My offering , and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire , for a sweet sav@@ our unto me , shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season .
and a tenth part of an ep@@ ha@@ h of flour for a meat offering , ming@@ led with the fourth part of an H@@ in of beaten oil .
it is a continual burnt offering , which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet sav@@ our , a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD .
and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even : as the meat offering of the morning , and as the drink offering thereof , thou shalt offer it , a sacrifice made by fire , of a sweet sav@@ our unto the LORD .
and a several tenth deal of flour ming@@ led with oil for a meat offering unto one lamb ; for a burnt offering of a sweet sav@@ our , a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD .
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shall be offered , beside the continual burnt offering , and his drink offering .
and in the fif@@ teenth day of this month is the feast : seven days shall un@@ leav@@ ened bread be eaten .
but ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering unto the LORD ; two young bul@@ locks , and one ram , and seven lam@@ bs of the first year : they shall be unto you without bl@@ emish :
also in the day of the fir@@ st@@ fruits , when ye bring a new meat offering unto the LORD , after your weeks be out , ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no serv@@ ile work :
but ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet sav@@ our unto the LORD ; two young bul@@ locks , one ram , seven lam@@ bs of the first year ;
and in the seventh month , on the first day of the month , ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no serv@@ ile work : it is a day of blowing the trum@@ pets unto you .
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering , to make an at@@ onement for you :
and ye shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an holy convocation ; and ye shall aff@@ l@@ ict your souls : ye shall not do any work therein :
but ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD for a sweet sav@@ our ; one young bul@@ lock , one ram , and seven lam@@ bs of the first year ; they shall be unto you without bl@@ emish :
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , his meat offering , and his drink offering .
and on the second day ye shall offer twelve young bul@@ locks , two r@@ ams , fourteen lam@@ bs of the first year without spot :
and one goat for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , and his meat offering , and his drink offering .
their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bul@@ locks , for the r@@ ams , and for the lam@@ bs , shall be according to their number , after the manner :
and one kid of the goats for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , his meat offering , and his drink offering .
and one goat for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , and his meat offering , and his drink offering .
and one goat for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , and his meat offering , and his drink offering .
these things ye shall do unto the LORD in your set fe@@ asts , beside your v@@ ows , and your fre@@ e@@ will offerings , for your burnt offerings , and for your meat offerings , and for your drink offerings , and for your peace offerings .
and Moses sp@@ ake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel , saying , This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded .
and Moses sp@@ ake unto the people , saying , Ar@@ m some of yourselves unto the war , and let them go against the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites , and av@@ enge the LORD of Mi@@ dian .
so there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel , a thousand of every tribe , twelve thousand armed for war .
and Moses sent them to the war , a thousand of every tribe , them and Ph@@ ine@@ has the son of Ele@@ az@@ ar the priest , to the war , with the holy instruments , and the trum@@ pets to blow in his hand .
and the children of Israel took all the women of Mi@@ dian cap@@ tives , and their little ones , and took the spoil of all their cattle , and all their f@@ locks , and all their goods .
and they brought the cap@@ tives , and the prey , and the spoil , unto Moses , and Ele@@ az@@ ar the priest , and unto the congregation of the children of Israel , unto the camp at the plains of Mo@@ ab , which are by Jordan near Jer@@ ich@@ o .
behold , these caused the children of Israel , through the counsel of Bal@@ a@@ am , to commit t@@ resp@@ ass against the LORD in the matter of Pe@@ or , and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD .
and do ye abide without the camp seven days : wh@@ oso@@ ever hath killed any person , and wh@@ oso@@ ever hath touched any sl@@ ain , puri@@ fy both yourselves and your cap@@ tives on the third day , and on the seventh day .
and puri@@ fy all your ra@@ iment , and all that is made of skins , and all work of goats ' hair , and all things made of wood .
and lev@@ y a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went out to battle : one soul of five hundred , both of the persons , and of the be@@ eves , and of the asses , and of the sheep :
and the boo@@ ty , being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught , was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep ,
and the be@@ eves were thirty and six thousand ; of which the LORD 's tribute was thre@@ es@@ core and twelve .
and the persons were sixteen thousand ; of which the LORD 's tribute was thirty and two persons .
we have therefore brought an ob@@ lation for the LORD , what every man hath gotten , of jew@@ els of gold , chains , and brac@@ elets , rings , ear@@ rings , and tablets , to make an at@@ onement for our souls before the LORD .
W@@ herefore , said they , if we have found grace in thy sight , let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession , and bring us not over Jordan .
and Moses said unto the children of G@@ ad and to the children of Re@@ ub@@ en , Sh@@ all your brethren go to war , and shall ye sit here ?
and where@@ fore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them ?
for when they went up unto the valley of E@@ sh@@ col , and saw the land , they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel , that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them .
and the LORD 's anger was kind@@ led against Israel , and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years , until all the generation , that had done evil in the sight of the LORD , was consumed .
for if ye turn away from after him , he will yet again leave them in the wilderness ; and ye shall destroy all this people .
but we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel , until we have brought them unto their place : and our little ones shall dwell in the f@@ enced cities because of the inhabitants of the land .
and Moses said unto them , If ye will do this thing , if ye will go armed before the LORD to war ,
and the land be subdued before the LORD : then afterward ye shall return , and be guil@@ tless before the LORD , and before Israel ; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD .
build you cities for your little ones , and fol@@ ds for your sheep ; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth .
and the children of G@@ ad and the children of Re@@ ub@@ en sp@@ ake unto Moses , saying , Th@@ y servants will do as my lord comman@@ det@@ h .
our little ones , our wives , our f@@ locks , and all our cattle , shall be there in the cities of Gil@@ e@@ ad :
and Moses said unto them , If the children of G@@ ad and the children of Re@@ ub@@ en will pass with you over Jordan , every man armed to battle , before the LORD , and the land shall be subdued before you ; then ye shall give them the land of Gil@@ e@@ ad for a possession :
and the children of G@@ ad and the children of Re@@ ub@@ en answered , saying , As the LORD hath said unto thy servants , so will we do .
we will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Can@@ a@@ an , that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours .
and Ne@@ bo , and Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ me@@ on , ( their names being changed , ) and S@@ hib@@ ma@@ h : and gave other names unto the cities which they buil@@ ded .
these are the journeys of the children of Israel , which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron .
and Moses wrote their go@@ ings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the LORD : and these are their journeys according to their go@@ ings out .
and they removed from Mar@@ ah , and came unto Eli@@ m : and in Eli@@ m were twelve foun@@ tains of water , and thre@@ es@@ core and ten palm trees ; and they pit@@ ched there .
and they removed from Kad@@ esh , and pit@@ ched in mount H@@ or , in the edge of the land of E@@ dom .
and Aaron the priest went up into mount H@@ or at the commandment of the LORD , and died there , in the forti@@ eth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt , in the first day of the fifth month .
and king Ara@@ d the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite , which d@@ wel@@ t in the south in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , heard of the coming of the children of Israel .
and ye shall dis@@ possess the inhabitants of the land , and dwell therein : for I have given you the land to possess it .
command the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye come into the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; ( this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance , even the land of Can@@ a@@ an with the co@@ asts thereof : )
then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Z@@ in along by the coast of E@@ dom , and your south border shall be the out@@ most coast of the salt sea eastward :
and your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Ak@@ rab@@ bi@@ m , and pass on to Z@@ in : and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kad@@ esh @@@ -@@ @ bar@@ ne@@ a , and shall go on to Haz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ add@@ ar , and pass on to Az@@ mon :
and as for the western border , ye shall even have the great sea for a border : this shall be your west border .
and the border shall go on to Zi@@ ph@@ ron , and the go@@ ings out of it shall be at Haz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ en@@ an : this shall be your north border .
and the border shall go down to Jordan , and the go@@ ings out of it shall be at the salt sea : this shall be your land with the co@@ asts thereof round about .
and Moses commanded the children of Israel , saying , This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot , which the LORD commanded to give unto the nine tribes , and to the half tribe :
these are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you : Ele@@ az@@ ar the priest , and Joshua the son of N@@ un .
and the names of the men are these : of the tribe of Jud@@ ah , Cal@@ eb the son of J@@ ep@@ hun@@ ne@@ h .
and the cities shall they have to dwell in ; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle , and for their goods , and for all their beasts .
and the suburbs of the cities , which ye shall give unto the Lev@@ ites , shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cub@@ its round about .
so all the cities which ye shall give to the Lev@@ ites shall be forty and eight cities : them shall ye give with their suburbs .
speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Can@@ a@@ an ;
ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan , and three cities shall ye give in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which shall be cities of refuge .
these six cities shall be a refuge , both for the children of Israel , and for the stranger , and for the so@@ jour@@ ner among them : that every one that kill@@ eth any person un@@ awa@@ res may flee thi@@ ther .
and if he sm@@ ite him with an instrument of iron , so that he die , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
or if he sm@@ ite him with an hand weapon of wood , where@@ with he may die , and he die , he is a murderer : the murderer shall surely be put to death .
or in enmity sm@@ ite him with his hand , that he die : he that smo@@ te him shall surely be put to death ; for he is a murderer : the rev@@ enger of blood shall sl@@ ay the murderer , when he me@@ et@@ eth him .
and the congregation shall deliver the s@@ layer out of the hand of the rev@@ enger of blood , and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge , whi@@ ther he was fled : and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest , which was ano@@ inted with the holy oil .
and the rev@@ enger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge , and the rev@@ enger of blood kill the s@@ layer ; he shall not be guilty of blood :
because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the s@@ layer shall return into the land of his possession .
wh@@ os@@ o kill@@ eth any person , the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses : but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die .
so ye shall not poll@@ ute the land where@@ in ye are : for blood it de@@ fil@@ eth the land : and the land C@@ AN@@ NOT be cleans@@ ed of the blood that is shed therein , but by the blood of him that shed it .
and they said , The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had our brother unto his daughters .
and when the jub@@ ile of the children of Israel shall be , then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe where@@ unto they are received : so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers .
and Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD , saying , The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well .
this is the thing which the LORD do@@ th command concerning the daughters of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had , saying , Let them marry to whom they think best ; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry .
so shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe : for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe ; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance .
for Mah@@ l@@ al , Tir@@ z@@ ah , and H@@ og@@ lah , and Mil@@ ca@@ h , and Noah , the daughters of Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had , were married unto their father 's brothers ' sons :
and they were married into the families of the sons of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h the son of Joseph , and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father .
these are the commandments and the judgments , which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Mo@@ ab by Jordan near Jer@@ ich@@ o .
these be the words which Moses sp@@ ake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness , in the plain over against the Red sea , between Par@@ an , and T@@ oph@@ el , and Lab@@ an , and Haz@@ ero@@ th , and D@@ iz@@ a@@ hab .
behold , I have set the land before you : go in and possess the land which the LORD sw@@ are unto your fathers , Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , to give unto them and to their seed after them .
and I sp@@ ake unto you at that time , saying , I am not able to bear you myself alone :
so I took the chief of your tribes , wise men , and known , and made them heads over you , cap@@ tains over thousands , and cap@@ tains over hundreds , and cap@@ tains over fif@@ ties , and cap@@ tains over tens , and officers among your tribes .
and I charged your judges at that time , saying , He@@ ar the causes between your brethren , and judge righte@@ ously between every man and his brother , and the stranger that is with him .
and when we departed from H@@ ore@@ b , we went through all that great and terrible wilderness , which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the A@@ mor@@ ites , as the LORD our God commanded us ; and we came to Kad@@ esh @@@ -@@ @ bar@@ ne@@ a .
and I said unto you , Y@@ e are come unto the mountain of the A@@ mor@@ ites , which the LORD our God do@@ th give unto us .
and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down unto us , and brought us word again , and said , It is a good land which the LORD our God do@@ th give us .
and ye mur@@ mu@@ red in your tents , and said , Because the LORD hated us , he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt , to deliver us into the hand of the A@@ mor@@ ites , to destroy us .
whi@@ ther shall we go up ? our brethren have discouraged our heart , saying , The people is greater and taller than we ; the cities are great and w@@ alled up to heaven ; and moreover we have seen the sons of the An@@ ak@@ ims there .
who went in the way before you , to search you out a place to pitch your tents in , in fire by night , to sh@@ ew you by what way ye should go , and in a cloud by day .
but Joshua the son of N@@ un , which stand@@ eth before thee , he shall go in thi@@ ther : encourage him : for he shall cause Israel to inherit it .
so I sp@@ ake unto you ; and ye would not hear , but reb@@ elled against the commandment of the LORD , and went presu@@ mp@@ tu@@ ously up into the hill .
and ye returned and we@@ pt before the LORD ; but the LORD would not hear@@ ken to your voice , nor give ear unto you .
then we turned , and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea , as the LORD sp@@ ake unto me : and we comp@@ assed mount Se@@ ir many days .
med@@ dle not with them ; for I will not give you of their land , no , not so much as a foot breadth ; because I have given mount Se@@ ir unto Es@@ au for a possession .
and when we passed by from our brethren the children of Es@@ au , which d@@ wel@@ t in Se@@ ir , through the way of the plain from El@@ ath , and from E@@ z@@ ion @@@ -@@ @ gab@@ er , we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Mo@@ ab .
the Em@@ ims d@@ wel@@ t therein in times past , a people great , and many , and tall , as the An@@ ak@@ ims ;
the Hor@@ ims also d@@ wel@@ t in Se@@ ir be@@ fore@@ time ; but the children of Es@@ au succeeded them , when they had destroyed them from before them , and d@@ wel@@ t in their stead ; as Israel did unto the land of his possession , which the LORD gave unto them .
( that also was accounted a land of giants : giants d@@ wel@@ t therein in old time ; and the Am@@ mon@@ ites call them Z@@ am@@ z@@ um@@ mim@@ s ;
and the Avi@@ ms which d@@ wel@@ t in Haz@@ eri@@ m , even unto A@@ zz@@ ah , the Cap@@ h@@ tor@@ ims , which came forth out of Cap@@ h@@ tor , destroyed them , and d@@ wel@@ t in their stead . )
rise ye up , take your journey , and pass over the river Ar@@ non : behold , I have given into th@@ ine hand Si@@ hon the A@@ mor@@ ite , king of H@@ esh@@ bon , and his land : begin to possess it , and contend with him in battle .
and we took all his cities at that time , and utterly destroyed the men , and the women , and the little ones , of every city , we left none to remain :
only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves , and the spoil of the cities which we took .
from A@@ ro@@ er , which is by the brink of the river of Ar@@ non , and from the city that is by the river , even unto Gil@@ e@@ ad , there was not one city too strong for us : the LORD our God delivered all unto us :
and we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the A@@ mor@@ ites the land that was on this side Jordan , from the river of Ar@@ non unto mount Her@@ mon ;
all the cities of the plain , and all Gil@@ e@@ ad , and all Bash@@ an , unto Sal@@ cha@@ h and E@@ dre@@ i , cities of the kingdom of O@@ g in Bash@@ an .
for only O@@ g king of Bash@@ an remained of the remn@@ ant of giants ; behold , his bed@@ stead was a bed@@ stead of iron ; is it not in Rab@@ bath of the children of Am@@ mon ? nine cub@@ its was the length thereof , and four cub@@ its the breadth of it , after the cub@@ it of a man .
and this land , which we possessed at that time , from A@@ ro@@ er , which is by the river Ar@@ non , and half mount Gil@@ e@@ ad , and the cities thereof , gave I unto the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites and to the G@@ ad@@ ites .
J@@ air the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h took all the country of Ar@@ go@@ b unto the co@@ asts of G@@ es@@ hur@@ i and Ma@@ acha@@ th@@ i ; and called them after his own name , Bash@@ an @@@ -@@ @ ha@@ vo@@ th @@@ -@@ @ J@@ air , unto this day .
the plain also , and Jordan , and the coast thereof , from Chin@@ ner@@ eth even unto the sea of the plain , even the salt sea , under Ash@@ do@@ th @@@ -@@ @ p@@ is@@ g@@ ah eastward .
I pray thee , let me go over , and see the good land that is beyond Jordan , that goo@@ dly mountain , and Lebanon .
but the LORD was w@@ ro@@ th with me for your s@@ akes , and would not hear me : and the LORD said unto me , Let it suffice thee ; speak no more unto me of this matter .
get thee up into the top of Pis@@ g@@ ah , and lift up th@@ ine eyes w@@ est@@ ward , and nor@@ th@@ ward , and sou@@ th@@ ward , and eastward , and behold it with th@@ ine eyes : for thou shalt not go over this Jordan .
now therefore hear@@ ken , O Israel , unto the statutes and unto the judgments , which I teach you , for to do them , that ye may live , and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers gi@@ v@@ eth you .
ye shall not add unto the word which I command you , neither shall ye diminish ought from it , that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you .
and ye came near and stood under the mountain ; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven , with darkness , clouds , and thick darkness .
and the LORD sp@@ ake unto you out of the midst of the fire : ye heard the voice of the words , but saw no simil@@ itude ; only ye heard a voice .
and he declared unto you his covenant , which he commanded you to perform , even ten commandments ; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone .
take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves ; for ye saw no manner of simil@@ itude on the day that the LORD sp@@ ake unto you in H@@ ore@@ b out of the midst of the fire :
but the LORD hath taken you , and brought you forth out of the iron furnace , even out of Egypt , to be unto him a people of inheritance , as ye are this day .
furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your s@@ akes , and sw@@ are that I should not go over Jordan , and that I should not go in unto that good land , which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee for an inheritance :
but I must die in this land , I must not go over Jordan : but ye shall go over , and possess that good land .
take heed unto yourselves , lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God , which he made with you , and make you a gra@@ ven image , or the lik@@ eness of any thing , which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee .
and the LORD shall sc@@ atter you among the nations , and ye shall be left few in number among the he@@ a@@ then , whi@@ ther the LORD shall lead you .
when thou art in tribu@@ lation , and all these things are come upon thee , even in the latter days , if thou turn to the LORD thy God , and shalt be obedient unto his voice ;
out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice , that he might instruct thee : and upon earth he sh@@ ew@@ ed thee his great fire ; and thou hear@@ dest his words out of the midst of the fire .
know therefore this day , and consider it in th@@ ine heart , that the LORD he is God in heaven above , and upon the earth beneath : there is none else .
thou shalt keep therefore his statutes , and his commandments , which I command thee this day , that it may go well with thee , and with thy children after thee , and that thou may@@ est prolong thy days upon the earth , which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee , for ever .
namely , B@@ ez@@ er in the wilderness , in the plain country , of the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites ; and Ram@@ o@@ th in Gil@@ e@@ ad , of the G@@ ad@@ ites ; and Golan in Bash@@ an , of the Man@@ ass@@ ites .
on this side Jordan , in the valley over against B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ pe@@ or , in the land of Si@@ hon king of the A@@ mor@@ ites , who d@@ wel@@ t at H@@ esh@@ bon , whom Moses and the children of Israel smo@@ te , after they were come forth out of Egypt :
and they possessed his land , and the land of O@@ g king of Bash@@ an , two kings of the A@@ mor@@ ites , which were on this side Jordan toward the sun@@ rising ;
and all the plain on this side Jordan eastward , even unto the sea of the plain , under the springs of Pis@@ g@@ ah .
and Moses called all Israel , and said unto them , He@@ ar , O Israel , the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day , that ye may learn them , and keep , and do them .
the LORD made not this covenant with our fathers , but with us , even us , who are all of us here alive this day .
the LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire ,
( I stood between the LORD and you at that time , to sh@@ ew you the work of the LORD : for ye were afraid by reason of the fire , and went not up into the mount ; ) saying ,
thou shalt not bow down thy@@ self unto them , nor serve them : for I the LORD thy God am a jeal@@ ous God , visiting the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me ,
and remember that thou w@@ ast a servant in the land of Egypt , and that the LORD thy God brought thee out th@@ ence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm : therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sab@@ bath day .
now therefore why should we die ? for this great fire will consume us : if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more , then we shall die .
for who is there of all flesh , that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire , as we have , and lived ?
and the LORD heard the voice of your words , when ye sp@@ ake unto me ; and the LORD said unto me , I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they have spoken unto thee : they have well said all that they have spoken .
O that there were such an heart in them , that they would fear me , and keep all my commandments always , that it might be well with them , and with their children for ever !
but as for thee , stand thou here by me , and I will speak unto thee all the commandments , and the statutes , and the judgments , which thou shalt teach them , that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it .
ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you : ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left .
ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you , that ye may live , and that it may be well with you , and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess .
that thou mi@@ gh@@ test fear the LORD thy God , to keep all his statutes and his commandments , which I command thee , thou , and thy son , and thy son 's son , all the days of thy life ; and that thy days may be prolonged .
hear therefore , O Israel , and observe to do it ; that it may be well with thee , and that ye may increase mi@@ gh@@ tily , as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee , in the land that flow@@ eth with milk and honey .
and thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all th@@ ine heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy might .
and it shall be , when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sw@@ are unto thy fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , to give thee great and goo@@ dly cities , which thou buil@@ ded@@ st not ,
ye shall dilig@@ ently keep the commandments of the LORD your God , and his testim@@ onies , and his statutes , which he hath commanded thee .
and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD : that it may be well with thee , and that thou may@@ est go in and possess the good land which the LORD sw@@ are unto thy fathers ,
and the LORD sh@@ ew@@ ed signs and wonders , great and sore , upon Egypt , upon Phar@@ aoh , and upon all his household , before our eyes :
and he brought us out from th@@ ence , that he might bring us in , to give us the land which he sw@@ are unto our fathers .
and when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee ; thou shalt sm@@ ite them , and utterly destroy them ; thou shalt make no covenant with them , nor sh@@ ew mercy unto them :
for they will turn away thy son from following me , that they may serve other gods : so will the anger of the LORD be kind@@ led against you , and destroy thee suddenly .
but thus shall ye deal with them ; ye shall destroy their al@@ t@@ ars , and break down their images , and cut down their gro@@ ves , and burn their gra@@ ven images with fire .
for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God : the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself , above all people that are upon the face of the earth .
the LORD did not set his love upon you , nor choose you , because ye were more in number than any people ; for ye were the fe@@ west of all people :
but because the LORD loved you , and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers , hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand , and re@@ deemed you out of the house of bond@@ men , from the hand of Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt .
W@@ herefore it shall come to pass , if ye hear@@ ken to these judgments , and keep , and do them , that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sw@@ are unto thy fathers :
and the LORD will take away from thee all sickness , and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt , which thou know@@ est , upon thee ; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee .
and thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee ; th@@ ine eye shall have no pity upon them : neither shalt thou serve their gods ; for that will be a sn@@ are unto thee .
thou shalt not be afraid of them : but shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Phar@@ aoh , and unto all Egypt ;
moreover the LORD thy God will send the hor@@ net among them , until they that are left , and hide themselves from thee , be destroyed .
and he shall deliver their kings into th@@ ine hand , and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven : there shall no man be able to stand before thee , until thou have destroyed them .
the gra@@ ven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire : thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them , nor take it unto thee , lest thou be sn@@ ared therein : for it is an ab@@ om@@ ination to the LORD thy God .
who fed thee in the wilderness with man@@ na , which thy fathers knew not , that he might humble thee , and that he might prove thee , to do thee good at thy latter end ;
but thou shalt remember the LORD thy God : for it is he that gi@@ v@@ eth thee power to get wealth , that he may establish his covenant which he sw@@ are unto thy fathers , as it is this day .
and it shall be , if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God , and walk after other gods , and serve them , and worship them , I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish .
a people great and tall , the children of the An@@ ak@@ ims , whom thou know@@ est , and of whom thou hast heard say , Who can stand before the children of An@@ ak !
understand therefore this day , that the LORD thy God is he which go@@ eth over before thee ; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them , and he shall bring them down before thy face : so shalt thou drive them out , and destroy them quickly , as the LORD hath said unto thee .
remember , and forget not , how thou provo@@ k@@ ed@@ st the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness : from the day that thou did@@ st depart out of the land of Egypt , until ye came unto this place , ye have been rebelli@@ ous against the LORD .
when I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone , even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you , then I ab@@ ode in the mount forty days and forty nights , I neither did eat bread nor drink water :
and the LORD said unto me , A@@ rise , get thee down quickly from hence ; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves ; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them ; they have made them a mol@@ ten image .
so I turned and came down from the mount , and the mount burned with fire : and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands .
and I fell down before the LORD , as at the first , forty days and forty nights : I did neither eat bread , nor drink water , because of all your sins which ye sin@@ ned , in doing w@@ ick@@ edly in the sight of the LORD , to provoke him to anger .
for I was afraid of the anger and hot dis@@ pleasure , where@@ with the LORD was w@@ ro@@ th against you to destroy you . but the LORD hear@@ k@@ ened unto me at that time also .
and at Tab@@ er@@ ah , and at Mass@@ ah , and at Ki@@ bro@@ th @@@ -@@ @ h@@ att@@ a@@ av@@ ah , ye provoked the LORD to wrath .
thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights , as I fell down at the first ; because the LORD had said he would destroy you .
I prayed therefore unto the LORD , and said , O Lord GO@@ D , destroy not thy people and th@@ ine inheritance , which thou hast re@@ deemed through thy greatness , which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand .
at that time the LORD said unto me , H@@ ew thee two tables of stone like unto the first , and come up unto me into the mount , and make thee an ark of wood .
and he wrote on the tables , according to the first writing , the ten commandments , which the LORD sp@@ ake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly : and the LORD gave them unto me .
and the children of Israel took their journey from Be@@ ero@@ th of the children of Ja@@ ak@@ an to Mos@@ era : there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Ele@@ az@@ ar his son minist@@ ered in the priest 's office in his stead .
at that time the LORD separated the tribe of Lev@@ i , to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD , to stand before the LORD to minister unto him , and to bless in his name , unto this day .
and the LORD said unto me , A@@ rise , take thy journey before the people , that they may go in and possess the land , which I sw@@ are unto their fathers to give unto them .
only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them , and he chose their seed after them , even you above all people , as it is this day .
thou shalt fear the LORD thy God ; him shalt thou serve , and to him shalt thou cle@@ ave , and swear by his name .
thy fathers went down into Egypt with thre@@ es@@ core and ten persons ; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude .
and know ye this day : for I speak not with your children which have not known , and which have not seen the ch@@ as@@ tis@@ ement of the LORD your God , his greatness , his mighty hand , and his stretched out arm ,
and his miracles , and his acts , which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Phar@@ aoh the king of Egypt , and unto all his land ;
therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day , that ye may be strong , and go in and possess the land , whi@@ ther ye go to possess it ;
a land which the LORD thy God care@@ th for : the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it , from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year .
and it shall come to pass , if ye shall hear@@ ken dilig@@ ently unto my commandments which I command you this day , to love the LORD your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul ,
and then the LORD 's wrath be kind@@ led against you , and he shut up the heaven , that there be no rain , and that the land yield not her fruit ; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD gi@@ v@@ eth you .
and ye shall teach them your children , speaking of them when thou sit@@ test in th@@ ine house , and when thou walk@@ est by the way , when thou li@@ est down , and when thou ris@@ est up .
and thou shalt write them upon the door posts of th@@ ine house , and upon thy gates :
that your days may be multiplied , and the days of your children , in the land which the LORD sw@@ are unto your fathers to give them , as the days of heaven upon the earth .
for if ye shall dilig@@ ently keep all these commandments which I command you , to do them , to love the LORD your God , to walk in all his ways , and to cle@@ ave unto him ;
every place where@@ on the sol@@ es of your feet shall t@@ read shall be yours : from the wilderness and Lebanon , from the river , the river E@@ uph@@ rates , even unto the utter@@ most sea shall your coast be .
there shall no man be able to stand before you : for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dre@@ ad of you upon all the land that ye shall t@@ read upon , as he hath said unto you .
and a curse , if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other gods , which ye have not known .
and it shall come to pass , when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whi@@ ther thou go@@ est to possess it , that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Ger@@ iz@@ im , and the curse upon mount E@@ bal .
ye shall utterly destroy all the places , where@@ in the nations which ye shall possess served their gods , upon the high mountains , and upon the hills , and under every green tree :
and ye shall overthrow their al@@ t@@ ars , and break their pillars , and burn their gro@@ ves with fire ; and ye shall he@@ w down the gra@@ ven images of their gods , and destroy the names of them out of that place .
but unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there , even unto his hab@@ itation shall ye seek , and thi@@ ther thou shalt come :
and thi@@ ther ye shall bring your burnt offerings , and your sacrifices , and your ti@@ thes , and he@@ ave offerings of your hand , and your v@@ ows , and your fre@@ e@@ will offerings , and the fir@@ st@@ lings of your herds and of your f@@ locks :
and there ye shall eat before the LORD your God , and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto , ye and your households , where@@ in the LORD thy God hath blessed thee .
ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day , every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes .
take heed to thy@@ self that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou se@@ est :
but in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes , there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings , and there thou shalt do all that I command thee .
even as the Ro@@ e@@ buck and the hart is eaten , so thou shalt eat them : the un@@ clean and the clean shall eat of them alike .
only be sure that thou eat not the blood : for the blood is the life ; and thou may@@ est not eat the life with the flesh .
and thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings , the flesh and the blood , upon the altar of the LORD thy God : and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God , and thou shalt eat the flesh .
observe and hear all these words which I command thee , that it may go well with thee , and with thy children after thee for ever , when thou do@@ est that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God .
ye shall walk after the LORD your God , and fear him , and keep his commandments , and obey his voice , and ye shall serve him , and cle@@ ave unto him .
but thou shalt surely kill him ; th@@ ine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterwards the hand of all the people .
and thou shalt stone him with stones , that he die ; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God , which brought thee out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bond@@ age .
and all Israel shall hear , and fear , and shall do no more any such w@@ ick@@ edness as this is among you .
certain men , the children of Beli@@ al , are gone out from among you , and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city , saying , Let us go and serve other gods , which ye have not known ;
and there shall cle@@ ave n@@ ought of the cur@@ sed thing to th@@ ine hand : that the LORD may turn from the fierc@@ eness of his anger , and sh@@ ew thee mercy , and have compassion upon thee , and multiply thee , as he hath sworn unto thy fathers ;
when thou shalt hear@@ ken to the voice of the LORD thy God , to keep all his commandments which I command thee this day , to do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God .
for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God , and the LORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself , above all the nations that are upon the earth .
and every beast that part@@ eth the ho@@ of , and cle@@ av@@ eth the cle@@ ft into two cl@@ aws , and chew@@ eth the cu@@ d among the beasts , that ye shall eat .
nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cu@@ d , or of them that divide the clo@@ ven ho@@ of ; as the cam@@ el , and the h@@ are , and the Con@@ ey : for they chew the cu@@ d , but divide not the ho@@ of ; therefore they are un@@ clean unto you .
then shalt thou turn it into money , and bind up the money in th@@ ine hand , and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose :
at the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the ti@@ the of th@@ ine increase the same year , and shalt lay it up within thy gates :
and this is the manner of the release : every creditor that len@@ det@@ h ought unto his neighbour shall release it ; he shall not exact it of his neighbour , or of his brother ; because it is called the LORD 's release .
but thou shalt open th@@ ine hand wide unto him , and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need , in that which he w@@ ant@@ eth .
thou shalt surely give him , and th@@ ine heart shall not be griev@@ ed when thou gi@@ v@@ est unto him : because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works , and in all that thou put@@ test th@@ ine hand unto .
for the poor shall never cease out of the land : therefore I command thee , saying , Th@@ ou shalt open th@@ ine hand wide unto thy brother , to thy poor , and to thy ne@@ edy , in thy land .
and if thy brother , an Hebrew man , or an Hebrew woman , be sold unto thee , and serve thee six years ; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee .
thou shalt fur@@ nish him liber@@ ally out of thy flock , and out of thy floor , and out of thy win@@ ep@@ ress : of that where@@ with the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him .
and thou shalt remember that thou w@@ ast a bond@@ man in the land of Egypt , and the LORD thy God re@@ deemed thee : therefore I command thee this thing to day .
then thou shalt take an aul , and thrust it through his ear unto the door , and he shall be thy servant for ever . and also unto thy mai@@ d@@ servant thou shalt do likewise .
thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose , thou and thy household .
and if there be any bl@@ emish therein , as if it be lame , or blind , or have any ill bl@@ emish , thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God .
thou shalt eat it within thy gates : the un@@ clean and the clean person shall eat it alike , as the Ro@@ e@@ buck , and as the hart .
observe the month of A@@ bi@@ b , and keep the pas@@ sover unto the LORD thy God : for in the month of A@@ bi@@ b the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night .
thou shalt therefore sacrifice the pas@@ sover unto the LORD thy God , of the flock and the herd , in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there .
but at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in , there thou shalt sacrifice the pas@@ sover at even , at the going down of the sun , at the season that thou cam@@ est forth out of Egypt .
and thou shalt ro@@ ast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose : and thou shalt turn in the morning , and go unto thy tents .
six days thou shalt eat un@@ leav@@ ened bread : and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God : thou shalt do no work therein .
seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee : begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou begin@@ nest to put the sick@@ le to the corn .
and thou shalt rejoice in thy feast , thou , and thy son , and thy daughter , and thy man@@ servant , and thy mai@@ d@@ servant , and the Lev@@ ite , the stranger , and the fa@@ ther@@ less , and the widow , that are within thy gates .
and it be told thee , and thou hast heard of it , and inqui@@ red dilig@@ ently , and , behold , it be true , and the thing certain , that such ab@@ om@@ ination is wrought in Israel :
the hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterward the hands of all the people . so thou shalt put the evil away from among you .
and thou shalt come unto the priests the Lev@@ ites , and unto the judge that shall be in those days , and inqu@@ ire ; and they shall sh@@ ew thee the sentence of judgment :
and thou shalt do according to the sentence , which they of that place which the LORD shall choose shall sh@@ ew thee ; and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee :
and the man that will do presu@@ mp@@ tu@@ ously , and will not hear@@ ken unto the priest that stand@@ eth to minister there before the LORD thy God , or unto the judge , even that man shall die : and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel .
thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee , whom the LORD thy God shall choose : one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee : thou may@@ est not set a stranger over thee , which is not thy brother .
but he shall not multiply horses to himself , nor cause the people to return to Egypt , to the end that he should multiply horses : for@@ as@@ much as the LORD hath said unto you , Y@@ e shall h@@ ence@@ forth return no more that way .
and it shall be with him , and he shall read therein all the days of his life : that he may learn to fear the LORD his God , to keep all the words of this law and these statutes , to do them :
then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God , as all his brethren the Lev@@ ites do , which stand there before the LORD .
for all that do these things are an ab@@ om@@ ination unto the LORD : and because of these ab@@ om@@ inations the LORD thy God do@@ th drive them out from before thee .
the LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee , of thy brethren , like unto me ; unto him ye shall hear@@ ken ;
according to all that thou desi@@ red@@ st of the LORD thy God in H@@ ore@@ b in the day of the assembly , saying , Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God , neither let me see this great fire any more , that I die not .
and it shall come to pass , that wh@@ oso@@ ever will not hear@@ ken unto my words which he shall speak in my name , I will require it of him .
but the prophet , which shall presume to speak a word in my name , which I have not commanded him to speak , or that shall speak in the name of other gods , even that prophet shall die .
when a prophet spe@@ ak@@ eth in the name of the LORD , if the thing follow not , nor come to pass , that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken , but the prophet hath spoken it presu@@ mp@@ tu@@ ously : thou shalt not be afraid of him .
when the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations , whose land the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee , and thou succe@@ ed@@ est them , and dwell@@ est in their cities , and in their houses ;
thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land , which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee to possess it .
thou shalt prepare thee a way , and divide the co@@ asts of thy land , which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee to inherit , into three parts , that every s@@ layer may flee thi@@ ther .
and this is the case of the s@@ layer , which shall flee thi@@ ther , that he may live : wh@@ os@@ o kill@@ eth his neighbour ignor@@ antly , whom he hated not in time past ;
if thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them , which I command thee this day , to love the LORD thy God , and to walk ever in his ways ; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee , beside these three :
but if any man hate his neighbour , and lie in wait for him , and rise up against him , and sm@@ ite him mort@@ ally that he die , and fle@@ eth into one of these cities :
then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him th@@ ence , and deliver him into the hand of the Av@@ enger of blood , that he may die .
thou shalt not remove thy neighbour 's landmark , which they of old time have set in th@@ ine inheritance , which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee to possess it .
if a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong ;
then shall ye do unto him , as he had thought to have done unto his brother : so shalt thou put the evil away from among you .
when thou go@@ est out to battle against th@@ ine enemies , and se@@ est horses , and ch@@ ari@@ ots , and a people more than thou , be not afraid of them : for the LORD thy God is with thee , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
and shall say unto them , He@@ ar , O Israel , ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies : let not your hearts faint , fear not , and do not trem@@ ble , neither be ye terrified because of them ;
for the LORD your God is he that go@@ eth with you , to fight for you agg@@ in@@ st your enemies , to save you .
and what man is he that hath planted a viney@@ ard , and hath not yet eaten of it ? let him also go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man eat of it .
and what man is there that hath bet@@ ro@@ thed a wife , and hath not taken her ? let him go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her .
and the officers shall speak further unto the people , and they shall say , What man is there that is fearful and fain@@ the@@ ar@@ ted ? let him go and return unto his house , lest his brethren 's heart faint as well as his heart .
and it shall be , if it make thee answer of peace , and open unto thee , then it shall be , that all the people that is found therein shall be tribu@@ tar@@ ies unto thee , and they shall serve thee .
and when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into th@@ ine hands , thou shalt sm@@ ite every male thereof with the edge of the sword :
thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee , which are not of the cities of these nations .
but thou shalt utterly destroy them ; namely , the Hit@@ ti@@ tes , and the A@@ mor@@ ites , the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ites , the Hi@@ v@@ ites , and the Je@@ bus@@ ites ; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee :
then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth , and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is sl@@ ain :
and the elders of that city shall bring down the hei@@ fer unto a rough valley , which is neither e@@ ared nor s@@ own , and shall strike off the hei@@ fer 's neck there in the valley :
and all the elders of that city , that are next unto the sl@@ ain man , shall wash their hands over the hei@@ fer that is be@@ headed in the valley :
be mer@@ ciful , O LORD , unto thy people Israel , whom thou hast re@@ deemed , and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel 's charge . and the blood shall be forgiven them .
if a man have two wives , one beloved , and another hated , and they have born him children , both the beloved and the hated ; and if the fir@@ st@@ born son be hers that was hated :
but he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the fir@@ st@@ born , by giving him a double portion of all that he hath : for he is the beginning of his strength ; the right of the fir@@ st@@ born is his .
if a man have a stubborn and rebelli@@ ous son , which will not obey the voice of his father , or the voice of his mother , and that , when they have cha@@ st@@ ened him , will not hear@@ ken unto them :
then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him , and bring him out unto the elders of his city , and unto the gate of his place ;
and they shall say unto the elders of his city , This our son is stubborn and rebelli@@ ous , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glut@@ ton , and a drun@@ k@@ ard .
and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones , that he die : so shalt thou put evil away from among you ; and all Israel shall hear , and fear .
and if a man have committed a sin worthy of death , and he be to be put to death , and thou hang him on a tree :
the woman shall not wear that which per@@ tain@@ eth unto a man , neither shall a man put on a woman 's garment : for all that do so are ab@@ om@@ ination unto the LORD thy God .
if a bird 's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree , or on the ground , whether they be young ones , or eggs , and the dam sitting upon the young , or upon the eggs , thou shalt not take the dam with the young :
thou shalt not sow thy viney@@ ard with divers seeds : lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast s@@ own , and the fruit of thy viney@@ ard , be de@@ filed .
and , lo , he hath given occasions of speech against her , saying , I found not thy daughter a maid ; and yet these are the tok@@ ens of my daughter 's vir@@ g@@ inity . and they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city .
but if this thing be true , and the tok@@ ens of vir@@ g@@ inity be not found for the dam@@ sel :
if a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband , then they shall both of them die , both the man that lay with the woman , and the woman : so shalt thou put away evil from Israel .
if a dam@@ sel that is a virgin be bet@@ ro@@ thed unto an husband , and a man find her in the city , and lie with her ;
but unto the dam@@ sel thou shalt do nothing ; there is in the dam@@ sel no sin worthy of death : for as when a man ris@@ eth against his neighbour , and s@@ lay@@ eth him , even so is this matter :
then the man that lay with her shall give unto the dam@@ sel 's father fifty she@@ k@@ els of silver , and she shall be his wife ; because he hath hum@@ bled her , he may not put her away all his days .
a b@@ ast@@ ard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD ; even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD .
an Am@@ mon@@ ite or Mo@@ ab@@ ite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD ; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever :
thou shalt not abh@@ or an E@@ dom@@ ite ; for he is thy brother : thou shalt not abh@@ or an Egyptian ; because thou w@@ ast a stranger in his land .
thou shalt not bring the hire of a wh@@ ore , or the price of a dog , into the house of the LORD thy God for any vo@@ w : for even both these are ab@@ om@@ ination unto the LORD thy God .
when thou com@@ est into thy neighbour 's viney@@ ard , then thou may@@ est eat grapes thy fill at th@@ ine own pleasure ; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel .
and if the latter husband hate her , and write her a bill of divor@@ cement , and gi@@ v@@ eth it in her hand , and sen@@ det@@ h her out of his house ; or if the latter husband die , which took her to be his wife ;
remember what the LORD thy God did unto Mi@@ ri@@ am by the way , after that ye were come forth out of Egypt .
in any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun go@@ eth down , that he may sleep in his own ra@@ iment , and bless thee : and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God .
thou shalt not op@@ press an hired servant that is poor and ne@@ edy , whether he be of thy brethren , or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates :
the fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin .
thou shalt not perver@@ t the judgment of the stranger , nor of the fa@@ ther@@ less ; nor take a widow 's ra@@ iment to pledge :
but thou shalt remember that thou w@@ ast a bond@@ man in Egypt , and the LORD thy God re@@ deemed thee th@@ ence : therefore I command thee to do this thing .
when thou cut@@ test down th@@ ine harvest in thy field , and hast forgot a she@@ af in the field , thou shalt not go again to fetch it : it shall be for the stranger , for the fa@@ ther@@ less , and for the widow : that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of th@@ ine hands .
when thou gather@@ est the grapes of thy viney@@ ard , thou shalt not g@@ lean it afterward : it shall be for the stranger , for the fa@@ ther@@ less , and for the widow .
if there be a controversy between men , and they come unto judgment , that the judges may judge them ; then they shall justify the righteous , and condemn the wicked .
and it shall be , that the fir@@ st@@ born which she be@@ areth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead , that his name be not put out of Israel .
then the elders of his city shall call him , and speak unto him : and if he stand to it , and say , I like not to take her ;
when men strive together one with another , and the wife of the one draw@@ eth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that sm@@ it@@ eth him , and put@@ t@@ eth forth her hand , and tak@@ eth him by the secrets :
how he met thee by the way , and smo@@ te the hind@@ most of thee , even all that were fee@@ ble behind thee , when thou w@@ ast faint and weary ; and he feared not God .
therefore it shall be , when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from all th@@ ine enemies round about , in the land which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee for an inheritance to possess it , that thou shalt b@@ lot out the rem@@ embrance of A@@ mal@@ ek from under heaven ; thou shalt not forget it .
and it shall be , when thou art come in unto the land which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee for an inheritance , and poss@@ ess@@ est it , and dwell@@ est therein ;
and thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days , and say unto him , I prof@@ ess this day unto the LORD thy God , that I am come unto the country which the LORD sw@@ are unto our fathers for to give us .
and thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God , A Syrian ready to perish was my father , and he went down into Egypt , and so@@ jour@@ ned there with a few , and became there a nation , great , mighty , and populous :
and when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers , the LORD heard our voice , and looked on our afflic@@ tion , and our labour , and our oppression :
and now , behold , I have brought the fir@@ st@@ fruits of the land , which thou , O LORD , hast given me . and thou shalt set it before the LORD thy God , and worship before the LORD thy God :
and thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy God hath given unto thee , and unto th@@ ine house , thou , and the Lev@@ ite , and the stranger that is among you .
this day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments : thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all th@@ ine heart , and with all thy soul .
thou hast av@@ ou@@ ched the LORD this day to be thy God , and to walk in his ways , and to keep his statutes , and his commandments , and his judgments , and to hear@@ ken unto his voice :
and to make thee high above all nations which he hath made , in praise , and in name , and in honour ; and that thou may@@ est be an holy people unto the LORD thy God , as he hath spoken .
and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee , that thou shalt set thee up great stones , and pl@@ ai@@ ster them with pl@@ ai@@ ster :
and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law , when thou art passed over , that thou may@@ est go in unto the land which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee , a land that flow@@ eth with milk and honey ; as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee .
thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones : and thou shalt offer burnt offerings there@@ on unto the LORD thy God :
and Moses and the priests the Lev@@ ites sp@@ ake unto all Israel , saying , Take heed , and hear@@ ken , O Israel ; this day thou art become the people of the LORD thy God .
thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God , and do his commandments and his statutes , which I command thee this day .
these shall stand upon mount Ger@@ iz@@ im to bless the people , when ye are come over Jordan ; Sim@@ eon , and Lev@@ i , and Jud@@ ah , and Is@@ sac@@ har , and Joseph , and Benjamin :
cur@@ sed be the man that mak@@ eth any gra@@ ven or mol@@ ten image , an ab@@ om@@ ination unto the LORD , the work of the hands of the cra@@ fts@@ man , and put@@ t@@ eth it in a secret place . and all the people shall answer and say , A@@ men .
cur@@ sed be he that sett@@ eth light by his father or his mother . and all the people shall say , A@@ men .
cur@@ sed be he that remo@@ v@@ eth his neighbour 's landmark . and all the people shall say , A@@ men .
cur@@ sed be he that perver@@ t@@ eth the judgment of the stranger , fa@@ ther@@ less , and widow . and all the people shall say , A@@ men .
cur@@ sed be he that li@@ eth with his sister , the daughter of his father , or the daughter of his mother . and all the people shall say , A@@ men .
and it shall come to pass , if thou shalt hear@@ ken dilig@@ ently unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day , that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth :
blessed shall be the fruit of thy body , and the fruit of thy ground , and the fruit of thy cattle , the increase of thy k@@ ine , and the f@@ locks of thy sheep .
the LORD shall cause th@@ ine enemies that rise up against thee to be sm@@ it@@ ten before thy face : they shall come out against thee one way , and flee before thee seven ways .
the LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy store@@ houses , and in all that thou sett@@ est th@@ ine hand unto ; and he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God gi@@ v@@ eth thee .
the LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself , as he hath sworn unto thee , if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God , and walk in his ways .
and the LORD shall make thee pl@@ ent@@ eous in goods , in the fruit of thy body , and in the fruit of thy cattle , and in the fruit of thy ground , in the land which the LORD sw@@ are unto thy fathers to give thee .
and thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other gods to serve them .
but it shall come to pass , if thou wil@@ t not hear@@ ken unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day ; that all these cur@@ ses shall come upon thee , and over@@ take thee :
the LORD shall cause thee to be sm@@ it@@ ten before th@@ ine enemies : thou shalt go out one way against them , and flee seven ways before them : and shalt be removed into all the king@@ doms of the earth .
thou shalt bet@@ ro@@ th a wife , and another man shall lie with her : thou shalt build an house , and thou shalt not dwell therein : thou shalt plant a viney@@ ard , and shalt not gather the grapes thereof .
th@@ ine ox shall be sl@@ ain before th@@ ine eyes , and thou shalt not eat thereof : th@@ ine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face , and shall not be restored to thee : thy sheep shall be given unto th@@ ine enemies , and thou shalt have none to rescue them .
thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people , and th@@ ine eyes shall look , and fail with longing for them all the day long : and there shall be no might in th@@ ine hand .
the LORD shall sm@@ ite thee in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore bot@@ ch that C@@ AN@@ NOT be healed , from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head .
and thou shalt become an aston@@ ishment , a prover@@ b , and a by@@ word , among all nations whi@@ ther the LORD shall lead thee .
thou shalt carry much seed out into the field , and shalt gather but little in ; for the loc@@ ust shall consume it .
thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy co@@ asts , but thou shalt not ano@@ int thy@@ self with the oil ; for th@@ ine olive shall cast his fruit .
therefore shalt thou serve th@@ ine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee , in hunger , and in thirst , and in n@@ ak@@ edness , and in want of all things : and he shall put a y@@ oke of iron upon thy neck , until he have destroyed thee .
and thou shalt eat the fruit of th@@ ine own body , the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters , which the LORD thy God hath given thee , in the siege , and in the stra@@ it@@ ness , where@@ with th@@ ine enemies shall distress thee :
so that the man that is tender among you , and very delicate , his eye shall be evil toward his brother , and toward the wife of his bos@@ om , and toward the remn@@ ant of his children which he shall leave :
so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat : because he hath nothing left him in the siege , and in the stra@@ it@@ ness , where@@ with th@@ ine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates .
if thou wil@@ t not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book , that thou may@@ est fear this glorious and fearful name , THE LORD TH@@ Y GO@@ D ;
moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt , which thou w@@ ast afraid of ; and they shall cle@@ ave unto thee .
also every sickness , and every plague , which is not written in the book of this law , them will the LORD bring upon thee , until thou be destroyed .
and ye shall be left few in number , whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude ; because thou w@@ oul@@ dest not obey the voice of the LORD thy God .
and the LORD shall sc@@ atter thee among all people , from the one end of the earth even unto the other ; and there thou shalt serve other gods , which neither thou nor thy fathers have known , even wood and stone .
and among these nations shalt thou find no ease , neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest : but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and sorrow of mind :
these are the words of the covenant , which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Mo@@ ab , beside the covenant which he made with them in H@@ ore@@ b .
and Moses called unto all Israel , and said unto them , Y@@ e have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Phar@@ aoh , and unto all his servants , and unto all his land ;
and I have led you forty years in the wilderness : your clothes are not wa@@ x@@ en old upon you , and thy shoe is not wa@@ x@@ en old upon thy foot .
ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God ; your cap@@ tains of your tribes , your elders , and your officers , with all the men of Israel ,
your little ones , your wives , and thy stranger that is in thy camp , from the he@@ wer of thy wood unto the draw@@ er of thy water :
and the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel , according to all the cur@@ ses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law :
then men shall say , Because they have for@@ s@@ aken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt :
and the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation , and cast them into another land , as it is this day .
and it shall come to pass , when all these things are come upon thee , the blessing and the curse , which I have set before thee , and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations , whi@@ ther the LORD thy God hath driven thee ,
and shalt return unto the LORD thy God , and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day , thou and thy children , with all th@@ ine heart , and with all thy soul ;
that then the LORD thy God will turn thy cap@@ tivity , and have compassion upon thee , and will return and gather thee from all the nations , whi@@ ther the LORD thy God hath scattered thee .
if any of th@@ ine be driven out unto the out@@ most parts of heaven , from th@@ ence will the LORD thy God gather thee , and from th@@ ence will he fetch thee :
and the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed , and thou shalt possess it ; and he will do thee good , and multiply thee above thy fathers .
and the LORD thy God will circum@@ c@@ ise th@@ ine heart , and the heart of thy seed , to love the LORD thy God with all th@@ ine heart , and with all thy soul , that thou may@@ est live .
and the LORD thy God will put all these cur@@ ses upon th@@ ine enemies , and on them that hate thee , which persecuted thee .
if thou shalt hear@@ ken unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law , and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all th@@ ine heart , and with all thy soul .
I call heaven and earth to record this day against you , that I have set before you life and death , blessing and cur@@ sing : therefore choose life , that both thou and thy seed may live :
and he said unto them , I am an hundred and twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : also the LORD hath said unto me , Th@@ ou shalt not go over this Jordan .
and the LORD shall give them up before your face , that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you .
be strong and of a good courage , fear not , nor be afraid of them : for the LORD thy God , he it is that do@@ th go with thee ; he will not fail thee , nor for@@ sake thee .
and the LORD , he it is that do@@ th go before thee ; he will be with thee , he will not fail thee , neither for@@ sake thee : fear not , neither be dis@@ may@@ ed .
and Moses wrote this law , and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Lev@@ i , which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD , and unto all the elders of Israel .
and Moses commanded them , saying , At the end of every seven years , in the solem@@ nity of the year of release , in the feast of tab@@ ern@@ acles ,
when all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose , thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing .
gather the people together , men , and women , and children , and thy stranger that is within thy gates , that they may hear , and that they may learn , and fear the LORD your God , and observe to do all the words of this law :
and the LORD said unto Moses , Be@@ hold , thy days approach that thou must die : call Joshua , and present yourselves in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , that I may give him a charge . and Moses and Joshua went , and presented themselves in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation .
now therefore write ye this song for you , and teach it the children of Israel : put it in their mouths , that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel .
for I know thy rebellion , and thy stiff neck : behold , while I am yet alive with you this day , ye have been rebelli@@ ous against the LORD ; and how much more after my death ?
gather unto me all the elders of your tribes , and your officers , that I may speak these words in their ears , and call heaven and earth to record against them .
give ear , O ye heavens , and I will speak ; and hear , O earth , the words of my mouth .
my doctrine shall drop as the rain , my speech shall dis@@ til as the de@@ w , as the small rain upon the tender her@@ b , and as the showers upon the grass :
do ye thus requ@@ ite the LORD , O foolish people and un@@ wise ? is not he thy father that hath bought thee ? hath he not made thee , and established thee ?
he found him in a desert land , and in the waste how@@ ling wilderness ; he led him about , he instructed him , he kept him as the apple of his eye .
but Jes@@ hur@@ un wa@@ xed fat , and kicked : thou art wa@@ x@@ en fat , thou art grown thick , thou art covered with fat@@ ness ; then he for@@ s@@ ook God which made him , and lightly este@@ em@@ ed the Rock of his salvation .
and he said , I will hide my face from them , I will see what their end shall be : for they are a very fro@@ ward generation , children in whom is no faith .
were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy , lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely , and lest they should say , Our hand is high , and the LORD hath not done all this .
for their vine is of the vine of So@@ dom , and of the fields of Gom@@ or@@ rah : their grapes are grapes of g@@ all , their clusters are bitter :
which did eat the fat of their sacrifices , and drank the wine of their drink offerings ? let them rise up and help you , and be your protection .
see now that I , even I , am he , and there is no god with me : I kill , and I make alive ; I wound , and I heal : neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand .
if I wh@@ et my glit@@ tering sword , and mine hand take hold on judgment ; I will render vengeance to mine enemies , and will reward them that hate me .
rejoice , O ye nations , with his people : for he will av@@ enge the blood of his servants , and will render vengeance to his adversaries , and will be mer@@ ciful unto his land , and to his people .
and Moses came and sp@@ ake all the words of this song in the ears of the people , he , and Hos@@ he@@ a the son of N@@ un .
and he said unto them , Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day , which ye shall command your children to observe to do , all the words of this law .
get thee up into this mountain Ab@@ ari@@ m , unto mount Ne@@ bo , which is in the land of Mo@@ ab , that is over against Jer@@ ich@@ o ; and behold the land of Can@@ a@@ an , which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession :
yet thou shalt see the land before thee ; but thou shalt not go thi@@ ther unto the land which I give the children of Israel .
ye@@ a , he loved the people ; all his saints are in thy hand : and they sat down at thy feet ; every one shall receive of thy words .
and he was king in Jes@@ hur@@ un , when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together .
and this is the blessing of Jud@@ ah : and he said , He@@ ar , LORD , the voice of Jud@@ ah , and bring him unto his people : let his hands be sufficient for him ; and be thou an help to him from his enemies .
and of Lev@@ i he said , Let thy T@@ hum@@ mi@@ m and thy Uri@@ m be with thy holy one , whom thou did@@ st prove at Mass@@ ah , and with whom thou did@@ st strive at the waters of M@@ eri@@ ba@@ h ;
they shall teach Jacob thy judgments , and Israel thy law : they shall put inc@@ ense before thee , and whole burnt sacrifice upon th@@ ine altar .
bless , LORD , his substance , and accept the work of his hands : sm@@ ite through the lo@@ ins of them that rise against him , and of them that hate him , that they rise not again .
and of Dan he said , Dan is a lion 's whel@@ p : he shall leap from Bash@@ an .
and of Ash@@ er he said , Let Ash@@ er be blessed with children ; let him be acceptable to his brethren , and let him dip his foot in oil .
there is none like unto the God of Jes@@ hur@@ un , who ri@@ det@@ h upon the heaven in thy help , and in his excell@@ ency on the sky .
Israel then shall dwell in safety alone : the fountain of Jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine ; also his heavens shall drop down de@@ w .
happy art thou , O Israel : who is like unto thee , O people saved by the LORD , the shield of thy help , and who is the sword of thy excell@@ ency ! and th@@ ine enemies shall be found li@@ ars unto thee ; and thou shalt t@@ read upon their high places .
and the LORD said unto him , This is the land which I sw@@ are unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob , saying , I will give it unto thy seed : I have caused thee to see it with th@@ ine eyes , but thou shalt not go over thi@@ ther .
and the children of Israel we@@ pt for Moses in the plains of Mo@@ ab thirty days : so the days of we@@ eping and mourning for Moses were ended .
and Joshua the son of N@@ un was full of the spirit of wisdom ; for Moses had laid his hands upon him : and the children of Israel hear@@ k@@ ened unto him , and did as the LORD commanded Moses .
in all the signs and the wonders , which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Phar@@ aoh , and to all his servants , and to all his land ,
and in all that mighty hand , and in all the great terror which Moses sh@@ ew@@ ed in the sight of all Israel .
Moses my servant is dead ; now therefore arise , go over this Jordan , thou , and all this people , unto the land which I do give to them , even to the children of Israel .
every place that the sole of your foot shall t@@ read upon , that have I given unto you , as I said unto Moses .
there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life : as I was with Moses , so I will be with thee : I will not fail thee , nor for@@ sake thee .
be strong and of a good courage : for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land , which I sw@@ are unto their fathers to give them .
this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth ; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night , that thou may@@ est observe to do according to all that is written therein : for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous , and then thou shalt have good success .
have not I commanded thee ? be strong and of a good courage ; be not afraid , neither be thou dis@@ may@@ ed : for the LORD thy God is with thee whi@@ ther@@ soever thou go@@ est .
remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you , saying , The LORD your God hath given you rest , and hath given you this land .
your wives , your little ones , and your cattle , shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan ; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed , all the mighty men of val@@ our , and help them ;
wh@@ oso@@ ever he be that do@@ th rebel against thy commandment , and will not hear@@ ken unto thy words in all that thou command@@ est him , he shall be put to death : only be strong and of a good courage .
and it was told the king of Jer@@ ich@@ o , saying , Be@@ hold , there came men in hi@@ ther to night of the children of Israel to search out the country .
and the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the For@@ ds : and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out , they shut the gate .
and she said unto the men , I know that the LORD hath given you the land , and that your terror is fallen upon us , and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you .
for we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you , when ye came out of Egypt ; and what ye did unto the two kings of the A@@ mor@@ ites , that were on the other side Jordan , Si@@ hon and O@@ g , whom ye utterly destroyed .
and as soon as we had heard these things , our hearts did melt , neither did there remain any more courage in any man , because of you : for the LORD your God , he is God in heaven above , and in earth beneath .
now therefore , I pray you , swear unto me by the LORD , since I have sh@@ ew@@ ed you kindness , that ye will also sh@@ ew kindness unto my father 's house , and give me a true token :
and she said unto them , Get you to the mountain , lest the pursu@@ ers meet you ; and hide yourselves there three days , until the pursu@@ ers be returned : and afterward may ye go your way .
and they went , and came unto the mountain , and ab@@ ode there three days , until the pursu@@ ers were returned : and the pursu@@ ers sought them throughout all the way , but found them not .
and they commanded the people , saying , When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God , and the priests the Lev@@ ites bearing it , then ye shall remove from your place , and go after it .
and Joshua said unto the people , Sanc@@ ti@@ fy yourselves : for to mor@@ row the LORD will do wonders among you .
and the LORD said unto Joshua , This day will I begin to magni@@ fy thee in the sight of all Israel , that they may know that , as I was with Moses , so I will be with thee .
and thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant , saying , When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan , ye shall stand still in Jordan .
and Joshua said unto the children of Israel , Come hi@@ ther , and hear the words of the LORD your God .
and Joshua said , Her@@ e@@ by ye shall know that the living God is among you , and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the Hit@@ ti@@ tes , and the Hi@@ v@@ ites , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ites , and the Gir@@ g@@ ash@@ ites , and the A@@ mor@@ ites , and the Je@@ bus@@ ites .
now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel , out of every tribe a man .
and as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan , and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were di@@ pped in the bri@@ m of the water , ( for Jordan over@@ flow@@ eth all his banks all the time of harvest , )
then Joshua called the twelve men , whom he had prepared of the children of Israel , out of every tribe a man :
and Joshua said unto them , Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan , and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder , according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel :
and Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan , in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood : and they are there unto this day .
for the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan , until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people , according to all that Moses commanded Joshua : and the people ha@@ sted and passed over .
on that day the LORD magni@@ fied Joshua in the sight of all Israel ; and they feared him , as they feared Moses , all the days of his life .
and the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month , and enc@@ amped in Gil@@ gal , in the east border of Jer@@ ich@@ o .
and he sp@@ ake unto the children of Israel , saying , When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come , saying , What mean these stones ?
for the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you , until ye were passed over , as the LORD your God did to the Red sea , which he dried up from before us , until we were gone over :
that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD , that it is mighty : that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever .
at that time the LORD said unto Joshua , Make thee sharp kni@@ ves , and circum@@ c@@ ise again the children of Israel the second time .
and this is the cause why Joshua did circum@@ c@@ ise : all the people that came out of Egypt , that were males , even all the men of war , died in the wilderness by the way , after they came out of Egypt .
now all the people that came out were circum@@ c@@ ised : but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt , them they had not circum@@ c@@ ised .
and their children , whom he raised up in their stead , them Joshua circum@@ c@@ ised : for they were un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , because they had not circum@@ c@@ ised them by the way .
and the LORD said unto Joshua , This day have I rolled away the repro@@ ach of Egypt from off you . W@@ herefore the name of the place is called Gil@@ gal unto this day .
and the children of Israel enc@@ amped in Gil@@ gal , and kept the pas@@ sover on the four@@ teenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jer@@ ich@@ o .
and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the mor@@ row after the pas@@ sover , un@@ leav@@ ened cakes , and par@@ ched corn in the self@@ same day .
and the man@@ na ceased on the mor@@ row after they had eaten of the old corn of the land ; neither had the children of Israel man@@ na any more ; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Can@@ a@@ an that year .
and he said , N@@ ay ; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come . and Joshua fell on his face to the earth , and did worship , and said unto him , What sa@@ ith my lord unto his servant ?
and the captain of the LORD 's host said unto Joshua , Lo@@ ose thy shoe from off thy foot ; for the place where@@ on thou stand@@ est is holy . and Joshua did so .
and Joshua the son of N@@ un called the priests , and said unto them , Take up the ark of the covenant , and let seven priests bear seven trum@@ pets of r@@ ams ' horns before the ark of the LORD .
and he said unto the people , Pass on , and compass the city , and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD .
and it came to pass on the seventh day , that they rose early about the d@@ aw@@ ning of the day , and comp@@ assed the city after the same manner seven times : only on that day they comp@@ assed the city seven times .
and it came to pass at the seventh time , when the priests blew with the trum@@ pets , Joshua said unto the people , Sh@@ out ; for the LORD hath given you the city .
and they burnt the city with fire , and all that was therein : only the silver , and the gold , and the vessels of brass and of iron , they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD .
and Joshua sent men from Jer@@ ich@@ o to A@@ i , which is beside B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ A@@ ven , on the east side of Be@@ the@@ l , and sp@@ ake unto them , saying , Go up and view the country . and the men went up and viewed A@@ i .
and the men of A@@ i smo@@ te of them about thirty and six men : for they ch@@ ased them from before the gate even unto She@@ b@@ ari@@ m , and smo@@ te them in the going down : W@@ herefore the hearts of the people melted , and became as water .
and Joshua rent his clothes , and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the ev@@ enti@@ de , he and the elders of Israel , and put dust upon their heads .
therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies , but turned their backs before their enemies , because they were accur@@ sed : neither will I be with you any more , except ye destroy the accur@@ sed from among you .
up , sancti@@ fy the people , and say , Sanc@@ ti@@ fy yourselves against to mor@@ row : for thus sa@@ ith the LORD God of Israel , There is an accur@@ sed thing in the midst of thee , O Israel : thou can@@ st not stand before th@@ ine enemies , until ye take away the accur@@ sed thing from among you .
so Joshua rose up early in the morning , and brought Israel by their tribes ; and the tribe of Jud@@ ah was taken :
and he brought the family of Jud@@ ah ; and he took the family of the Zar@@ h@@ ites : and he brought the family of the Zar@@ h@@ ites man by man ; and Zab@@ di was taken :
and he brought his household man by man ; and Ach@@ an , the son of C@@ arm@@ i , the son of Zab@@ di , the son of Zer@@ ah , of the tribe of Jud@@ ah , was taken .
and Joshua said unto Ach@@ an , My son , give , I pray thee , glory to the LORD God of Israel , and make confession unto him ; and tell me now what thou hast done ; hide it not from me .
and Ach@@ an answered Joshua , and said , In@@ deed I have sin@@ ned against the LORD God of Israel , and thus and thus have I done :
and they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day . so the LORD turned from the fierc@@ eness of his anger . W@@ herefore the name of that place was called , The valley of Ach@@ or , unto this day .
so Joshua arose , and all the people of war , to go up against A@@ i : and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of val@@ our , and sent them away by night .
and he commanded them , saying , Be@@ hold , ye shall lie in wait against the city , even behind the city : go not very far from the city , but be ye all ready :
and I , and all the people that are with me , will approach unto the city : and it shall come to pass , when they come out against us , as at the first , that we will flee before them ,
( for they will come out after us ) till we have drawn them from the city ; for they will say , They flee before us , as at the first : therefore we will flee before them .
then ye shall rise up from the amb@@ ush , and seize upon the city : for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand .
and when they had set the people , even all the host that was on the north of the city , and their li@@ ers in wait on the west of the city , Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley .
and all the people that were in A@@ i were called together to pursue after them : and they pursued after Joshua , and were drawn away from the city .
and the LORD said unto Joshua , St@@ ret@@ ch out the spe@@ ar that is in thy hand toward A@@ i ; for I will give it into th@@ ine hand . and Joshua stretched out the spe@@ ar that he had in his hand toward the city .
and the amb@@ ush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand : and they entered into the city , and took it , and ha@@ sted and set the city on fire .
and when Joshua and all Israel saw that the amb@@ ush had taken the city , and that the smoke of the city asc@@ ended , then they turned again , and sle@@ w the men of A@@ i .
for Joshua drew not his hand back , where@@ with he stretched out the spe@@ ar , until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of A@@ i .
only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves , according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua .
as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel , as it is written in the book of the law of Moses , an altar of whole stones , over which no man hath lift up any iron : and they offered there@@ on burnt offerings unto the LORD , and sacrificed peace offerings .
and he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses , which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel .
they did work wil@@ ily , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old s@@ acks upon their asses , and wine bottles , old , and rent , and bound up ;
and they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gil@@ gal , and said unto him , and to the men of Israel , We be come from a far country : now therefore make ye a league with us .
and the men of Israel said unto the Hi@@ v@@ ites , Per@@ adventure ye dwell among us ; and how shall we make a league with you ?
and they said unto him , From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God : for we have heard the fame of him , and all that he did in Egypt ,
this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you ; but now , behold , it is dry , and it is m@@ oul@@ dy :
and these bottles of wine , which we filled , were new ; and , behold , they be rent : and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey .
and the children of Israel smo@@ te them not , because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel . and all the congregation mur@@ mu@@ red against the princes .
and Joshua called for them , and he sp@@ ake unto them , saying , W@@ herefore have ye be@@ gu@@ iled us , saying , We are very far from you ; when ye dwell among us ?
now therefore ye are cur@@ sed , and there shall none of you be freed from being bond@@ men , and he@@ w@@ ers of wood and draw@@ ers of water for the house of my God .
and so did he unto them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel , that they sle@@ w them not .
that they feared greatly , because Gi@@ be@@ on was a great city , as one of the royal cities , and because it was greater than A@@ i , and all the men thereof were mighty .
come up unto me , and help me , that we may sm@@ ite Gi@@ be@@ on : for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel .
and the LORD dis@@ com@@ f@@ ited them before Israel , and sle@@ w them with a great slaughter at Gi@@ be@@ on , and ch@@ ased them along the way that go@@ eth up to B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on , and smo@@ te them to A@@ ze@@ k@@ ah , and unto Mak@@ k@@ ed@@ ah .
and all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Mak@@ k@@ ed@@ ah in peace : none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel .
then said Joshua , Open the mouth of the cave , and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave .
and Joshua said unto them , Fe@@ ar not , nor be dis@@ may@@ ed , be strong and of good courage : for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight .
and afterward Joshua smo@@ te them , and sle@@ w them , and han@@ ged them on five trees : and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening .
and the LORD delivered L@@ ach@@ ish into the hand of Israel , which took it on the second day , and smo@@ te it with the edge of the sword , and all the souls that were therein , according to all that he had done to Lib@@ n@@ ah .
and they took it on that day , and smo@@ te it with the edge of the sword , and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day , according to all that he had done to L@@ ach@@ ish .
and to the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite on the east and on the west , and to the A@@ mor@@ ite , and the Hit@@ tite , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ite , and the Je@@ bus@@ ite in the mountains , and to the Hi@@ v@@ ite under Her@@ mon in the land of M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h .
and they went out , they and all their hosts with them , much people , even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude , with horses and ch@@ ari@@ ots very many .
and the LORD said unto Joshua , Be not afraid because of them : for to mor@@ row about this time will I deliver them up all sl@@ ain before Israel : thou shalt H@@ ough their horses , and burn their ch@@ ari@@ ots with fire .
and Joshua at that time turned back , and took Haz@@ or , and smo@@ te the king thereof with the sword : for Haz@@ or be@@ fore@@ time was the head of all those king@@ doms .
and they smo@@ te all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword , utterly destroying them : there was not any left to breathe : and he burnt Haz@@ or with fire .
but as for the cities that stood still in their strength , Israel burned none of them , save Haz@@ or only ; that did Joshua burn .
so Joshua took all that land , the hills , and all the south country , and all the land of Gos@@ hen , and the valley , and the plain , and the mountain of Israel , and the valley of the same ;
even from the mount Hal@@ ak , that go@@ eth up to Se@@ ir , even unto Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ g@@ ad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Her@@ mon : and all their kings he took , and smo@@ te them , and sle@@ w them .
there was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel , save the Hi@@ v@@ ites the inhabitants of Gi@@ be@@ on : all other they took in battle .
and at that time came Joshua , and cut off the An@@ ak@@ ims from the mountains , from He@@ br@@ on , from Deb@@ ir , from An@@ ab , and from all the mountains of Jud@@ ah , and from all the mountains of Israel : Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities .
there was none of the An@@ ak@@ ims left in the land of the children of Israel : only in Gaza , in G@@ ath , and in Ash@@ do@@ d , there remained .
so Joshua took the whole land , according to all that the LORD said unto Moses ; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes . and the land rested from war .
now these are the kings of the land , which the children of Israel smo@@ te , and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun , from the river Ar@@ non unto mount Her@@ mon , and all the plain on the east :
and from the plain to the sea of Chin@@ ner@@ o@@ th on the east , and unto the sea of the plain , even the salt sea on the east , the way to B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ j@@ es@@ him@@ o@@ th ; and from the south , under Ash@@ do@@ th @@@ -@@ @ p@@ is@@ g@@ ah :
and the coast of O@@ g king of Bash@@ an , which was of the remn@@ ant of the giants , that d@@ wel@@ t at Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th and at E@@ dre@@ i ,
and re@@ igned in mount Her@@ mon , and in Sal@@ ca@@ h , and in all Bash@@ an , unto the border of the G@@ es@@ hur@@ ites and the Ma@@ acha@@ th@@ ites , and half Gil@@ e@@ ad , the border of Si@@ hon king of H@@ esh@@ bon .
them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel sm@@ ite : and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites , and the G@@ ad@@ ites , and the half tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
in the mountains , and in the valleys , and in the plains , and in the springs , and in the wilderness , and in the south country ; the Hit@@ ti@@ tes , the A@@ mor@@ ites , and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ites , the Hi@@ v@@ ites , and the Je@@ bus@@ ites :
and all the cities of Si@@ hon king of the A@@ mor@@ ites , which re@@ igned in H@@ esh@@ bon , unto the border of the children of Am@@ mon ;
all the kingdom of O@@ g in Bash@@ an , which re@@ igned in Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th and in E@@ dre@@ i , who remained of the remn@@ ant of the giants : for these did Moses sm@@ ite , and cast them out .
nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the G@@ es@@ hur@@ ites , nor the Ma@@ acha@@ th@@ ites : but the G@@ es@@ hur@@ ites and the Ma@@ acha@@ th@@ ites dwell among the Israel@@ ites until this day .
and their coast was from A@@ ro@@ er , that is on the bank of the river Ar@@ non , and the city that is in the midst of the river , and all the plain by Me@@ deb@@ a ;
and Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of G@@ ad , even unto the children of G@@ ad according to their families .
and their coast was J@@ az@@ er , and all the cities of Gil@@ e@@ ad , and half the land of the children of Am@@ mon , unto A@@ ro@@ er that is before Rab@@ ba@@ h ;
and their coast was from Ma@@ han@@ aim , all Bash@@ an , all the kingdom of O@@ g king of Bash@@ an , and all the towns of J@@ air , which are in Bash@@ an , thre@@ es@@ core cities :
but unto the tribe of Lev@@ i Moses gave not any inheritance : the LORD God of Israel was their inheritance , as he said unto them .
for Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan : but unto the Lev@@ ites he gave none inheritance among them .
and the name of He@@ br@@ on before was Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ ba ; which Ar@@ ba was a great man among the An@@ ak@@ ims . and the land had rest from war .
this then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Jud@@ ah by their families ; even to the border of E@@ dom the wilderness of Z@@ in sou@@ th@@ ward was the utter@@ most part of the south coast .
and the east border was the salt sea , even unto the end of Jordan . and their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the utter@@ most part of Jordan :
and the border went up to B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ ho@@ gl@@ a , and passed along by the north of B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ Arab@@ ah ; and the border went up to the stone of Bo@@ han the son of Re@@ ub@@ en :
and the border comp@@ assed from Ba@@ al@@ ah w@@ est@@ ward unto mount Se@@ ir , and passed along unto the side of mount j@@ ear@@ im , which is Ch@@ es@@ al@@ on , on the north side , and went down to B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ Sh@@ em@@ esh , and passed on to Tim@@ n@@ ah :
and the border went out unto the side of Ek@@ ron nor@@ th@@ ward : and the border was drawn to Sh@@ ic@@ ron , and passed along to mount Ba@@ al@@ ah , and went out unto Jab@@ ne@@ el ; and the go@@ ings out of the border were at the sea .
and Cal@@ eb drove th@@ ence the three sons of An@@ ak , Sh@@ es@@ hai , and A@@ him@@ an , and Tal@@ ma@@ i , the children of An@@ ak .
and he went up th@@ ence to the inhabitants of Deb@@ ir : and the name of Deb@@ ir before was Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ Sep@@ her .
who answered , Gi@@ ve me a blessing ; for thou hast given me a south land ; give me also springs of water . and he gave her the upper springs , and the ne@@ ther springs .
and the utter@@ most cities of the tribe of the children of Jud@@ ah toward the coast of E@@ dom sou@@ th@@ ward were Kab@@ ze@@ el , and E@@ der , and Jag@@ ur ,
and Le@@ ba@@ o@@ th , and Sh@@ il@@ him , and A@@ in , and Rim@@ mon : all the cities are twenty and nine , with their villages :
as for the Je@@ bus@@ ites the inhabitants of Jerusalem , the children of Jud@@ ah could not drive them out : but the Je@@ bus@@ ites dwell with the children of Jud@@ ah at Jerusalem unto this day .
and the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by Jer@@ ich@@ o , unto the water of Jer@@ ich@@ o on the east , to the wilderness that go@@ eth up from Jer@@ ich@@ o throughout mount Be@@ the@@ l ,
and go@@ eth out from Be@@ the@@ l to Lu@@ z , and pass@@ eth along unto the borders of Arch@@ i to A@@ tar@@ o@@ th ,
and go@@ eth down w@@ est@@ ward to the coast of Jap@@ h@@ let@@ i , unto the coast of B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on the ne@@ ther , and to Ge@@ zer : and the go@@ ings out thereof are at the sea .
and the border went out toward the sea to Mic@@ h@@ meth@@ ah on the north side ; and the border went about eastward unto Ta@@ an@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ Sh@@ il@@ oh , and passed by it on the east to J@@ ano@@ ha@@ h ;
and it went down from J@@ ano@@ ha@@ h to A@@ tar@@ o@@ th , and to Na@@ ar@@ ath , and came to Jer@@ ich@@ o , and went out at Jordan .
but Z@@ elop@@ he@@ had , the son of H@@ ep@@ her , the son of Gil@@ e@@ ad , the son of Mach@@ ir , the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , had no sons , but daughters : and these are the names of his daughters , Mah@@ lah , and Noah , H@@ og@@ lah , Mil@@ ca@@ h , and Tir@@ z@@ ah .
and they came near before Ele@@ az@@ ar the priest , and before Joshua the son of N@@ un , and before the princes , saying , The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren . therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father .
and there fell ten portions to Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , beside the land of Gil@@ e@@ ad and Bash@@ an , which were on the other side Jordan ;
and the coast of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was from Ash@@ er to Mic@@ h@@ meth@@ ah , that li@@ eth before Sh@@ ec@@ hem ; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of E@@ n @@@ -@@ @ tap@@ pu@@ ah .
now Man@@ as@@ se@@ h had the land of T@@ ap@@ pu@@ ah : but T@@ ap@@ pu@@ ah on the border of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h belonged to the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ;
yet the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities ; but the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites would dwell in that land .
and the children of Joseph sp@@ ake unto Joshua , saying , Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit , seeing I am a great people , for@@ as@@ much as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto ?
and Joshua sp@@ ake unto the house of Joseph , even to E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and to Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , saying , Th@@ ou art a great people , and hast great power : thou shalt not have one lot only :
but the mountain shall be th@@ ine ; for it is a wood , and thou shalt cut it down : and the out@@ go@@ ings of it shall be th@@ ine : for thou shalt drive out the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , though they have iron ch@@ ari@@ ots , and though they be strong .
give out from among you three men for each tribe : and I will send them , and they shall rise , and go through the land , and describe it according to the inheritance of them ; and they shall come again to me .
and they shall divide it into seven parts : Jud@@ ah shall abide in their coast on the south , and the house of Joseph shall abide in their co@@ asts on the north .
ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts , and bring the description hi@@ ther to me , that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God .
but the Lev@@ ites have no part among you ; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance : and G@@ ad , and Re@@ ub@@ en , and half the tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east , which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them .
and Joshua cast lots for them in Sh@@ il@@ oh before the LORD : and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions .
and the border went over from th@@ ence toward Lu@@ z , to the side of Lu@@ z , which is Be@@ the@@ l , sou@@ th@@ ward ; and the border descended to A@@ tar@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ ad@@ ar , near the hill that li@@ eth on the south side of the ne@@ ther B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on .
and was drawn from the north , and went forth to E@@ n @@@ -@@ @ Sh@@ em@@ esh , and went forth toward Gel@@ il@@ o@@ th , which is over against the going up of Ad@@ um@@ mi@@ m , and descended to the stone of Bo@@ han the son of Re@@ ub@@ en ,
now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jer@@ ich@@ o , and B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ ho@@ g@@ lah , and the valley of K@@ ez@@ iz ,
and Zel@@ ah , Ele@@ ph , and Je@@ bus@@ i , which is Jerusalem , Gi@@ be@@ ath , and Kir@@ j@@ ath ; fourteen cities with their villages . this is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families .
and all the villages that were round about these cities to Ba@@ al@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ beer , Ram@@ ath of the south . this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Sim@@ eon according to their families .
out of the portion of the children of Jud@@ ah was the inheritance of the children of Sim@@ eon : for the part of the children of Jud@@ ah was too much for them : therefore the children of Sim@@ eon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them .
and their border went up toward the sea , and Mar@@ al@@ ah , and reached to D@@ ab@@ bas@@ h@@ eth , and reached to the river that is before Jo@@ kne@@ am ;
and from th@@ ence pass@@ eth on along on the east to G@@ it@@ tah @@@ -@@ @ hep@@ her , to It@@ tah @@@ -@@ @ k@@ az@@ in , and go@@ eth out to Rem@@ mon @@@ -@@ @ meth@@ o@@ ar to Ne@@ ah ;
and the coast re@@ ach@@ eth to Tab@@ or , and Sha@@ haz@@ im@@ ah , and B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ Sh@@ em@@ esh ; and the out@@ go@@ ings of their border were at Jordan : sixteen cities with their villages .
and then the coast tur@@ neth to Ram@@ ah , and to the strong city Ty@@ re ; and the coast tur@@ neth to Hos@@ ah ; and the out@@ go@@ ings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Ach@@ zi@@ b :
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ash@@ er according to their families , these cities with their villages .
and then the coast tur@@ neth w@@ est@@ ward to Az@@ no@@ th @@@ -@@ @ Tab@@ or , and go@@ eth out from th@@ ence to Hu@@ k@@ kok , and re@@ ach@@ eth to Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n on the south side , and re@@ ach@@ eth to Ash@@ er on the west side , and to Jud@@ ah upon Jordan toward the sun@@ rising .
this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families , these cities with their villages .
according to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked , even Tim@@ nat@@ h @@@ -@@ @ ser@@ ah in mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : and he built the city , and d@@ wel@@ t therein .
and they appointed K@@ ed@@ esh in Gal@@ ilee in mount N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i , and Sh@@ ec@@ hem in mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ ba , which is He@@ br@@ on , in the mountain of Jud@@ ah .
and they sp@@ ake unto them at Sh@@ il@@ oh in the land of Can@@ a@@ an , saying , The LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in , with the suburbs thereof for our cattle .
and the children of Israel gave unto the Lev@@ ites out of their inheritance , at the commandment of the LORD , these cities and their suburbs .
and the children of Ger@@ sh@@ on had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Is@@ sac@@ har , and out of the tribe of Ash@@ er , and out of the tribe of N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i , and out of the half tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in Bash@@ an , thirteen cities .
and the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Lev@@ ites these cities with their suburbs , as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses .
all the cities of the children of Aaron , the priests , were thirteen cities with their suburbs .
for they gave them Sh@@ ec@@ hem with her suburbs in mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , to be a city of refuge for the s@@ layer ; and Ge@@ zer with her suburbs ,
and out of the tribe of N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i , K@@ ed@@ esh in Gal@@ ilee with her suburbs , to be a city of refuge for the s@@ layer ; and Ham@@ moth @@@ -@@ @ DO@@ R with her suburbs , and K@@ art@@ an with her suburbs ; three cities .
and out of the tribe of Re@@ ub@@ en , B@@ ez@@ er with her suburbs , and Ja@@ haz@@ ah with her suburbs ,
and the LORD gave them rest round about , according to all that he sw@@ are unto their fathers : and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them ; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand .
and said unto them , Y@@ e have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you , and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you :
and now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren , as he promised them : therefore now return ye , and get you unto your tents , and unto the land of your possession , which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan .
now to the one half of the tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h Moses had given possession in Bash@@ an : but unto the other half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan w@@ est@@ ward . and when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents , then he blessed them ,
is the ini@@ qu@@ ity of Pe@@ or too little for us , from which we are not cleans@@ ed until this day , although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD ,
the LORD God of gods , the LORD God of gods , he know@@ eth , and Israel he shall know ; if it be in rebellion , or if in trans@@ g@@ ression against the LORD , ( save us not this day , )
for the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you , ye children of Re@@ ub@@ en and children of G@@ ad ; ye have no part in the LORD : so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD .
God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD , and turn this day from following the LORD , to build an altar for burnt offerings , for meat offerings , or for sacrifices , beside the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and when Ph@@ ine@@ has the priest , and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him , heard the words that the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and the children of G@@ ad and the children of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h sp@@ ake , it pleased them .
and the thing pleased the children of Israel ; and the children of Israel blessed God , and did not intend to go up against them in battle , to destroy the land where@@ in the children of Re@@ ub@@ en and G@@ ad d@@ wel@@ t .
and it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about , that Joshua wa@@ xed old and stricken in age .
and Joshua called for all Israel , and for their elders , and for their heads , and for their judges , and for their officers , and said unto them , I am old and stricken in age :
and ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you ; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you .
behold , I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain , to be an inheritance for your tribes , from Jordan , with all the nations that I have cut off , even unto the great sea w@@ est@@ ward .
and the LORD your God , he shall ex@@ pel them from before you , and drive them from out of your sight ; and ye shall possess their land , as the LORD your God hath promised unto you .
that ye come not among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow yourselves unto them :
else if ye do in any wise go back , and cle@@ ave unto the remn@@ ant of these nations , even these that remain among you , and shall make marriages with them , and go in unto them , and they to you :
and Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and called for the elders of Israel , and for their heads , and for their judges , and for their officers ; and they presented themselves before God .
and I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood , and led him throughout all the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and multiplied his seed , and gave him Isaac .
and I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Es@@ au : and I gave unto Es@@ au mount Se@@ ir , to possess it ; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt .
I sent Moses also and Aaron , and I plagued Egypt , according to that which I did among them : and afterward I brought you out .
and I brought you into the land of the A@@ mor@@ ites , which d@@ wel@@ t on the other side Jordan ; and they fought with you : and I gave them into your hand , that ye might possess their land ; and I destroyed them from before you .
and ye went over Jordan , and came unto Jer@@ ich@@ o : and the men of Jer@@ ich@@ o fought against you , the A@@ mor@@ ites , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ites , and the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the Hit@@ ti@@ tes , and the Gir@@ g@@ ash@@ ites , the Hi@@ v@@ ites , and the Je@@ bus@@ ites ; and I delivered them into your hand .
and I sent the hor@@ net before you , which dra@@ ve them out from before you , even the two kings of the A@@ mor@@ ites ; but not with thy sword , nor with thy bow .
now therefore fear the LORD , and serve him in sincerity and in truth : and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood , and in Egypt ; and serve ye the LORD .
and the LORD dra@@ ve out from before us all the people , even the A@@ mor@@ ites which d@@ wel@@ t in the land : therefore will we also serve the LORD ; for he is our God .
and Joshua said unto the people , Y@@ e C@@ AN@@ NOT serve the LORD : for he is an holy God ; he is a jeal@@ ous God ; he will not forgive your trans@@ gres@@ sions nor your sins .
if ye for@@ sake the LORD , and serve strange gods , then he will turn and do you hurt , and consume you , after that he hath done you good .
and Joshua said unto the people , Y@@ e are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD , to serve him . and they said , We are witnesses .
and Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God , and took a great stone , and set it up there under an oak , that was by the sanctuary of the LORD .
and Joshua said unto all the people , Be@@ hold , this stone shall be a witness unto us ; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he sp@@ ake unto us : it shall be therefore a witness unto you , lest ye deny your God .
and Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders that over@@ lived Joshua , and which had known all the works of the LORD , that he had done for Israel .
and Jud@@ ah said unto Sim@@ eon his brother , Come up with me into my lot , that we may fight against the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites ; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot . so Sim@@ eon went with him .
and they found Ad@@ oni @@@ -@@ @ B@@ ez@@ ek in B@@ ez@@ ek : and they fought against him , and they sle@@ w the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ites .
and Ad@@ oni @@@ -@@ @ B@@ ez@@ ek said , thre@@ es@@ core and ten kings , having their thum@@ bs and their great toes cut off , gathered their meat under my table : as I have done , so God hath requ@@ ited me . and they brought him to Jerusalem , and there he died .
and afterward the children of Jud@@ ah went down to fight against the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , that d@@ wel@@ t in the mountain , and in the south , and in the valley .
and Jud@@ ah went against the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites that d@@ wel@@ t in He@@ br@@ on : ( now the name of He@@ br@@ on before was Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ ba : ) and they sle@@ w Sh@@ es@@ hai , and A@@ him@@ an , and Tal@@ ma@@ i .
and from th@@ ence he went against the inhabitants of Deb@@ ir : and the name of Deb@@ ir before was Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ Sep@@ her :
and she said unto him , Gi@@ ve me a blessing : for thou hast given me a south land ; give me also springs of water . and Cal@@ eb gave her the upper springs and the ne@@ ther springs .
and the LORD was with Jud@@ ah ; and he dra@@ ve out the inhabitants of the mountain ; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had ch@@ ari@@ ots of iron .
and the house of Joseph , they also went up against Be@@ the@@ l : and the LORD was with them .
and the house of Joseph sent to desc@@ ry Be@@ the@@ l . ( now the name of the city before was Lu@@ z . )
and the man went into the land of the Hit@@ ti@@ tes , and built a city , and called the name thereof Lu@@ z : which is the name thereof unto this day .
and it came to pass , when Israel was strong , that they put the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites to tribute , and did not utterly drive them out .
neither did Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n drive out the inhabitants of Kit@@ ron , nor the inhabitants of Na@@ hal@@ ol ; but the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites d@@ wel@@ t among them , and became tribu@@ tar@@ ies .
but the Ash@@ er@@ ites d@@ wel@@ t among the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , the inhabitants of the land : for they did not drive them out .
and ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land ; ye shall throw down their al@@ t@@ ars : but ye have not obeyed my voice : why have ye done this ?
W@@ herefore I also said , I will not drive them out from before you ; but they shall be as thor@@ ns in your sides , and their gods shall be a sn@@ are unto you .
and the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua , and all the days of the elders that out@@ lived Joshua , who had seen all the great works of the LORD , that he did for Israel .
and Joshua the son of N@@ un , the servant of the LORD , died , being an hundred and ten years old .
and they for@@ s@@ ook the LORD God of their fathers , which brought them out of the land of Egypt , and followed other gods , of the gods of the people that were round about them , and bowed themselves unto them , and provoked the LORD to anger .
and the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel , and he delivered them into the hands of spo@@ il@@ ers that spoiled them , and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about , so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies .
W@@ hi@@ ther@@ soever they went out , the hand of the LORD was against them for evil , as the LORD had said , and as the LORD had sworn unto them : and they were greatly distressed .
and yet they would not hear@@ ken unto their judges , but they went a wh@@ oring after other gods , and bowed themselves unto them : they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in , obe@@ ying the commandments of the LORD ; but they did not so .
and when the LORD raised them up judges , then the LORD was with the judge , and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge : for it rep@@ ented the LORD because of their gro@@ an@@ ings by reason of them that oppressed them and v@@ exed them .
that through them I may prove Israel , whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein , as their fathers did keep it , or not .
now these are the nations which the LORD left , to prove Israel by them , even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Can@@ a@@ an ;
only that the generations of the children of Israel might know , to teach them war , at the least such as before knew nothing thereof ;
namely , five lords of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and all the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and the Sid@@ onians , and the Hi@@ v@@ ites that d@@ wel@@ t in mount Lebanon , from mount Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ Her@@ mon unto the entering in of Ham@@ ath .
and they were to prove Israel by them , to know whether they would hear@@ ken unto the commandments of the LORD , which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses .
and the children of Israel d@@ wel@@ t among the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , Hit@@ ti@@ tes , and A@@ mor@@ ites , and Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ites , and Hi@@ v@@ ites , and Je@@ bus@@ ites :
and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD , and for@@ g@@ at the LORD their God , and served Ba@@ ali@@ m and the gro@@ ves .
and when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD , the LORD raised up a deliver@@ er to the children of Israel , who delivered them , even O@@ th@@ ni@@ el the son of Ken@@ az , Cal@@ eb 's younger brother .
and the Spirit of the LORD came upon him , and he judged Israel , and went out to war : and the LORD delivered Ch@@ ush@@ an @@@ -@@ @ ris@@ ha@@ th@@ aim king of Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia into his hand ; and his hand prevailed against Ch@@ ush@@ an @@@ -@@ @ ris@@ ha@@ th@@ aim .
and the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD : and the LORD strengthened E@@ gl@@ on the king of Mo@@ ab against Israel , because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD .
and he gathered unto him the children of Am@@ mon and A@@ mal@@ ek , and went and smo@@ te Israel , and possessed the city of palm trees .
but when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD , the LORD raised them up a deliver@@ er , Ehud the son of Ger@@ a , a Ben@@ jam@@ ite , a man lef@@ than@@ ded : and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto E@@ gl@@ on the king of Mo@@ ab .
but Ehud made him a d@@ ag@@ ger which had two edges , of a cub@@ it length ; and he did gir@@ d it under his ra@@ iment upon his right thi@@ gh .
but he himself turned again from the quar@@ ries that were by Gil@@ gal , and said , I have a secret err@@ and unto thee , O king : who said , Keep silence . and all that stood by him went out from him .
and Ehud came unto him ; and he was sitting in a summer parl@@ our , which he had for himself alone . and Ehud said , I have a message from God unto thee . and he arose out of his seat .
and the ha@@ ft also went in after the blade ; and the fat closed upon the blade , so that he could not draw the d@@ ag@@ ger out of his belly ; and the dirt came out .
then Ehud went forth through the por@@ ch , and shut the doors of the parl@@ our upon him , and locked them .
when he was gone out , his servants came ; and when they saw that , behold , the doors of the parl@@ our were locked , they said , Su@@ rely he cover@@ eth his feet in his summer chamber .
and he said unto them , Fol@@ low after me : for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Mo@@ ab@@ ites into your hand . and they went down after him , and took the For@@ ds of Jordan toward Mo@@ ab , and suffered not a man to pass over .
and they sle@@ w of Mo@@ ab at that time about ten thousand men , all lu@@ sty , and all men of val@@ our ; and there escaped not a man .
so Mo@@ ab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel . and the land had rest four@@ score years .
and after him was Sham@@ gar the son of An@@ ath , which sle@@ w of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines six hundred men with an ox go@@ ad : and he also delivered Israel .
and the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD , when Ehud was dead .
and the LORD sold them into the hand of Jab@@ in king of Can@@ a@@ an , that re@@ igned in Haz@@ or ; the captain of whose host was S@@ is@@ era , which d@@ wel@@ t in Har@@ osh@@ eth of the Genti@@ les .
and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD : for he had nine hundred ch@@ ari@@ ots of iron ; and twenty years he mi@@ gh@@ tily oppressed the children of Israel .
and De@@ bor@@ ah , a proph@@ et@@ ess , the wife of L@@ api@@ do@@ th , she judged Israel at that time .
and Bar@@ ak said unto her , If thou wil@@ t go with me , then I will go : but if thou wil@@ t not go with me , then I will not go .
and S@@ is@@ era gathered together all his ch@@ ari@@ ots , even nine hundred ch@@ ari@@ ots of iron , and all the people that were with him , from Har@@ osh@@ eth of the Genti@@ les unto the river of K@@ ish@@ on .
and De@@ bor@@ ah said unto Bar@@ ak , Up ; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered S@@ is@@ era into th@@ ine hand : is not the LORD gone out before thee ? so Bar@@ ak went down from mount Tab@@ or , and ten thousand men after him .
How@@ be@@ it S@@ is@@ era fled away on his feet to the tent of Ja@@ el the wife of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite : for there was peace between Jab@@ in the king of Haz@@ or and the house of He@@ ber the Ken@@ ite .
and Ja@@ el went out to meet S@@ is@@ era , and said unto him , Turn in , my lord , turn in to me ; fear not . and when he had turned in unto her into the tent , she covered him with a mantle .
and he said unto her , Gi@@ ve me , I pray thee , a little water to drink ; for I am thir@@ sty . and she opened a bottle of milk , and gave him drink , and covered him .
again he said unto her , Stand in the door of the tent , and it shall be , when any man do@@ th come and inqu@@ ire of thee , and say , Is there any man here ? that thou shalt say , No .
and the hand of the children of Israel prosper@@ ed , and prevailed against Jab@@ in the king of Can@@ a@@ an , until they had destroyed Jab@@ in king of Can@@ a@@ an .
Lord , when thou w@@ ent@@ est out of Se@@ ir , when thou mar@@ ch@@ ed@@ st out of the field of E@@ dom , the earth trem@@ bled , and the heavens dropped , the clouds also dropped water .
my heart is toward the governors of Israel , that offered themselves willingly among the people . bless ye the LORD .
out of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im was there a root of them against A@@ mal@@ ek ; after thee , Benjamin , among thy people ; out of Mach@@ ir came down governors , and out of Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n they that handle the pen of the writer .
and the princes of Is@@ sac@@ har were with De@@ bor@@ ah ; even Is@@ sac@@ har , and also Bar@@ ak : he was sent on foot into the valley . for the divisions of Re@@ ub@@ en there were great thoughts of heart .
the kings came and fought , then fought the kings of Can@@ a@@ an in Ta@@ an@@ ach by the waters of Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do ; they took no gain of money .
the river of K@@ ish@@ on swept them away , that ancient river , the river K@@ ish@@ on . O my soul , thou hast tro@@ dden down strength .
curse ye Mer@@ oz , said the angel of the LORD , curse ye bit@@ terly the inhabitants thereof ; because they came not to the help of the LORD , to the help of the LORD against the mighty .
at her feet he bowed , he fell , he lay down : at her feet he bowed , he fell : where he bowed , there he fell down dead .
the mother of S@@ is@@ era looked out at a window , and cried through the lat@@ tice , Why is his ch@@ ari@@ ot so long in coming ? why tar@@ ry the wheels of his ch@@ ari@@ ots ?
so let all th@@ ine enemies perish , O LORD : but let them that love him be as the sun when he go@@ eth forth in his might . and the land had rest forty years .
and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD : and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Mi@@ dian seven years .
and they enc@@ amped against them , and destroyed the increase of the earth , till thou come unto Gaza , and left no sust@@ en@@ ance for Israel , neither sheep , nor ox , nor ass .
and Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites ; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD .
that the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel , which said unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD God of Israel , I brought you up from Egypt , and brought you forth out of the house of bond@@ age ;
and I said unto you , I am the LORD your God ; fear not the gods of the A@@ mor@@ ites , in whose land ye dwell : but ye have not obeyed my voice .
and there came an angel of the LORD , and sat under an oak which was in O@@ ph@@ rah , that per@@ tained unto Jo@@ ash the Ab@@ i @@@ -@@ @ ez@@ rite : and his son G@@ ide@@ on thresh@@ ed wheat by the win@@ ep@@ ress , to hide it from the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites .
and the LORD looked upon him , and said , Go in this thy might , and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites : have not I sent thee ?
and he said unto him , Oh my Lord , where@@ with shall I save Israel ? behold , my family is poor in Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and I am the least in my father 's house .
depart not hence , I pray thee , until I come unto thee , and bring forth my present , and set it before thee . and he said , I will tar@@ ry until thou come again .
and the angel of God said unto him , Take the flesh and the un@@ leav@@ ened cakes , and lay them upon this rock , and pour out the bro@@ th . and he did so .
and when G@@ ide@@ on perceived that he was an angel of the LORD , G@@ ide@@ on said , Al@@ as , O Lord GO@@ D ! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face .
then G@@ ide@@ on built an altar there unto the LORD , and called it Jehovah @@@ -@@ @ Shal@@ om : unto this day it is yet in O@@ ph@@ rah of the Ab@@ i @@@ -@@ @ ez@@ rites .
and build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock , in the ordered place , and take the second bul@@ lock , and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the gro@@ ve which thou shalt cut down .
and they said one to another , Who hath done this thing ? and when they inqui@@ red and asked , they said , G@@ ide@@ on the son of Jo@@ ash hath done this thing .
then all the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites and the children of the east were gathered together , and went over , and pit@@ ched in the valley of J@@ ez@@ re@@ el .
but the Spirit of the LORD came upon G@@ ide@@ on , and he blew a trum@@ pet ; and Ab@@ i @@@ -@@ @ E@@ zer was gathered after him .
and he sent messengers throughout all Man@@ as@@ se@@ h ; who also was gathered after him : and he sent messengers unto Ash@@ er , and unto Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n , and unto N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i ; and they came up to meet them .
behold , I will put a fle@@ ece of wool in the floor ; and if the de@@ w be on the fle@@ ece only , and it be dry upon all the earth beside , then shall I know that thou wil@@ t save Israel by mine hand , as thou hast said .
then Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al , who is G@@ ide@@ on , and all the people that were with him , rose up early , and pit@@ ched beside the well of Har@@ od : so that the host of the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites were on the north side of them , by the hill of More@@ h , in the valley .
now therefore go to , proclaim in the ears of the people , saying , Wh@@ oso@@ ever is fearful and afraid , let him return and depart early from mount Gil@@ e@@ ad . and there returned of the people twenty and two thousand ; and there remained ten thousand .
and the LORD said unto G@@ ide@@ on , By the three hundred men that lap@@ ped will I save you , and deliver the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites into th@@ ine hand : and let all the other people go every man unto his place .
so the people took vic@@ tu@@ als in their hand , and their trum@@ pets : and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent , and retained those three hundred men : and the host of Mi@@ dian was beneath him in the valley .
and thou shalt hear what they say ; and afterward shall th@@ ine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host . then went he down with Ph@@ ur@@ ah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host .
and the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like gras@@ shop@@ pers for multitude ; and their cam@@ els were without number , as the sand by the sea side for multitude .
and his fellow answered and said , This is nothing else save the sword of G@@ ide@@ on the son of Jo@@ ash , a man of Israel : for into his hand hath God delivered Mi@@ dian , and all the host .
and he divided the three hundred men into three companies , and he put a trum@@ pet in every man 's hand , with empty p@@ itch@@ ers , and lamps within the p@@ itch@@ ers .
and he said unto them , Look on me , and do likewise : and , behold , when I come to the outside of the camp , it shall be that , as I do , so shall ye do .
and the three companies blew the trum@@ pets , and brake the p@@ itch@@ ers , and held the lamps in their left hands , and the trum@@ pets in their right hands to blow with@@ al : and they cried , The sword of the LORD , and of G@@ ide@@ on .
and the three hundred blew the trum@@ pets , and the LORD set every man 's sword against his fellow , even throughout all the host : and the host fled to B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ it@@ tah in Zer@@ er@@ ath , and to the border of A@@ bel @@@ -@@ @ me@@ hol@@ ah , unto Tab@@ bath .
and the men of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im said unto him , Why hast thou served us thus , that thou cal@@ le@@ d@@ st us not , when thou w@@ ent@@ est to fight with the Mi@@ di@@ an@@ ites ? and they did chi@@ de with him sharply .
and he said unto them , What have I done now in comparison of you ? is not the g@@ leaning of the grapes of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im better than the v@@ intage of Ab@@ i @@@ -@@ @ E@@ zer ?
God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Mi@@ dian , O@@ re@@ b and Ze@@ eb : and what was I able to do in comparison of you ? then their anger was abated toward him , when he had said that .
and the princes of S@@ uc@@ co@@ th said , Are the hands of Ze@@ ba@@ h and Z@@ al@@ mun@@ na now in th@@ ine hand , that we should give bread unto th@@ ine army ?
now Ze@@ ba@@ h and Z@@ al@@ mun@@ na were in Kar@@ k@@ or , and their hosts with them , about fifteen thousand men , all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east : for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword .
then said he unto Ze@@ ba@@ h and Z@@ al@@ mun@@ na , What manner of men were they whom ye sle@@ w at Tab@@ or ? and they answered , As thou art , so were they ; each one resem@@ bled the children of a king .
and G@@ ide@@ on made an ep@@ ho@@ d thereof , and put it in his city , even in O@@ ph@@ rah : and all Israel went thi@@ ther a wh@@ oring after it : which thing became a sn@@ are unto G@@ ide@@ on , and to his house .
thus was Mi@@ dian subdued before the children of Israel , so that they lifted up their heads no more . and the country was in qui@@ et@@ ness forty years in the days of G@@ ide@@ on .
and G@@ ide@@ on the son of Jo@@ ash died in a good old age , and was buried in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of Jo@@ ash his father , in O@@ ph@@ rah of the Ab@@ i @@@ -@@ @ ez@@ rites .
and the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God , who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side :
neither sh@@ ew@@ ed they kindness to the house of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al , namely , G@@ ide@@ on , according to all the goodness which he had sh@@ ew@@ ed unto Israel .
and Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h the son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al went to Sh@@ ec@@ hem unto his mother 's brethren , and commun@@ ed with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
and his mother 's brethren sp@@ ake of him in the ears of all the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem all these words : and their hearts inclined to follow Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h ; for they said , He is our brother .
and they gave him thre@@ es@@ core and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ ber@@ ith , where@@ with Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h hired vain and light persons , which followed him .
and he went unto his father 's house at O@@ ph@@ rah , and sle@@ w his brethren the sons of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al , being thre@@ es@@ core and ten persons , upon one stone : notwithstanding yet Jo@@ th@@ am the youngest son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al was left ; for he hid himself .
and when they told it to Jo@@ th@@ am , he went and stood in the top of mount Ger@@ iz@@ im , and lifted up his voice , and cried , and said unto them , hear@@ ken unto me , ye men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , that God may hear@@ ken unto you .
but the olive tree said unto them , Should I leave my fat@@ ness , where@@ with by me they honour God and man , and go to be promoted over the trees ?
but the fi@@ g tree said unto them , Should I for@@ sake my sweet@@ ness , and my good fruit , and go to be promoted over the trees ?
and the br@@ am@@ ble said unto the trees , If in truth ye ano@@ int me king over you , then come and put your trust in my shadow : and if not , let fire come out of the br@@ am@@ ble , and dev@@ our the c@@ ed@@ ars of Lebanon .
now therefore , if ye have done truly and sincerely , in that ye have made Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h king , and if ye have dealt well with Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al and his house , and have done unto him according to the deserv@@ ing of his hands ;
( for my father fought for you , and advent@@ ured his life far , and delivered you out of the hand of Mi@@ dian :
and ye are risen up against my father 's house this day , and have sl@@ ain his sons , thre@@ es@@ core and ten persons , upon one stone , and have made Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h , the son of his mai@@ d@@ servant , king over the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , because he is your brother ; )
but if not , let fire come out from Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h , and dev@@ our the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and the house of Mill@@ o ; and let fire come out from the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and from the house of Mill@@ o , and dev@@ our Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h .
and the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem set li@@ ers in wait for him in the top of the mountains , and they robbed all that came along that way by them : and it was told Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h .
and they went out into the fields , and gathered their vineyards , and tro@@ de the grapes , and made mer@@ ry , and went into the house of their god , and did eat and drink , and cur@@ sed Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h .
and when Ze@@ bul the ruler of the city heard the words of Ga@@ al the son of E@@ bed , his anger was kind@@ led .
and Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h rose up , and all the people that were with him , by night , and they laid wait against Sh@@ ec@@ hem in four companies .
and Ga@@ al sp@@ ake again and said , See there come people down by the middle of the land , and another company come along by the plain of Me@@ on@@ en@@ im .
then said Ze@@ bul unto him , Where is now thy mouth , where@@ with thou s@@ ai@@ d@@ st , Who is Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h , that we should serve him ? is not this the people that thou hast desp@@ ised ? go out , I pray now , and fight with them .
and he took the people , and divided them into three companies , and laid wait in the field , and looked , and , behold , the people were come forth out of the city ; and he rose up against them , and smo@@ te them .
and Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h , and the company that was with him , rushed forward , and stood in the entering of the gate of the city : and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields , and sle@@ w them .
and Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h fought against the city all that day ; and he took the city , and sle@@ w the people that was therein , and beat down the city , and s@@ owed it with salt .
and all the people likewise cut down every man his b@@ ough , and followed Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h , and put them to the hold , and set the hold on fire upon them ; so that all the men of the tower of Sh@@ ec@@ hem died also , about a thousand men and women .
and Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h came unto the tower , and fought against it , and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire .
then he called hastily unto the young man his arm@@ our@@ be@@ arer , and said unto him , D@@ raw thy sword , and sl@@ ay me , that men say not of me , A woman sle@@ w him . and his young man thrust him through , and he died .
and all the evil of the men of Sh@@ ec@@ hem did God render upon their heads : and upon them came the curse of Jo@@ th@@ am the son of Jer@@ ub@@ ba@@ al .
and after Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h there arose to defend Israel T@@ ola the son of Pu@@ ah , the son of Do@@ do , a man of Is@@ sac@@ har ; and he d@@ wel@@ t in Sham@@ ir in mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
and that year they v@@ exed and oppressed the children of Israel : eighteen years , all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the A@@ mor@@ ites , which is in Gil@@ e@@ ad .
moreover the children of Am@@ mon passed over Jordan to fight also against Jud@@ ah , and against Benjamin , and against the house of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; so that Israel was sore distressed .
and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD , saying , We have sin@@ ned against thee , both because we have for@@ s@@ aken our God , and also served Ba@@ ali@@ m .
the Z@@ id@@ onians also , and the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and the Ma@@ on@@ ites , did op@@ press you ; and ye cried to me , and I delivered you out of their hand .
and they put away the strange gods from among them , and served the LORD : and his soul was griev@@ ed for the misery of Israel .
and Gil@@ e@@ ad 's wife bare him sons ; and his wife 's sons grew up , and they thrust out J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah , and said unto him , Th@@ ou shalt not inherit in our father 's house ; for thou art the son of a strange woman .
then J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah fled from his brethren , and d@@ wel@@ t in the land of To@@ b : and there were gathered vain men to J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah , and went out with him .
and they said unto J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah , Come , and be our captain , that we may fight with the children of Am@@ mon .
and J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah said unto the elders of Gil@@ e@@ ad , Did not ye hate me , and ex@@ pel me out of my father 's house ? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress ?
and the elders of Gil@@ e@@ ad said unto J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah , T@@ herefore we turn again to thee now , that thou may@@ est go with us , and fight against the children of Am@@ mon , and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gil@@ e@@ ad .
and J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah said unto the elders of Gil@@ e@@ ad , If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Am@@ mon , and the LORD deliver them before me , shall I be your head ?
and the elders of Gil@@ e@@ ad said unto J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah , The LORD be witness between us , if we do not so according to thy words .
and J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Am@@ mon , saying , What hast thou to do with me , that thou art come against me to fight in my land ?
and Israel sent messengers unto Si@@ hon king of the A@@ mor@@ ites , the king of H@@ esh@@ bon ; and Israel said unto him , Let us pass , we pray thee , through thy land into my place .
and the LORD God of Israel delivered Si@@ hon and all his people into the hand of Israel , and they smo@@ te them : so Israel possessed all the land of the A@@ mor@@ ites , the inhabitants of that country .
and now art thou any thing better than Bal@@ ak the son of Zi@@ pp@@ or , king of Mo@@ ab ? did he ever strive against Israel , or did he ever fight against them ,
W@@ herefore I have not sin@@ ned against thee , but thou do@@ est me wrong to war against me : the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Am@@ mon .
then the Spirit of the LORD came upon J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah , and he passed over Gil@@ e@@ ad , and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and passed over M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of Gil@@ e@@ ad , and from M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h of Gil@@ e@@ ad he passed over unto the children of Am@@ mon .
and she said unto her father , Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may go up and down upon the mountains , and be@@ w@@ ail my vir@@ g@@ inity , I and my fellows .
and it came to pass at the end of two months , that she returned unto her father , who did with her according to his vo@@ w which he had vowed : and she knew no man . and it was a custom in Israel ,
that the daughters of Israel went yearly to lam@@ ent the daughter of J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah the Gil@@ e@@ ad@@ ite four days in a year .
and J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah said unto them , I and my people were at great strife with the children of Am@@ mon ; and when I called you , ye delivered me not out of their hands .
and when I saw that ye delivered me not , I put my life in my hands , and passed over against the children of Am@@ mon , and the LORD delivered them into my hand : W@@ herefore then are ye come up unto me this day , to fight against me ?
then J@@ eph@@ th@@ ah gathered together all the men of Gil@@ e@@ ad , and fought with E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : and the men of Gil@@ e@@ ad smo@@ te E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , because they said , Y@@ e Gil@@ e@@ ad@@ ites are fu@@ gi@@ tives of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im among the E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im@@ ites , and among the Man@@ ass@@ ites .
and the Gil@@ e@@ ad@@ ites took the passages of Jordan before the E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im@@ ites : and it was so , that when those E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im@@ ites which were escaped said , Let me go over ; that the men of Gil@@ e@@ ad said unto him , Art thou an E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im@@ ite ? if he said , N@@ ay ;
and Ab@@ don the son of Hil@@ lel the Pir@@ ath@@ on@@ ite died , and was buried in Pir@@ athon in the land of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , in the mount of the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites .
and the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD ; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines forty years .
and there was a certain man of Zor@@ ah , of the family of the Dan@@ ites , whose name was Man@@ o@@ ah ; and his wife was bar@@ ren , and bare not .
for , lo , thou shalt conceive , and bear a son ; and no r@@ as@@ or shall come on his head : for the child shall be a Nazar@@ ite unto God from the womb : and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
but he said unto me , Be@@ hold , thou shalt conceive , and bear a son ; and now drink no wine nor strong drink , neither eat any un@@ clean thing : for the child shall be a Nazar@@ ite to God from the womb to the day of his death .
then Man@@ o@@ ah int@@ re@@ ated the LORD , and said , O my Lord , let the man of God which thou did@@ st send come again unto us , and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born .
and Man@@ o@@ ah arose , and went after his wife , and came to the man , and said unto him , Art thou the man that sp@@ ak@@ est unto the woman ? and he said , I am .
and the angel of the LORD said unto Man@@ o@@ ah , Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware .
she may not eat of any thing that com@@ eth of the vine , neither let her drink wine or strong drink , nor eat any un@@ clean thing : all that I commanded her let her observe .
and the angel of the LORD said unto Man@@ o@@ ah , Th@@ ough thou det@@ ain me , I will not eat of thy bread : and if thou wil@@ t offer a burnt offering , thou must offer it unto the LORD . for Man@@ o@@ ah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD .
and Man@@ o@@ ah said unto the angel of the LORD , What is thy name , that when thy say@@ ings come to pass we may do thee honour ?
so Man@@ o@@ ah took a kid with a meat offering , and offered it upon a rock unto the LORD : and the angel did won@@ dr@@ ously ; and Man@@ o@@ ah and his wife looked on .
but his wife said unto him , If the LORD were pleased to kill us , he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands , neither would he have sh@@ ew@@ ed us all these things , nor would as at this time have told us such things as these .
and the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zor@@ ah and E@@ sh@@ ta@@ ol .
and Sam@@ son went down to Tim@@ nat@@ h , and saw a woman in Tim@@ nat@@ h of the daughters of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and he came up , and told his father and his mother , and said , I have seen a woman in Tim@@ nat@@ h of the daughters of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : now therefore get her for me to wife .
and the Spirit of the LORD came mi@@ gh@@ tily upon him , and he rent him as he would have rent a kid , and he had nothing in his hand : but he told not his father or his mother what he had done .
and after a time he returned to take her , and he turned aside to see the car@@ case of the lion : and , behold , there was a s@@ warm of bees and honey in the car@@ case of the lion .
so his father went down unto the woman : and Sam@@ son made there a feast ; for so used the young men to do .
and Sam@@ son said unto them , I will now put forth a rid@@ dle unto you : if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast , and find it out , then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments :
but if ye C@@ AN@@ NOT declare it me , then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments . and they said unto him , P@@ ut forth thy rid@@ dle , that we may hear it .
and he said unto them , Out of the e@@ ater came forth meat , and out of the strong came forth sweet@@ ness . and they could not in three days exp@@ ound the rid@@ dle .
and she we@@ pt before him the seven days , while their feast lasted : and it came to pass on the seventh day , that he told her , because she lay sore upon him : and she told the rid@@ dle to the children of her people .
and her father said , I verily thought that thou had@@ st utterly hated her ; therefore I gave her to thy companion : is not her younger sister fairer than she ? take her , I pray thee , instead of her .
and Sam@@ son said concerning them , Now shall I be more bl@@ am@@ eless than the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , though I do them a dis@@ pleasure .
then the Phil@@ ist@@ ines said , Who hath done this ? and they answered , Sam@@ son , the son in law of the Tim@@ n@@ ite , because he had taken his wife , and given her to his companion . and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came up , and burnt her and her father with fire .
and Sam@@ son said unto them , Th@@ ough ye have done this , yet will I be av@@ eng@@ ed of you , and after that I will cease .
and the men of Jud@@ ah said , Why are ye come up against us ? and they answered , To bind Sam@@ son are we come up , to do to him as he hath done to us .
and they said unto him , We are come down to bind thee , that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . and Sam@@ son said unto them , swear unto me , that ye will not fall upon me yourselves .
and they sp@@ ake unto him , saying , No ; but we will bind thee fast , and deliver thee into their hand : but surely we will not kill thee . and they bound him with two new cor@@ ds , and brought him up from the rock .
and when he came unto Le@@ hi , the Phil@@ ist@@ ines shouted against him : and the Spirit of the LORD came mi@@ gh@@ tily upon him , and the cor@@ ds that were upon his arms became as fla@@ x that was burnt with fire , and his bands loos@@ ed from off his hands .
and he found a new j@@ aw@@ bone of an ass , and put forth his hand , and took it , and sle@@ w a thousand men there@@ with .
and he was sore ath@@ ir@@ st , and called on the LORD , and said , Th@@ ou hast given this great deliver@@ ance into the hand of thy servant : and now shall I die for thirst , and fall into the hand of the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised ?
and it came to pass afterward , that he loved a woman in the valley of S@@ ore@@ k , whose name was Del@@ il@@ ah .
and Del@@ il@@ ah said to Sam@@ son , Tell me , I pray thee , where@@ in thy great strength li@@ eth , and where@@ with thou mi@@ gh@@ test be bound to aff@@ l@@ ict thee .
and Sam@@ son said unto her , If they bind me with seven green with@@ s that were never dried , then shall I be weak , and be as another man .
then the lords of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines brought up to her seven green with@@ s which had not been dried , and she bound him with them .
and Del@@ il@@ ah said unto Sam@@ son , Be@@ hold , thou hast mo@@ cked me , and told me lies : now tell me , I pray thee , where@@ with thou mi@@ gh@@ test be bound .
and it came to pass , when she pressed him daily with her words , and urged him , so that his soul was v@@ exed unto death ;
and she made him sleep upon her knees ; and she called for a man , and she caused him to s@@ have off the seven locks of his head ; and she began to aff@@ l@@ ict him , and his strength went from him .
and she said , The Phil@@ ist@@ ines be upon thee , Sam@@ son . and he aw@@ oke out of his sleep , and said , I will go out as at other times before , and shake myself . and he w@@ ist not that the LORD was departed from him .
but the Phil@@ ist@@ ines took him , and put out his eyes , and brought him down to Gaza , and bound him with fet@@ ters of brass ; and he did gr@@ ind in the prison house .
then the lords of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto D@@ agon their god , and to rejoice : for they said , Our god hath delivered Sam@@ son our enemy into our hand .
and when the people saw him , they praised their god : for they said , Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy , and the destro@@ yer of our country , which sle@@ w many of us .
now the house was full of men and women ; and all the lords of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were there ; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women , that be@@ held while Sam@@ son made sport .
and Sam@@ son took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood , and on which it was borne up , of the one with his right hand , and of the other with his left .
then his brethren and all the house of his father came down , and took him , and brought him up , and buried him between Zor@@ ah and E@@ sh@@ ta@@ ol in the bur@@ ying place of Man@@ o@@ ah his father . and he judged Israel twenty years .
yet he restored the money unto his mother ; and his mother took two hundred she@@ k@@ els of silver , and gave them to the founder , who made thereof a gra@@ ven image and a mol@@ ten image : and they were in the house of Mic@@ ah .
and the man departed out of the city from Beth@@ le@@ hem@@ jud@@ ah to so@@ jour@@ n where he could find a place : and he came to mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to the house of Mic@@ ah , as he jour@@ ne@@ yed .
and Mic@@ ah said unto him , wh@@ ence com@@ est thou ? and he said unto him , I am a Lev@@ ite of Beth@@ le@@ hem@@ jud@@ ah , and I go to so@@ jour@@ n where I may find a place .
and they said unto him , As@@ k counsel , we pray thee , of God , that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous .
when ye go , ye shall come unto a people secure , and to a large land : for God hath given it into your hands ; a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth .
and they went up , and pit@@ ched in Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im , in Jud@@ ah : W@@ herefore they called that place Ma@@ han@@ eh @@@ -@@ @ dan unto this day : behold , it is behind Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im .
then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of La@@ ish , and said unto their brethren , Do ye know that there is in these houses an ep@@ ho@@ d , and ter@@ ap@@ him , and a gra@@ ven image , and a mol@@ ten image ? now therefore consider what ye have to do .
and these went into Mic@@ ah 's house , and fetched the carved image , the ep@@ ho@@ d , and the ter@@ ap@@ him , and the mol@@ ten image . then said the priest unto them , What do ye ?
so they turned and departed , and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them .
and he said , Y@@ e have taken away my gods which I made , and the priest , and ye are gone away : and what have I more ? and what is this that ye say unto me , What ail@@ eth thee ?
and the children of Dan said unto him , Let not thy voice be heard among us , lest angry fellows run upon thee , and thou lose thy life , with the lives of thy household .
and they took the things which Mic@@ ah had made , and the priest which he had , and came unto La@@ ish , unto a people that were at quiet and secure : and they smo@@ te them with the edge of the sword , and burnt the city with fire .
and they called the name of the city Dan , after the name of Dan their father , who was born unto Israel : How@@ be@@ it the name of the city was La@@ ish at the first .
and the children of Dan set up the gra@@ ven image : and Jonathan , the son of Ger@@ sh@@ om , the son of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the cap@@ tivity of the land .
and his conc@@ ub@@ ine played the wh@@ ore against him , and went away from him unto her father 's house to Beth@@ le@@ hem@@ jud@@ ah , and was there four whole months .
but the man would not tar@@ ry that night , but he rose up and departed , and came over against Je@@ bus , which is Jerusalem ; and there were with him two asses sadd@@ led , his conc@@ ub@@ ine also was with him .
and his master said unto him , We will not turn aside hi@@ ther into the city of a stranger , that is not of the children of Israel ; we will pass over to Gi@@ be@@ ah .
and they turned aside thi@@ ther , to go in and to lodge in Gi@@ be@@ ah : and when he went in , he sat him down in a street of the city : for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging .
and , behold , there came an old man from his work out of the field at even , which was also of mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; and he so@@ jour@@ ned in Gi@@ be@@ ah : but the men of the place were Ben@@ jam@@ ites .
and when he had lifted up his eyes , he saw a way@@ far@@ ing man in the street of the city : and the old man said , whi@@ ther go@@ est thou ? and wh@@ ence com@@ est thou ?
and he said unto him , We are passing from Beth@@ le@@ hem@@ jud@@ ah toward the side of mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; from th@@ ence am I : and I went to Beth@@ le@@ hem@@ jud@@ ah , but I am now going to the house of the LORD ; and there is no man that recei@@ v@@ eth me to house .
yet there is both straw and pro@@ ven@@ der for our asses ; and there is bread and wine also for me , and for thy hand@@ maid , and for the young man which is with thy servants : there is no want of any thing .
and the old man said , Peace be with thee ; how@@ soever let all thy wants lie upon me ; only lodge not in the street .
behold , here is my daughter a mai@@ den , and his conc@@ ub@@ ine ; them I will bring out now , and humble ye them , and do with them what seem@@ eth good unto you : but unto this man do not so v@@ ile a thing .
then came the woman in the d@@ aw@@ ning of the day , and fell down at the door of the man 's house where her lord was , till it was light .
and he said unto her , Up , and let us be going . but none answered . then the man took her up upon an ass , and the man rose up , and G@@ at him unto his place .
then all the children of Israel went out , and the congregation was gathered together as one man , from Dan even to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba , with the land of Gil@@ e@@ ad , unto the LORD in M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h .
( now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h . ) Then said the children of Israel , Tell us , how was this w@@ ick@@ edness ?
and the men of Gi@@ be@@ ah rose against me , and bes@@ et the house round about upon me by night , and thought to have sl@@ ain me : and my conc@@ ub@@ ine have they forced , that she is dead .
and all the people arose as one man , saying , We will not any of us go to his tent , neither will we any of us turn into his house .
so all the men of Israel were gathered against the city , knit together as one man .
and the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin , saying , What w@@ ick@@ edness is this that is done among you ?
and the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword , beside the inhabitants of Gi@@ be@@ ah , which were numbered seven hundred chosen men .
and the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves , and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day .
( and the children of Israel went up and we@@ pt before the LORD until even , and asked counsel of the LORD , saying , Sh@@ all I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother ? and the LORD said , Go up against him . )
and Benjamin went forth against them out of Gi@@ be@@ ah the second day , and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men ; all these drew the sword .
then all the children of Israel , and all the people , went up , and came unto the house of God , and we@@ pt , and sat there before the LORD , and fast@@ ed that day until even , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD .
and the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day , and put themselves in array against Gi@@ be@@ ah , as at other times .
and the children of Benjamin said , They are sm@@ it@@ ten down before us , as at the first . but the children of Israel said , Let us flee , and draw them from the city unto the highways .
and the LORD smo@@ te Benjamin before Israel : and the children of Israel destroyed of the Ben@@ jam@@ ites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men : all these drew the sword .
so the children of Benjamin saw that they were sm@@ it@@ ten : for the men of Israel gave place to the Ben@@ jam@@ ites , because they trusted unto the li@@ ers in wait which they had set beside Gi@@ be@@ ah .
and they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rim@@ mon : and they g@@ leaned of them in the highways five thousand men ; and pursued hard after them unto Gi@@ dom , and sle@@ w two thousand men of them .
now the men of Israel had sworn in M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h , saying , There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife .
and said , O LORD God of Israel , why is this come to pass in Israel , that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel ?
and the children of Israel rep@@ ented them for Benjamin their brother , and said , There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day .
how shall we do for wives for them that remain , seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives ?
and they said , What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h to the LORD ? and , behold , there came none to the camp from Jab@@ esh @@@ -@@ @ Gil@@ e@@ ad to the assembly .
and the congregation sent thi@@ ther twelve thousand men of the val@@ i@@ ant@@ est , and commanded them , saying , Go and sm@@ ite the inhabitants of Jab@@ esh @@@ -@@ @ Gil@@ e@@ ad with the edge of the sword , with the women and the children .
and this is the thing that ye shall do , Y@@ e shall utterly destroy every male , and every woman that hath lain by man .
and the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of Benjamin that were in the rock Rim@@ mon , and to call peace@@ ably unto them .
then the elders of the congregation said , How shall we do for wives for them that remain , seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin ?
and they said , There must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin , that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel .
How@@ be@@ it we may not give them wives of our daughters : for the children of Israel have sworn , saying , Cur@@ sed be he that gi@@ v@@ eth a wife to Benjamin .
then they said , Be@@ hold , there is a feast of the LORD in Sh@@ il@@ oh yearly in a place which is on the north side of Be@@ the@@ l , on the east side of the highway that go@@ eth up from Be@@ the@@ l to Sh@@ ec@@ hem , and on the south of Le@@ bon@@ ah .
therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin , saying , Go and lie in wait in the vineyards ;
and the children of Benjamin did so , and took them wives , according to their number , of them that danced , whom they caught : and they went and returned unto their inheritance , and repaired the cities , and d@@ wel@@ t in them .
and the children of Israel departed th@@ ence at that time , every man to his tribe and to his family , and they went out from th@@ ence every man to his inheritance .
now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled , that there was a famine in the land . and a certain man of Beth@@ le@@ hem@@ jud@@ ah went to so@@ jour@@ n in the country of Mo@@ ab , he , and his wife , and his two sons .
and the name of the man was E@@ lim@@ elec@@ h , and the name of his wife Na@@ omi , and the name of his two sons Mah@@ lon and Ch@@ ilion , E@@ ph@@ ra@@ th@@ ites of Beth@@ le@@ hem@@ jud@@ ah . and they came into the country of Mo@@ ab , and continued there .
W@@ herefore she went forth out of the place where she was , and her two daughters in law with her ; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Jud@@ ah .
and Na@@ omi said unto her two daughters in law , Go , return each to her mother 's house : the LORD deal kindly with you , as ye have dealt with the dead , and with me .
the LORD grant you that ye may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . then she kis@@ sed them ; and they lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt .
so they two went until they came to Bethlehem . and it came to pass , when they were come to Bethlehem , that all the city was moved about them , and they said , Is this Na@@ omi ?
I went out full , and the LORD hath brought me home again empty : why then call ye me Na@@ omi , seeing the LORD hath testified against me , and the Almighty hath afflicted me ?
so Na@@ omi returned , and Ru@@ th the Mo@@ ab@@ it@@ ess , her daughter in law , with her , which returned out of the country of Mo@@ ab : and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
and Na@@ omi had a kin@@ sman of her husband 's , a mighty man of wealth , of the family of E@@ lim@@ elec@@ h ; and his name was Bo@@ az .
and Ru@@ th the Mo@@ ab@@ it@@ ess said unto Na@@ omi , Let me now go to the field , and g@@ lean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find grace . and she said unto her , Go , my daughter .
and she went , and came , and g@@ leaned in the field after the re@@ apers : and her H@@ AP was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Bo@@ az , who was of the kind@@ red of E@@ lim@@ elec@@ h .
and behold , Bo@@ az came from Bethlehem , and said unto the re@@ apers , The LORD be with you . and they answered him , The LORD bless thee .
and the servant that was set over the re@@ apers answered and said , It is the Mo@@ ab@@ iti@@ sh dam@@ sel that came back with Na@@ omi out of the country of Mo@@ ab :
and she said , I pray you , let me g@@ lean and gather after the re@@ apers among the she@@ aves : so she came , and hath continued even from the morning until now , that she tar@@ ried a little in the house .
then said Bo@@ az unto Ru@@ th , He@@ arest thou not , my daughter ? go not to g@@ lean in another field , neither go from hence , but abide here fast by my mai@@ dens :
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said unto him , Why have I found grace in th@@ ine eyes , that thou shoul@@ dest take knowledge of me , seeing I am a stranger ?
and Bo@@ az said unto her , At me@@ al@@ time come thou hi@@ ther , and eat of the bread , and dip thy mor@@ sel in the vin@@ eg@@ ar . and she sat beside the re@@ apers : and he reached her par@@ ched corn , and she did eat , and was suff@@ iced , and left .
and she took it up , and went into the city : and her mother in law saw what she had g@@ leaned : and she brought forth , and gave to her that she had reserved after she was suff@@ iced .
and Ru@@ th the Mo@@ ab@@ it@@ ess said , He said unto me also , Th@@ ou shalt keep fast by my young men , until they have ended all my harvest .
and Na@@ omi said unto Ru@@ th her daughter in law , It is good , my daughter , that thou go out with his mai@@ dens , that they meet thee not in any other field .
then Na@@ omi her mother in law said unto her , My daughter , shall I not seek rest for thee , that it may be well with thee ?
and she went down unto the floor , and did according to all that her mother in law b@@ ade her .
and when Bo@@ az had eaten and drunk , and his heart was mer@@ ry , he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn : and she came softly , and uncovered his feet , and laid her down .
and when she came to her mother in law , she said , Who art thou , my daughter ? and she told her all that the man had done to her .
then said she , S@@ it still , my daughter , until thou know how the matter will fall : for the man will not be in rest , until he have finished the thing this day .
then went Bo@@ az up to the gate , and sat him down there : and , behold , the kin@@ sman of whom Bo@@ az sp@@ ake came by ; unto whom he said , H@@ o , such a one ! turn aside , sit down here . and he turned aside , and sat down .
and he took ten men of the elders of the city , and said , S@@ it ye down here . and they sat down .
then said Bo@@ az , What day thou buy@@ est the field of the hand of Na@@ omi , thou must buy it also of Ru@@ th the Mo@@ ab@@ it@@ ess , the wife of the dead , to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance .
now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning re@@ deem@@ ing and concerning changing , for to confirm all things ; a man pl@@ ucked off his shoe , and gave it to his neighbour : and this was a testimony in Israel .
and the women said unto Na@@ omi , Bless@@ ed be the LORD , which hath not left thee this day without a kin@@ sman , that his name may be famous in Israel .
and the women her neighbours gave it a name , saying , There is a son born to Na@@ omi ; and they called his name O@@ bed : he is the father of Jes@@ se , the father of David .
now there was a certain man of Ram@@ ath@@ aim @@@ -@@ @ z@@ op@@ him , of mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and his name was El@@ kan@@ ah , the son of J@@ ero@@ ham , the son of Eli@@ hu , the son of to@@ hu , the son of Z@@ up@@ h , an E@@ ph@@ ra@@ th@@ ite :
and he had two wives ; the name of the one was Hann@@ ah , and the name of the other Pen@@ in@@ n@@ ah : and Pen@@ in@@ n@@ ah had children , but Hann@@ ah had no children .
and this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Sh@@ il@@ oh . and the two sons of El@@ i , Hop@@ hn@@ i and Ph@@ ine@@ has , the priests of the LORD , were there .
and as he did so year by year , when she went up to the house of the LORD , so she provoked her ; therefore she we@@ pt , and did not eat .
so Hann@@ ah rose up after they had eaten in Sh@@ il@@ oh , and after they had drunk . now El@@ i the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD .
and Hann@@ ah answered and said , No , my lord , I am a woman of a sor@@ row@@ ful spirit : I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink , but have poured out my soul before the LORD .
and the man El@@ kan@@ ah , and all his house , went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice , and his vo@@ w .
but Hann@@ ah went not up ; for she said unto her husband , I will not go up until the child be we@@ an@@ ed , and then I will bring him , that he may appear before the LORD , and there abide for ever .
and when she had we@@ an@@ ed him , she took him up with her , with three bul@@ locks , and one ep@@ ha@@ h of flour , and a bottle of wine , and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Sh@@ il@@ oh : and the child was young .
talk no more so exceeding proudly ; let not ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ cy come out of your mouth : for the LORD is a God of knowledge , and by him actions are weighed .
also before they burnt the fat , the priest 's servant came , and said to the man that sacrificed , Gi@@ ve flesh to ro@@ ast for the priest ; for he will not have so@@ dden flesh of thee , but raw .
moreover his mother made him a little coat , and brought it to him from year to year , when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice .
n@@ ay , my sons ; for it is no good report that I hear : ye make the LORD 's people to trans@@ gress .
and there came a man of God unto El@@ i , and said unto him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father , when they were in Egypt in Phar@@ aoh 's house ?
behold , the days come , that I will cut off th@@ ine arm , and the arm of thy father 's house , that there shall not be an old man in th@@ ine house .
and thou shalt see an enemy in my hab@@ itation , in all the wealth which God shall give Israel : and there shall not be an old man in th@@ ine house for ever .
and the man of th@@ ine , whom I shall not cut off from mine altar , shall be to consume th@@ ine eyes , and to gri@@ eve th@@ ine heart : and all the increase of th@@ ine house shall die in the flower of their age .
and this shall be a sign unto thee , that shall come upon thy two sons , on Hop@@ hn@@ i and Ph@@ ine@@ has ; in one day they shall die both of them .
and I will raise me up a faithful priest , that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind : and I will build him a sure house ; and he shall walk before mine ano@@ inted for ever .
and the child Samuel minist@@ ered unto the LORD before El@@ i . and the word of the LORD was precious in those days ; there was no open vision .
and the LORD called Samuel again the third time . and he arose and went to El@@ i , and said , Here am I ; for thou did@@ st call me . and El@@ i perceived that the LORD had called the child .
therefore El@@ i said unto Samuel , Go , lie down : and it shall be , if he call thee , that thou shalt say , Spe@@ ak , LORD ; for thy servant he@@ areth . so Samuel went and lay down in his place .
and the LORD said to Samuel , Be@@ hold , I will do a thing in Israel , at which both the ears of every one that he@@ areth it shall ting@@ le .
in that day I will perform against El@@ i all things which I have spoken concerning his house : when I begin , I will also make an end .
and therefore I have sworn unto the house of El@@ i , that the ini@@ qu@@ ity of El@@ i 's house shall not be pur@@ ged with sacrifice nor offering for ever .
and Samuel lay until the morning , and opened the doors of the house of the LORD . and Samuel feared to sh@@ ew El@@ i the vision .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines put themselves in array against Israel : and when they joined battle , Israel was sm@@ it@@ ten before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and they sle@@ w of the army in the field about four thousand men .
and when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp , all Israel shouted with a great shout , so that the earth rang again .
w@@ oe unto us ! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods ? these are the Gods that smo@@ te the Egyptians with all the pl@@ agues in the wilderness .
be strong , and quit yourselves like men , O ye Phil@@ ist@@ ines , that ye be not servants unto the He@@ bre@@ ws , as they have been to you : quit yourselves like men , and fight .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines fought , and Israel was sm@@ it@@ ten , and they fled every man into his tent : and there was a very great slaughter ; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot@@ men .
and when he came , lo , El@@ i sat upon a seat by the way@@ side watching : for his heart trem@@ bled for the ark of God . and when the man came into the city , and told it , all the city cried out .
and the man said unto El@@ i , I am he that came out of the army , and I fled to day out of the army . and he said , What is there done , my son ?
and the messenger answered and said , Israel is fled before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people , and thy two sons also , Hop@@ hn@@ i and Ph@@ ine@@ has , are dead , and the ark of God is taken .
and about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her , Fe@@ ar not ; for thou hast born a son . but she answered not , neither did she regard it .
and she named the child I @@@ -@@ @ ch@@ ab@@ od , saying , The glory is departed from Israel : because the ark of God was taken , and because of her father in law and her husband .
and when they of Ash@@ do@@ d arose early on the mor@@ row , behold , D@@ agon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD . and they took D@@ agon , and set him in his place again .
therefore neither the priests of D@@ agon , nor any that come into D@@ agon 's house , t@@ read on the threshold of D@@ agon in Ash@@ do@@ d unto this day .
but the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ash@@ do@@ d , and he destroyed them , and smo@@ te them with emer@@ ods , even Ash@@ do@@ d and the co@@ asts thereof .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines called for the priests and the div@@ in@@ ers , saying , What shall we do to the ark of the LORD ? tell us where@@ with we shall send it to his place .
then said they , What shall be the t@@ resp@@ ass offering which we shall return to him ? they answered , Five golden emer@@ ods , and five golden mice , according to the number of the lords of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : for one plague was on you all , and on your lords .
W@@ herefore ye shall make images of your emer@@ ods , and images of your mice that mar the land ; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel : per@@ adventure he will ligh@@ ten his hand from off you , and from off your gods , and from off your land .
and take the ark of the LORD , and lay it upon the cart ; and put the jew@@ els of gold , which ye return him for a t@@ resp@@ ass offering , in a coff@@ er by the side thereof ; and send it away , that it may go .
and when the five lords of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had seen it , they returned to Ek@@ ron the same day .
and the men of B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ Sh@@ em@@ esh said , Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God ? and to whom shall he go up from us ?
and it came to pass , while the ark ab@@ ode in Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im , that the time was long ; for it was twenty years : and all the house of Israel lam@@ ented after the LORD .
then the children of Israel did put away Ba@@ ali@@ m and Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th , and served the LORD only .
and they gathered together to M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h , and drew water , and poured it out before the LORD , and fast@@ ed on that day , and said there , We have sin@@ ned against the LORD . and Samuel judged the children of Israel in M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h .
and when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to M@@ iz@@ pe@@ h , the lords of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went up against Israel . and when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and the children of Israel said to Samuel , C@@ ease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us , that he will save us out of the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering , the Phil@@ ist@@ ines drew near to battle against Israel : but the LORD thunder@@ ed with a great thunder on that day upon the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and dis@@ com@@ f@@ ited them ; and they were sm@@ it@@ ten before Israel .
so the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were subdued , and they came no more into the coast of Israel : and the hand of the LORD was against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines all the days of Samuel .
and his return was to Ram@@ ah ; for there was his house ; and there he judged Israel ; and there he built an altar unto the LORD .
now the name of his fir@@ st@@ born was Jo@@ el ; and the name of his second , A@@ bi@@ ah : they were judges in Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba .
and the LORD said unto Samuel , hear@@ ken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee : for they have not rejected thee , but they have rejected me , that I should not reign over them .
according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day , where@@ with they have for@@ s@@ aken me , and served other gods , so do they also unto thee .
now therefore hear@@ ken unto their voice : How@@ be@@ it yet protest solem@@ nly unto them , and sh@@ ew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them .
and Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king .
and he said , This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them for himself , for his ch@@ ari@@ ots , and to be his hor@@ sem@@ en ; and some shall run before his ch@@ ari@@ ots .
and he will appoint him cap@@ tains over thousands , and cap@@ tains over fif@@ ties ; and will set them to ear his ground , and to reap his harvest , and to make his instruments of war , and instruments of his ch@@ ari@@ ots .
and he will take the tenth of your seed , and of your vineyards , and give to his officers , and to his servants .
and he will take your men@@ servants , and your mai@@ d@@ servants , and your good@@ li@@ est young men , and your asses , and put them to his work .
and ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you ; and the LORD will not hear you in that day .
nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel ; and they said , N@@ ay ; but we will have a king over us ;
that we also may be like all the nations ; and that our king may judge us , and go out before us , and fight our battles .
now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was K@@ ish , the son of A@@ bi@@ el , the son of Zer@@ or , the son of Bec@@ hor@@ ath , the son of Ap@@ hi@@ ah , a Ben@@ jam@@ ite , a mighty man of power .
and the asses of K@@ ish Saul 's father were lost . and K@@ ish said to Saul his son , Take now one of the servants with thee , and arise , go seek the asses .
and when they were come to the land of Z@@ up@@ h , Saul said to his servant that was with him , Come , and let us return ; lest my father leave caring for the asses , and take thought for us .
then said Saul to his servant , But , behold , if we go , what shall we bring the man ? for the bread is spent in our vessels , and there is not a present to bring to the man of God : what have we ?
then said Saul to his servant , Well said ; come , let us go . so they went unto the city where the man of God was .
and as they went up the hill to the city , they found young mai@@ dens going out to draw water , and said unto them , Is the se@@ er here ?
and they answered them , and said , He is ; behold , he is before you : make ha@@ ste now , for he came to day to the city ; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place :
and they went up into the city : and when they were come into the city , behold , Samuel came out against them , for to go up to the high place .
and when Samuel saw Saul , the LORD said unto him , Be@@ hold the man whom I sp@@ ake to thee of ! this same shall reign over my people .
then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate , and said , Tell me , I pray thee , where the se@@ er 's house is .
and Samuel answered Saul , and said , I am the se@@ er : go up before me unto the high place ; for ye shall eat with me to day , and to mor@@ row I will let thee go , and will tell thee all that is in th@@ ine heart .
and as for th@@ ine asses that were lost three days ago , set not thy mind on them ; for they are found . and on whom is all the desire of Israel ? is it not on thee , and on all thy father 's house ?
and Samuel took Saul and his servant , and brought them into the parl@@ our , and made them sit in the chief@@ est place among them that were bid@@ den , which were about thirty persons .
and they arose early : and it came to pass about the spring of the day , that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house , saying , Up , that I may send thee away . and Saul arose , and they went out both of them , he and Samuel , abroad .
then Samuel took a vial of oil , and poured it upon his head , and kis@@ sed him , and said , Is it not because the LORD hath ano@@ inted thee to be captain over his inheritance ?
then shalt thou go on forward from th@@ ence , and thou shalt come to the plain of Tab@@ or , and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Be@@ the@@ l , one carrying three kids , and another carrying three lo@@ aves of bread , and another carrying a bottle of wine :
and the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee , and thou shalt proph@@ esy with them , and shalt be turned into another man .
and let it be , when these signs are come unto thee , that thou do as occasion serve thee ; for God is with thee .
and thou shalt go down before me to Gil@@ gal ; and , behold , I will come down unto thee , to offer burnt offerings , and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings : seven days shalt thou tar@@ ry , till I come to thee , and sh@@ ew thee what thou shalt do .
and it was so , that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel , God gave him another heart : and all those signs came to pass that day .
and when they came thi@@ ther to the hill , behold , a company of prophets met him ; and the Spirit of God came upon him , and he prophe@@ si@@ ed among them .
and it came to pass , when all that knew him be@@ fore@@ time saw that , behold , he prophe@@ si@@ ed among the prophets , then the people said one to another , What is this that is come unto the son of K@@ ish ? is Saul also among the prophets ?
and Saul 's uncle said unto him and to his servant , whi@@ ther went ye ? and he said , To seek the asses : and when we saw that they were no where , we came to Samuel .
when he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families , the family of Mat@@ ri was taken , and Saul the son of K@@ ish was taken : and when they sought him , he could not be found .
therefore they inqui@@ red of the LORD further , if the man should yet come thi@@ ther . and the LORD answered , Be@@ hold , he hath hid himself among the stuff .
and they ran and fetched him th@@ ence : and when he stood among the people , he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward .
and Samuel said to all the people , See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen , that there is none like him among all the people ? and all the people shouted , and said , God save the king .
then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before the LORD . and Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
then N@@ ah@@ ash the Am@@ mon@@ ite came up , and enc@@ amped against Jab@@ esh @@@ -@@ @ Gil@@ e@@ ad : and all the men of Jab@@ esh said unto N@@ ah@@ ash , Make a covenant with us , and we will serve thee .
and N@@ ah@@ ash the Am@@ mon@@ ite answered them , On this condition will I make a covenant with you , that I may thrust out all your right eyes , and lay it for a repro@@ ach upon all Israel .
and the elders of Jab@@ esh said unto him , Gi@@ ve us seven days ' resp@@ ite , that we may send messengers unto all the co@@ asts of Israel : and then , if there be no man to save us , we will come out to thee .
and , behold , Saul came after the herd out of the field ; and Saul said , What ail@@ eth the people that they we@@ ep ? and they told him the ti@@ dings of the men of Jab@@ esh .
and when he numbered them in B@@ ez@@ ek , the children of Israel were three hundred thousand , and the men of Jud@@ ah thirty thousand .
therefore the men of Jab@@ esh said , To mor@@ row we will come out unto you , and ye shall do with us all that seem@@ eth good unto you .
and the people said unto Samuel , Who is he that said , Sh@@ all Saul reign over us ? bring the men , that we may put them to death .
and Saul said , There shall not a man be put to death this day : for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel .
and all the people went to Gil@@ gal ; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gil@@ gal ; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD ; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejo@@ iced greatly .
and now , behold , the king wal@@ ket@@ h before you : and I am old and gra@@ y@@ headed ; and , behold , my sons are with you : and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day .
and he said unto them , The LORD is witness against you , and his ano@@ inted is witness this day , that ye have not found ought in my hand . and they answered , He is witness .
and Samuel said unto the people , It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron , and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt .
now therefore stand still , that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD , which he did to you and to your fathers .
when Jacob was come into Egypt , and your fathers cried unto the LORD , then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron , which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt , and made them dwell in this place .
and when they for@@ g@@ at the LORD their God , he sold them into the hand of S@@ is@@ era , captain of the host of Haz@@ or , and into the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and into the hand of the king of Mo@@ ab , and they fought against them .
and they cried unto the LORD , and said , We have sin@@ ned , because we have for@@ s@@ aken the LORD , and have served Ba@@ ali@@ m and Ash@@ tar@@ o@@ th : but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies , and we will serve thee .
now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen , and whom ye have desired ! and , behold , the LORD hath set a king over you .
if ye will fear the LORD , and serve him , and obey his voice , and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD , then shall both ye and also the king that re@@ ig@@ neth over you continue following the LORD your God :
and all the people said unto Samuel , Pr@@ ay for thy servants unto the LORD thy God , that we die not : for we have added unto all our sins this evil , to ask us a king .
and Samuel said unto the people , Fe@@ ar not : ye have done all this w@@ ick@@ edness : yet turn not aside from following the LORD , but serve the LORD with all your heart ;
and turn ye not aside : for then should ye go after vain things , which C@@ AN@@ NOT profit nor deliver ; for they are vain .
for the LORD will not for@@ sake his people for his great name 's sake : because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people .
moreover as for me , God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in c@@ easing to pray for you : but I will teach you the good and the right way :
and Jonathan smo@@ te the gar@@ rison of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines that was in Ge@@ ba , and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard of it . and Saul blew the trum@@ pet throughout all the land , saying , Let the He@@ bre@@ ws hear .
and all Israel heard say that Saul had sm@@ it@@ ten a gar@@ rison of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and that Israel also was had in ab@@ om@@ ination with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines . and the people were called together after Saul to Gil@@ gal .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel , thirty thousand ch@@ ari@@ ots , and six thousand hor@@ sem@@ en , and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude : and they came up , and pit@@ ched in Mic@@ h@@ mash , eastward from B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ A@@ ven .
when the men of Israel saw that they were in a str@@ ait , ( for the people were distressed , ) then the people did hide themselves in caves , and in th@@ ic@@ kets , and in rocks , and in high places , and in pits .
and Samuel said , What hast thou done ? and Saul said , Because I saw that the people were scattered from me , and that thou cam@@ est not within the days appointed , and that the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered themselves together at Mic@@ h@@ mash ;
therefore said I , The Phil@@ ist@@ ines will come down now upon me to Gil@@ gal , and I have not made suppl@@ ication unto the LORD : I forced myself therefore , and offered a burnt offering .
and Samuel said to Saul , Th@@ ou hast done fool@@ ishly : thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God , which he commanded thee : for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever .
and Samuel arose , and G@@ at him up from Gil@@ gal unto Gi@@ be@@ ah of Benjamin . and Saul numbered the people that were present with him , about six hundred men .
and Saul , and Jonathan his son , and the people that were present with them , ab@@ ode in Gi@@ be@@ ah of Benjamin : but the Phil@@ ist@@ ines enc@@ amped in Mic@@ h@@ mash .
now there was no sm@@ ith found throughout all the land of Israel : for the Phil@@ ist@@ ines said , L@@ est the He@@ bre@@ ws make them s@@ words or spe@@ ars :
but all the Israel@@ ites went down to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , to shar@@ pen every man his share , and his cou@@ l@@ ter , and his ax@@ e , and his mat@@ to@@ ck .
so it came to pass in the day of battle , that there was neither sword nor spe@@ ar found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan : but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found .
and Saul tar@@ ried in the utter@@ most part of Gi@@ be@@ ah under a p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate tree which is in Mi@@ gr@@ on : and the people that were with him were about six hundred men ;
and A@@ hi@@ ah , the son of Ah@@ it@@ u@@ b , I @@@ -@@ @ ch@@ ab@@ od 's brother , the son of Ph@@ ine@@ has , the son of El@@ i , the LORD 's priest in Sh@@ il@@ oh , wearing an ep@@ ho@@ d . and the people knew not that Jonathan was gone .
but if they say thus , Come up unto us ; then we will go up : for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand : and this shall be a sign unto us .
and both of them discovered themselves unto the gar@@ rison of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines said , Be@@ hold , the He@@ bre@@ ws come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves .
and that first slaughter , which Jonathan and his arm@@ our@@ be@@ arer made , was about twenty men , within as it were an half acre of land , which a y@@ oke of ox@@ en might plo@@ w .
and there was trembling in the host , in the field , and among all the people : the gar@@ rison , and the spo@@ il@@ ers , they also trem@@ bled , and the earth qu@@ aked : so it was a very great trembling .
then said Saul unto the people that were with him , Number now , and see who is gone from us . and when they had numbered , behold , Jonathan and his arm@@ our@@ be@@ arer were not there .
and it came to pass , while Saul talked unto the priest , that the noise that was in the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines went on and increased : and Saul said unto the priest , With@@ draw th@@ ine hand .
and Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves , and they came to the battle : and , behold , every man 's sword was against his fellow , and there was a very great dis@@ com@@ fit@@ ure .
moreover the He@@ bre@@ ws that were with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines before that time , which went up with them into the camp from the country round about , even they also turned to be with the Israel@@ ites that were with Saul and Jonathan .
and the men of Israel were distressed that day : for Saul had adju@@ red the people , saying , Cur@@ sed be the man that e@@ at@@ eth any food until evening , that I may be av@@ eng@@ ed on mine enemies . so none of the people t@@ asted any food .
and when the people were come into the wood , behold , the honey dropped ; but no man put his hand to his mouth : for the people feared the oath .
but Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath : W@@ herefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand , and di@@ pped it in an honey@@ comb , and put his hand to his mouth ; and his eyes were enlightened .
then answered one of the people , and said , Th@@ y father stra@@ itly charged the people with an oath , saying , Cur@@ sed be the man that e@@ at@@ eth any food this day . and the people were faint .
then said Jonathan , My father hath troubled the land : see , I pray you , how mine eyes have been enlightened , because I t@@ asted a little of this honey .
and the people flew upon the spoil , and took sheep , and ox@@ en , and cal@@ ves , and sle@@ w them on the ground : and the people did eat them with the blood .
then they told Saul , saying , Be@@ hold , the people sin against the LORD , in that they eat with the blood . and he said , Y@@ e have trans@@ g@@ ressed : roll a great stone unto me this day .
and Saul built an altar unto the LORD : the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD .
and Saul said , D@@ raw ye near hi@@ ther , all the chief of the people : and know and see where@@ in this sin hath been this day .
and Saul answered , God do so and more also : for thou shalt surely die , Jonathan .
and he gathered an host , and smo@@ te the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them .
now the sons of Saul were Jonathan , and I@@ shu@@ i , and Mel@@ chi @@@ -@@ @ Sh@@ ua : and the names of his two daughters were these ; the name of the fir@@ st@@ born Mer@@ ab , and the name of the younger Mic@@ h@@ al :
and Saul said unto the Ken@@ ites , Go , depart , get you down from among the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites , lest I destroy you with them : for ye sh@@ ew@@ ed kindness to all the children of Israel , when they came up out of Egypt . so the Ken@@ ites departed from among the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites .
and Samuel came to Saul : and Saul said unto him , Bless@@ ed be thou of the LORD : I have performed the commandment of the LORD .
and Saul said , They have brought them from the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites : for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the ox@@ en , to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God ; and the rest we have utterly destroyed .
then Samuel said unto Saul , Stay , and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night . and he said unto him , S@@ ay on .
and Samuel said , When thou w@@ ast little in th@@ ine own sight , w@@ ast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel , and the LORD ano@@ inted thee king over Israel ?
but the people took of the spoil , sheep and ox@@ en , the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed , to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gil@@ gal .
and Saul said unto Samuel , I have sin@@ ned : for I have trans@@ g@@ ressed the commandment of the LORD , and thy words : because I feared the people , and obeyed their voice .
now therefore , I pray thee , pardon my sin , and turn again with me , that I may worship the LORD .
and as Samuel turned about to go away , he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle , and it rent .
then he said , I have sin@@ ned : yet honour me now , I pray thee , before the elders of my people , and before Israel , and turn again with me , that I may worship the LORD thy God .
then said Samuel , B@@ ring ye hi@@ ther to me Ag@@ ag the king of the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites . and Ag@@ ag came unto him delic@@ ately . and Ag@@ ag said , Su@@ rely the bitterness of death is past .
and Samuel said , How can I go ? if Saul hear it , he Will kill me . and the LORD said , Take an hei@@ fer with thee , and say , I am come to sacrifice to the LORD .
and he said , peace@@ ably : I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD : sancti@@ fy yourselves , and come with me to the sacrifice . and he sancti@@ fied Jes@@ se and his sons , and called them to the sacrifice .
and it came to pass , when they were come , that he looked on Eli@@ ab , and said , Su@@ rely the LORD 's ano@@ inted is before him .
but the LORD said unto Samuel , Look not on his coun@@ tenance , or on the height of his stature ; because I have refused him : for the LORD se@@ eth not as man se@@ eth ; for man loo@@ ket@@ h on the outward appearance , but the LORD loo@@ ket@@ h on the heart .
again , Jes@@ se made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel . and Samuel said unto Jes@@ se , The LORD hath not chosen these .
and he sent , and brought him in . now he was rud@@ dy , and with@@ al of a beautiful coun@@ tenance , and goo@@ dly to look to . and the LORD said , A@@ rise , ano@@ int him : for this is he .
then Samuel took the horn of oil , and ano@@ inted him in the midst of his brethren : and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward . so Samuel rose up , and went to Ram@@ ah .
and Saul sent to Jes@@ se , saying , Let David , I pray thee , stand before me ; for he hath found favour in my sight .
and it came to pass , when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul , that David took an har@@ p , and played with his hand : so Saul was refresh@@ ed , and was well , and the evil spirit departed from him .
now the Phil@@ ist@@ ines gathered together their armies to battle , and were gathered together at Sho@@ cho@@ h , which belong@@ eth to Jud@@ ah , and pit@@ ched between Sho@@ cho@@ h and A@@ ze@@ k@@ ah , in E@@ ph@@ es @@@ -@@ @ dam@@ mi@@ m .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines stood on a mountain on the one side , and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side : and there was a valley between them .
and there went out a champion out of the camp of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , named G@@ oli@@ ath , of G@@ ath , whose height was six cub@@ its and a span .
and he had an helmet of brass upon his head , and he was armed with a coat of mail ; and the weight of the coat was five thousand she@@ k@@ els of brass .
and he had gre@@ aves of brass upon his legs , and a target of brass between his shoulders .
and the staff of his spe@@ ar was like a we@@ aver 's beam ; and his spe@@ ar 's head weighed six hundred she@@ k@@ els of iron : and one bearing a shield went before him .
if he be able to fight with me , and to kill me , then will we be your servants : but if I prevail against him , and kill him , then shall ye be our servants , and serve us .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ine said , I defy the armies of Israel this day ; give me a man , that we may fight together .
now David was the son of that E@@ ph@@ ra@@ th@@ ite of Beth@@ le@@ hem@@ jud@@ ah , whose name was Jes@@ se ; and he had eight sons : and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul .
and the three el@@ dest sons of Jes@@ se went and followed Saul to the battle : and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eli@@ ab the fir@@ st@@ born , and next unto him Ab@@ in@@ ad@@ ab , and the third Sham@@ ma@@ h .
and Jes@@ se said unto David his son , Take now for thy brethren an ep@@ ha@@ h of this par@@ ched corn , and these ten lo@@ aves , and run to the camp to thy brethren ;
and carry these ten che@@ eses unto the captain of their thousand , and look how thy brethren fare , and take their pledge .
and David rose up early in the morning , and left the sheep with a keeper , and took , and went , as Jes@@ se had commanded him ; and he came to the t@@ rench , as the host was going forth to the fight , and shouted for the battle .
and David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage , and ran into the army , and came and sal@@ uted his brethren .
and as he talked with them , behold , there came up the champion , the Phil@@ ist@@ ine of G@@ ath , G@@ oli@@ ath by name , out of the armies of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and sp@@ ake according to the same words : and David heard them .
and David sp@@ ake to the men that stood by him , saying , What shall be done to the man that kill@@ eth this Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and tak@@ eth away the repro@@ ach from Israel ? for who is this un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised Phil@@ ist@@ ine , that he should defy the armies of the living God ?
and he turned from him toward another , and sp@@ ake after the same manner : and the people answered him again after the former manner .
and Saul said to David , Th@@ ou art not able to go against this Phil@@ ist@@ ine to fight with him : for thou art but a youth , and he a man of war from his youth .
and David said unto Saul , Th@@ y servant kept his father 's sheep , and there came a lion , and a bear , and took a lamb out of the flock :
and I went out after him , and smo@@ te him , and delivered it out of his mouth : and when he arose against me , I caught him by his beard , and smo@@ te him , and sle@@ w him .
David said moreover , The LORD that delivered me out of the pa@@ w of the lion , and out of the pa@@ w of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Phil@@ ist@@ ine . and Saul said unto David , Go , and the LORD be with thee .
and Saul armed David with his arm@@ our , and he put an helmet of brass upon his head ; also he armed him with a coat of mail .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ine came on and drew near unto David ; and the man that bare the shield went before him .
and when the Phil@@ ist@@ ine looked about , and saw David , he disd@@ ained him : for he was but a youth , and rud@@ dy , and of a fair coun@@ tenance .
and all this assembly shall know that the LORD sav@@ eth not with sword and spe@@ ar : for the battle is the LORD 's , and he will give you into our hands .
and David put his hand in his bag , and took th@@ ence a stone , and slan@@ g it , and smo@@ te the Phil@@ ist@@ ine in his forehead , that the stone sunk into his forehead ; and he fell upon his face to the earth .
so David prevailed over the Phil@@ ist@@ ine with a s@@ ling and with a stone , and smo@@ te the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and sle@@ w him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
therefore David ran , and stood upon the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , and took his sword , and drew it out of the she@@ ath thereof , and sle@@ w him , and cut off his head there@@ with . and when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines saw their champion was dead , they fled .
and when Saul saw David go forth against the Phil@@ ist@@ ine , he said unto Ab@@ ner , the captain of the host , Ab@@ ner , whose son is this youth ? and Ab@@ ner said , As thy soul liv@@ eth , O king , I C@@ AN@@ NOT tell .
and Saul said to him , Wh@@ ose son art thou , thou young man ? and David answered , I am the son of thy servant Jes@@ se the Beth@@ le@@ hem@@ ite .
and the women answered one another as they played , and said , Saul hath sl@@ ain his thousands , and David his ten thousands .
and Saul was very w@@ ro@@ th , and the saying dis@@ pleased him ; and he said , They have ascri@@ bed unto David ten thousands , and to me they have ascri@@ bed but thousands : and what can he have more but the kingdom ?
therefore Saul removed him from him , and made him his captain over a thousand ; and he went out and came in before the people .
and David said unto Saul , Who am I ? and what is my life , or my father 's family in Israel , that I should be son in law to the king ?
but it came to pass at the time when Mer@@ ab Saul 's daughter should have been given to David , that she was given unto Adri@@ el the Me@@ hol@@ ath@@ ite to wife .
and Saul commanded his servants , saying , Commun@@ e with David secretly , and say , Be@@ hold , the king hath delight in thee , and all his servants love thee : now therefore be the king 's son in law .
and Saul 's servants sp@@ ake those words in the ears of David . and David said , seem@@ eth it to you a light thing to be a king 's son in law , seeing that I am a poor man , and lightly este@@ em@@ ed ?
and Saul said , Th@@ us shall ye say to David , The king desi@@ re@@ th not any d@@ ow@@ ry , but an hundred fores@@ kins of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , to be av@@ eng@@ ed of the king 's enemies . but Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and Saul sp@@ ake to Jonathan his son , and to all his servants , that they should kill David .
and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art , and I will commun@@ e with my father of thee ; and what I see , that I will tell thee .
and Jonathan sp@@ ake good of David unto Saul his father , and said unto him , Let not the king sin against his servant , against David ; because he hath not sin@@ ned against thee , and because his works have been to the@@ ew@@ ard very good :
and Saul hear@@ k@@ ened unto the voice of Jonathan : and Saul sw@@ are , As the LORD liv@@ eth , he shall not be sl@@ ain .
and there was war again : and David went out , and fought with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and sle@@ w them with a great slaughter ; and they fled from him .
and Saul sought to sm@@ ite David even to the wall with the javelin ; but he slipped away out of Saul 's presence , and he smo@@ te the javelin into the wall : and David fled , and escaped that night .
Saul also sent messengers unto David 's house , to watch him , and to sl@@ ay him in the morning : and Mic@@ h@@ al David 's wife told him , saying , If thou save not thy life to night , to mor@@ row thou shalt be sl@@ ain .
and Saul said unto Mic@@ h@@ al , Why hast thou deceived me so , and sent away mine enemy , that he is escaped ? and Mic@@ h@@ al answered Saul , He said unto me , Let me go ; why should I kill thee ?
and Saul sent messengers to take David : and when they saw the company of the prophets proph@@ es@@ ying , and Samuel standing as appointed over them , the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul , and they also prophe@@ si@@ ed .
then went he also to Ram@@ ah , and came to a great well that is in Sec@@ hu : and he asked and said , Where are Samuel and David ? and one said , Be@@ hold , they be at Nai@@ o@@ th in Ram@@ ah .
and he stripped off his clothes also , and prophe@@ si@@ ed before Samuel in like manner , and lay down naked all that day and all that night . W@@ herefore they say , Is Saul also among the prophets ?
and David fled from Nai@@ o@@ th in Ram@@ ah , and came and said before Jonathan , What have I done ? what is mine ini@@ qu@@ ity ? and what is my sin before thy father , that he see@@ ket@@ h my life ?
and David said unto Jonathan , Be@@ hold , to mor@@ row is the new moon , and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat : but let me go , that I may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even .
if thy father at all miss me , then say , David ear@@ ne@@ stly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city : for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family .
and thou shalt not only while yet I live sh@@ ew me the kindness of the LORD , that I die not :
but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever : no , not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth .
and Jonathan caused David to swear again , because he loved him : for he loved him as he loved his own soul .
but if I say thus unto the young man , Be@@ hold , the arrows are beyond thee ; go thy way : for the LORD hath sent thee away .
and the king sat upon his seat , as at other times , even upon a seat by the wall : and Jonathan arose , and Ab@@ ner sat by Saul 's side , and David 's place was empty .
nevertheless Saul sp@@ ake not any thing that day : for he thought , Some@@ thing hath be@@ fallen him , he is not clean ; surely he is not clean .
then Saul 's anger was kind@@ led against Jonathan , and he said unto him , Th@@ ou son of the perverse rebelli@@ ous woman , do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jes@@ se to th@@ ine own confusion , and unto the confusion of thy mother 's n@@ ak@@ edness ?
so Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger , and did eat no meat the second day of the month : for he was griev@@ ed for David , because his father had done him shame .
and it came to pass in the morning , that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David , and a little l@@ ad with him .
and when the l@@ ad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot , Jonathan cried after the l@@ ad , and said , Is not the arrow beyond thee ?
and Jonathan cried after the l@@ ad , Make speed , ha@@ ste , stay not . and Jonathan 's l@@ ad gathered up the arrows , and came to his master .
and as soon as the l@@ ad was gone , David arose out of a place toward the south , and fell on his face to the ground , and bowed himself three times : and they kis@@ sed one another , and we@@ pt one with another , until David exceeded .
then came David to No@@ b to A@@ him@@ elec@@ h the priest : and A@@ him@@ elec@@ h was afraid at the meeting of David , and said unto him , Why art thou alone , and no man with thee ?
and the priest answered David , and said , There is no common bread under mine hand , but there is hal@@ lowed bread ; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women .
so the priest gave him hal@@ lowed bread : for there was no bread there but the sh@@ ew@@ bread , that was taken from before the LORD , to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away .
and the servants of Ach@@ ish said unto him , Is not this David the king of the land ? did they not sing one to another of him in dances , saying , Saul hath sl@@ ain his thousands , and David his ten thousands ?
and David laid up these words in his heart , and was sore afraid of Ach@@ ish the king of G@@ ath .
and he changed his behaviour before them , and fe@@ igned himself mad in their hands , and sc@@ rab@@ bled on the doors of the gate , and let his sp@@ ittle fall down upon his beard .
have I need of mad men , that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence ? shall this fellow come into my house ?
David therefore departed th@@ ence , and escaped to the cave Ad@@ ul@@ lam : and when his brethren and all his father 's house heard it , they went down thi@@ ther to him .
and the prophet G@@ ad said unto David , A@@ bi@@ de not in the hold ; depart , and get thee into the land of Jud@@ ah . then David departed , and came into the forest of H@@ areth .
then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him , He@@ ar now , ye Ben@@ jam@@ ites ; will the son of Jes@@ se give every one of you fields and vineyards , and make you all cap@@ tains of thousands , and cap@@ tains of hundreds ;
then answered Do@@ eg the E@@ dom@@ ite , which was set over the servants of Saul , and said , I saw the son of Jes@@ se coming to No@@ b , to A@@ him@@ elec@@ h the son of Ah@@ it@@ u@@ b .
then the king sent to call A@@ him@@ elec@@ h the priest , the son of Ah@@ it@@ u@@ b , and all his father 's house , the priests that were in No@@ b : and they came all of them to the king .
then A@@ him@@ elec@@ h answered the king , and said , And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David , which is the king 's son in law , and go@@ eth at thy bidding , and is hon@@ our@@ able in th@@ ine house ?
and the king said to Do@@ eg , Turn thou , and fall upon the priests . and Do@@ eg the E@@ dom@@ ite turned , and he fell upon the priests , and sle@@ w on that day four@@ score and five persons that did wear a linen ep@@ ho@@ d .
and David said unto A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar , I knew it that day , when Do@@ eg the E@@ dom@@ ite was there , that he would surely tell Saul : I have occa@@ sioned the death of all the persons of thy father 's house .
and David 's men said unto him , Be@@ hold , we be afraid here in Jud@@ ah : how much more then if we come to Ke@@ il@@ ah against the armies of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ?
then David inqui@@ red of the LORD yet again . and the LORD answered him and said , A@@ rise , go down to Ke@@ il@@ ah ; for I will deliver the Phil@@ ist@@ ines into th@@ ine hand .
so David and his men went to Ke@@ il@@ ah , and fought with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and brought away their cattle , and smo@@ te them with a great slaughter . so David saved the inhabitants of Ke@@ il@@ ah .
and it was told Saul that David was come to Ke@@ il@@ ah . and Saul said , God hath delivered him into mine hand ; for he is shut in , by entering into a town that hath gates and bars .
then said David , O LORD God of Israel , thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul see@@ ket@@ h to come to Ke@@ il@@ ah , to destroy the city for my sake .
will the men of Ke@@ il@@ ah deliver me up into his hand ? will Saul come down , as thy servant hath heard ? O LORD God of Israel , I bes@@ e@@ ech thee , tell thy servant . and the LORD said , He will come down .
then said David , Will the men of Ke@@ il@@ ah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul ? and the LORD said , They will deliver thee up .
then David and his men , which were about six hundred , arose and departed out of Ke@@ il@@ ah , and went whi@@ ther@@ soever they could go . and it was told Saul that David was escaped from Ke@@ il@@ ah ; and he for@@ bare to go forth .
and David ab@@ ode in the wilderness in strong holds , and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Zi@@ ph . and Saul sought him every day , but God delivered him not into his hand .
and he said unto him , Fe@@ ar not : for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee ; and thou shalt be king over Israel , and I shall be next unto thee ; and that also Saul my father know@@ eth .
then came up the Zi@@ ph@@ ites to Saul to Gi@@ be@@ ah , saying , do@@ th not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood , in the hill of H@@ ach@@ il@@ ah , which is on the south of Jes@@ him@@ on ?
go , I pray you , prepare yet , and know and see his place where his ha@@ unt is , and who hath seen him there : for it is told me that he deal@@ eth very sub@@ til@@ ly .
and they arose , and went to Zi@@ ph before Saul : but David and his men were in the wilderness of Ma@@ on , in the plain on the south of Jes@@ him@@ on .
Saul also and his men went to seek him . and they told David : W@@ herefore he came down into a rock , and ab@@ ode in the wilderness of Ma@@ on . and when Saul heard that , he pursued after David in the wilderness of Ma@@ on .
but there came a messenger unto Saul , saying , ha@@ ste thee , and come ; for the Phil@@ ist@@ ines have invaded the land .
and it came to pass , when Saul was returned from following the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , that it was told him , saying , Be@@ hold , David is in the wilderness of E@@ n @@@ -@@ @ G@@ ed@@ i .
and David said to Saul , W@@ herefore he@@ arest thou men 's words , saying , Be@@ hold , David see@@ ket@@ h thy hurt ?
and it came to pass , when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul , that Saul said , Is this thy voice , my son David ? and Saul lifted up his voice , and we@@ pt .
swear now therefore unto me by the LORD , that thou wil@@ t not cut off my seed after me , and that thou wil@@ t not destroy my name out of my father 's house .
and Samuel died ; and all the Israel@@ ites were gathered together , and lam@@ ented him , and buried him in his house at Ram@@ ah . and David arose , and went down to the wilderness of Par@@ an .
and there was a man in Ma@@ on , whose possessions were in Car@@ me@@ l ; and the man was very great , and he had three thousand sheep , and a thousand goats : and he was sh@@ earing his sheep in Car@@ me@@ l .
now the name of the man was Nab@@ al ; and the name of his wife Ab@@ ig@@ ail : and she was a woman of good understanding , and of a beautiful coun@@ tenance : but the man was chur@@ lish and evil in his do@@ ings ; and he was of the house of Cal@@ eb .
and David sent out ten young men , and David said unto the young men , Get you up to Car@@ me@@ l , and go to Nab@@ al , and greet him in my name :
and Nab@@ al answered David 's servants , and said , Who is David ? and who is the son of Jes@@ se ? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master .
and David said unto his men , G@@ ird ye on every man his sword . and they gir@@ ded on every man his sword ; and David also gir@@ ded on his sword : and there went up after David about four hundred men ; and two hundred ab@@ ode by the stuff .
but the men were very good unto us , and we were not hurt , neither missed we any thing , as long as we were convers@@ ant with them , when we were in the fields :
now therefore know and consider what thou wil@@ t do ; for evil is determined against our master , and against all his household : for he is such a son of Beli@@ al , that a man C@@ AN@@ NOT speak to him .
then Ab@@ ig@@ ail made ha@@ ste , and took two hundred lo@@ aves , and two bottles of wine , and five sheep ready dressed , and five measures of par@@ ched corn , and an hundred clusters of ra@@ is@@ ins , and two hundred cakes of fi@@ gs , and laid them on asses .
and it was so , as she rode on the ass , that she came down by the covert of the hill , and , behold , David and his men came down against her ; and she met them .
now David had said , Su@@ rely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness , so that nothing was missed of all that per@@ tained unto him : and he hath requ@@ ited me evil for good .
and when Ab@@ ig@@ ail saw David , she ha@@ sted , and lighted off the ass , and fell before David on her face , and bowed herself to the ground ,
and now this blessing which th@@ ine hand@@ maid hath brought unto my lord , let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord .
I pray thee , forgive the t@@ resp@@ ass of th@@ ine hand@@ maid : for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house ; because my lord fi@@ ght@@ eth the battles of the LORD , and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days .
and David said to Ab@@ ig@@ ail , Bless@@ ed be the LORD God of Israel , which sent thee this day to meet me :
and blessed be thy advice , and blessed be thou , which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood , and from av@@ eng@@ ing myself with mine own hand .
so David received of her hand that which she had brought him , and said unto her , Go up in peace to th@@ ine house ; see , I have hear@@ k@@ ened to thy voice , and have accepted thy person .
but it came to pass in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nab@@ al , and his wife had told him these things , that his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
and when the servants of David were come to Ab@@ ig@@ ail to Car@@ me@@ l , they sp@@ ake unto her , saying , David sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife .
and she arose , and bowed herself on her face to the earth , and said , Be@@ hold , let th@@ ine hand@@ maid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord .
and Ab@@ ig@@ ail ha@@ sted , and arose , and rode upon an ass , with five dam@@ sels of hers that went after her ; and she went after the messengers of David , and became his wife .
then Saul arose , and went down to the wilderness of Zi@@ ph , having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him , to seek David in the wilderness of Zi@@ ph .
and Saul pit@@ ched in the hill of H@@ ach@@ il@@ ah , which is before Jes@@ him@@ on , by the way . but David ab@@ ode in the wilderness , and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness .
and David arose , and came to the place where Saul had pit@@ ched : and David be@@ held the place where Saul lay , and Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , the captain of his host : and Saul lay in the t@@ rench , and the people pit@@ ched round about him .
then answered David and said to A@@ him@@ elec@@ h the Hit@@ tite , and to Ab@@ is@@ hai the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , brother to Jo@@ ab , saying , Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp ? and Ab@@ is@@ hai said , I will go down with thee .
so David and Ab@@ is@@ hai came to the people by night : and , behold , Saul lay sleeping within the t@@ rench , and his spe@@ ar stuck in the ground at his bolster : but Ab@@ ner and the people lay round about him .
and David said to Ab@@ is@@ hai , D@@ estro@@ y him not : for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD 's ano@@ inted , and be guil@@ tless ?
then David went over to the other side , and stood on the top of an hill af@@ ar off ; a great space being between them :
and David cried to the people , and to Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , saying , Answ@@ er@@ est thou not , Ab@@ ner ? then Ab@@ ner answered and said , Who art thou that cri@@ est to the king ?
and David said to Ab@@ ner , Art not thou a val@@ i@@ ant man ? and who is like to thee in Israel ? W@@ herefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king ? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord .
this thing is not good that thou hast done . as the LORD liv@@ eth , ye are worthy to die , because ye have not kept your master , the LORD 's ano@@ inted . and now see where the king 's spe@@ ar is , and the cr@@ use of water that was at his bolster .
and he said , W@@ herefore do@@ th my lord thus pursue after his servant ? for what have I done ? or what evil is in mine hand ?
and David answered and said , Be@@ hold the king 's spe@@ ar ! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it .
and , behold , as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes , so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD , and let him deliver me out of all tribu@@ lation .
then Saul said to David , Bless@@ ed be thou , my son David : thou shalt both do great things , and also shalt still prevail . so David went on his way , and Saul returned to his place .
and David arose , and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Ach@@ ish , the son of Ma@@ o@@ ch , king of G@@ ath .
and Ach@@ ish said , whi@@ ther have ye made a road to day ? and David said , Against the south of Jud@@ ah , and against the south of the Jer@@ ah@@ me@@ elites , and against the south of the Ken@@ ites .
and Ach@@ ish believed David , saying , He hath made his people Israel utterly to abh@@ or him ; therefore he shall be my servant for ever .
and Saul sw@@ are to her by the LORD , saying , As the LORD liv@@ eth , there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing .
and when the woman saw Samuel , she cried with a loud voice : and the woman sp@@ ake to Saul , saying , Why hast thou deceived me ? for thou art Saul .
and the king said unto her , Be not afraid : for what saw@@ est thou ? and the woman said unto Saul , I saw gods asc@@ ending out of the earth .
then Saul fell strai@@ gh@@ tw@@ ay all along on the earth , and was sore afraid , because of the words of Samuel : and there was no strength in him ; for he had eaten no bread all the day , nor all the night .
but he refused , and said , I will not eat . but his servants , together with the woman , compelled him ; and he hear@@ k@@ ened unto their voice . so he arose from the earth , and sat upon the bed .
and the woman had a fat cal@@ f in the house ; and she ha@@ sted , and killed it , and took flour , and kne@@ aded it , and did b@@ ake un@@ leav@@ ened bread thereof :
and she brought it before Saul , and before his servants ; and they did eat . then they rose up , and went away that night .
and Ach@@ ish answered and said to David , I know that thou art good in my sight , as an angel of God : notwithstanding the princes of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines have said , He shall not go up with us to the battle .
W@@ herefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master 's servants that are come with thee : and as soon as ye be up early in the morning , and have light , depart .
and it came to pass , when David and his men were come to Z@@ ik@@ lag on the third day , that the A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ites had invaded the south , and Z@@ ik@@ lag , and sm@@ it@@ ten Z@@ ik@@ lag , and burned it with fire ;
so David and his men came to the city , and , behold , it was burned with fire ; and their wives , and their sons , and their daughters , were taken cap@@ tives .
and David inqui@@ red at the LORD , saying , Sh@@ all I pursue after this troop ? shall I over@@ take them ? and he answered him , Pur@@ sue : for thou shalt surely over@@ take them , and without fail recover all .
so David went , he and the six hundred men that were with him , and came to the bro@@ ok Bes@@ or , where those that were left behind stayed .
but David pursued , he and four hundred men : for two hundred ab@@ ode behind , which were so faint that they could not go over the bro@@ ok Bes@@ or .
and David said unto him , To whom belong@@ est thou ? and wh@@ ence art thou ? and he said , I am a young man of Egypt , servant to an A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ite ; and my master left me , because three days A@@ gone I fell sick .
and David said to him , can@@ st thou bring me down to this company ? and he said , swear unto me by God , that thou wil@@ t neither kill me , nor deliver me into the hands of my master , and I will bring thee down to this company .
and David smo@@ te them from the tw@@ ilight even unto the evening of the next day : and there escaped not a man of them , save four hundred young men , which rode upon cam@@ els , and fled .
then said David , Y@@ e shall not do so , my brethren , with that which the LORD hath given us , who hath preserved us , and delivered the company that came against us into our hand .
for who will hear@@ ken unto you in this matter ? but as his part is that go@@ eth down to the battle , so shall his part be that tar@@ ri@@ eth by the stuff : they shall part alike .
and when David came to Z@@ ik@@ lag , he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Jud@@ ah , even to his friends , saying , Be@@ hold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD ;
and to them which were in He@@ br@@ on , and to all the places where David himself and his men were won@@ t to ha@@ unt .
now the Phil@@ ist@@ ines fought against Israel : and the men of Israel fled from before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and fell down sl@@ ain in mount Gil@@ bo@@ a .
and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons ; and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines sle@@ w Jonathan , and Ab@@ in@@ ad@@ ab , and Mal@@ chi @@@ -@@ @ Sh@@ ua , Saul 's sons .
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came to strip the sl@@ ain , that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gil@@ bo@@ a .
and they cut off his head , and stripped off his arm@@ our , and sent into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines round about , to publish it in the house of their idols , and among the people .
all the val@@ i@@ ant men arose , and went all night , and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ Sh@@ an , and came to Jab@@ esh , and burnt them there .
and David said unto him , From wh@@ ence com@@ est thou ? and he said unto him , Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped .
and the young man that told him said , As I happened by chance upon mount Gil@@ bo@@ a , behold , Saul leaned upon his spe@@ ar ; and , lo , the ch@@ ari@@ ots and hor@@ sem@@ en followed hard after him .
and he said unto me again , Stand , I pray thee , upon me , and sl@@ ay me : for angu@@ ish is come upon me , because my life is yet whole in me .
and they mour@@ ned , and we@@ pt , and fast@@ ed until even , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of the LORD , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
and David said unto the young man that told him , wh@@ ence art thou ? and he answered , I am the son of a stranger , an A@@ mal@@ ek@@ ite .
and David said unto him , How w@@ ast thou not afraid to stretch forth th@@ ine hand to destroy the LORD 's ano@@ inted ?
tell it not in G@@ ath , publish it not in the streets of A@@ skel@@ on ; lest the daughters of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines rejoice , lest the daughters of the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised triumph .
Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives , and in their death they were not divided : they were swif@@ ter than eag@@ les , they were stronger than lions .
ye daughters of Israel , we@@ ep over Saul , who clo@@ thed you in scar@@ let , with other deli@@ ghts , who put on ornam@@ ents of gold upon your app@@ arel .
I am distressed for thee , my brother Jonathan : very pleasant hast thou been unto me : thy love to me was wonderful , passing the love of women .
and it came to pass after this , that David inqui@@ red of the LORD , saying , Sh@@ all I go up into any of the cities of Jud@@ ah ? and the LORD said unto him , Go up . and David said , whi@@ ther shall I go up ? and he said , Un@@ to He@@ br@@ on .
and his men that were with him did David bring up , every man with his household : and they d@@ wel@@ t in the cities of He@@ br@@ on .
and David sent messengers unto the men of Jab@@ esh @@@ -@@ @ Gil@@ e@@ ad , and said unto them , Bless@@ ed be ye of the LORD , that ye have sh@@ ew@@ ed this kindness unto your lord , even unto Saul , and have buried him .
therefore now let your hands be strengthened , and be ye val@@ i@@ ant : for your master Saul is dead , and also the house of Jud@@ ah have ano@@ inted me king over them .
but Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , captain of Saul 's host , took Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ bos@@ h@@ eth the son of Saul , and brought him over to Ma@@ han@@ aim ;
and Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , and the servants of Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ bos@@ h@@ eth the son of Saul , went out from Ma@@ han@@ aim to Gi@@ be@@ on .
and they caught every one his fellow by the head , and thrust his sword in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : W@@ herefore that place was called Hel@@ k@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ haz@@ z@@ ur@@ im , which is in Gi@@ be@@ on .
and there was a very sore battle that day ; and Ab@@ ner was beaten , and the men of Israel , before the servants of David .
Jo@@ ab also and Ab@@ is@@ hai pursued after Ab@@ ner : and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Am@@ ma@@ h , that li@@ eth before Gi@@ ah by the way of the wilderness of Gi@@ be@@ on .
and Jo@@ ab said , As God liv@@ eth , unless thou had@@ st spoken , surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother .
so Jo@@ ab blew a trum@@ pet , and all the people stood still , and pursued after Israel no more , neither fought they any more .
and Ab@@ ner and his men walked all that night through the plain , and passed over Jordan , and went through all Bi@@ thr@@ on , and they came to Ma@@ han@@ aim .
and Jo@@ ab returned from following Ab@@ ner : and when he had gathered all the people together , there lacked of David 's servants ninet@@ een men and As@@ ah@@ el .
and they took up As@@ ah@@ el , and buried him in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of his father , which was in Bethlehem . and Jo@@ ab and his men went all night , and they came to He@@ br@@ on at break of day .
now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David : but David wa@@ xed stronger and stronger , and the house of Saul wa@@ xed weaker and weaker .
and the fourth , Ad@@ oni@@ jah the son of H@@ agg@@ ith ; and the fifth , Sh@@ eph@@ ati@@ ah the son of Ab@@ ital ;
and Saul had a conc@@ ub@@ ine , whose name was R@@ iz@@ pa@@ h , the daughter of Ai@@ ah : and Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ bos@@ h@@ eth said to Ab@@ ner , W@@ herefore hast thou gone in unto my father 's conc@@ ub@@ ine ?
and Ab@@ ner sent messengers to David on his behalf , saying , Wh@@ ose is the land ? saying also , Make thy league with me , and , behold , my hand shall be with thee , to bring about all Israel unto thee .
and David sent messengers to Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ bos@@ h@@ eth Saul 's son , saying , Deli@@ ver me my wife Mic@@ h@@ al , which I esp@@ oused to me for an hundred fores@@ kins of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ bos@@ h@@ eth sent , and took her from her husband , even from P@@ hal@@ ti@@ el the son of La@@ ish .
and , Be@@ hold , the servants of David and Jo@@ ab came from pursuing a troop , and brought in a great spoil with them : but Ab@@ ner was not with David in He@@ br@@ on ; for he had sent him away , and he was gone in peace .
when Jo@@ ab and all the host that was with him were come , they told Jo@@ ab , saying , Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er came to the king , and he hath sent him away , and he is gone in peace .
then Jo@@ ab came to the king , and said , What hast thou done ? behold , Ab@@ ner came unto thee ; why is it that thou hast sent him away , and he is quite gone ?
thou know@@ est Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , that he came to deceive thee , and to know thy going out and thy coming in , and to know all that thou do@@ est .
and afterward when David heard it , he said , I and my kingdom are guil@@ tless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er :
and David said to Jo@@ ab , and to all the people that were with him , ren@@ d your clothes , and gir@@ d you with s@@ ack@@ cloth , and mour@@ n before Ab@@ ner . and king David himself followed the bi@@ er .
and I am this day weak , though ano@@ inted king ; and these men the sons of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah be too hard for me : the LORD shall reward the do@@ er of evil according to his w@@ ick@@ edness .
and Saul 's son had two men that were cap@@ tains of bands : the name of the one was Ba@@ an@@ ah , and the name of the other Rec@@ hab , the sons of Rim@@ mon a Be@@ ero@@ th@@ ite , of the children of Benjamin : ( for Be@@ ero@@ th also was reck@@ oned to Benjamin :
and the sons of Rim@@ mon the Be@@ ero@@ th@@ ite , Rec@@ hab and Ba@@ an@@ ah , went , and came about the heat of the day to the house of Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ bos@@ h@@ eth , who lay on a bed at noon .
and they came thi@@ ther into the midst of the house , as though they would have fetched wheat ; and they smo@@ te him under the fifth ri@@ b : and Rec@@ hab and Ba@@ an@@ ah his brother escaped .
and they brought the head of Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ bos@@ h@@ eth unto David to He@@ br@@ on , and said to the king , Be@@ hold the head of Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ bos@@ h@@ eth the son of Saul th@@ ine enemy , which sought thy life ; and the LORD hath av@@ eng@@ ed my lord the king this day of Saul , and of his seed .
and David answered Rec@@ hab and Ba@@ an@@ ah his brother , the sons of Rim@@ mon the Be@@ ero@@ th@@ ite , and said unto them , As the LORD liv@@ eth , who hath re@@ deemed my soul out of all ad@@ versity ,
how much more , when wicked men have sl@@ ain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed ? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand , and take you away from the earth ?
and David commanded his young men , and they sle@@ w them , and cut off their hands and their feet , and han@@ ged them up over the pool in He@@ br@@ on . but they took the head of Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ bos@@ h@@ eth , and buried it in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of Ab@@ ner in He@@ br@@ on .
then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto He@@ br@@ on , and sp@@ ake , saying , Be@@ hold , we are thy bone and thy flesh .
also in time past , when Saul was king over us , thou w@@ ast he that le@@ dd@@ est out and br@@ ough@@ test in Israel : and the LORD said to thee , Th@@ ou shalt feed my people Israel , and thou shalt be a captain over Israel .
so all the elders of Israel came to the king to He@@ br@@ on ; and king David made a league with them in He@@ br@@ on before the LORD : and they ano@@ inted David king over Israel .
so David d@@ wel@@ t in the fort , and called it the city of David . and David built round about from Mill@@ o and inward .
and David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel , and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel 's sake .
but when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines heard that they had ano@@ inted David king over Israel , all the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came up to seek David ; and David heard of it , and went down to the hold .
and David inqui@@ red of the LORD , saying , Sh@@ all I go up to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ? wil@@ t thou deliver them into mine hand ? and the LORD said unto David , Go up : for I will doub@@ tless deliver the Phil@@ ist@@ ines into th@@ ine hand .
and David came to Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ per@@ az@@ im , and David smo@@ te them there , and said , The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me , as the breach of waters . therefore he called the name of that place Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ per@@ az@@ im .
and David arose , and went with all the people that were with him from Ba@@ ale of Jud@@ ah , to bring up from th@@ ence the ark of God , whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwell@@ eth between the cher@@ ub@@ ims .
and they set the ark of God upon a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Ab@@ in@@ ad@@ ab that was in Gi@@ be@@ ah : and Uz@@ z@@ ah and A@@ hio , the sons of Ab@@ in@@ ad@@ ab , dra@@ ve the new cart .
and David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of f@@ ir wood , even on har@@ ps , and on p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies , and on tim@@ b@@ rels , and on cor@@ nets , and on cy@@ mb@@ als .
and when they came to N@@ ach@@ on 's thresh@@ ing@@ floor , Uz@@ z@@ ah put forth his hand to the ark of God , and took hold of it ; for the ox@@ en shook it .
and the anger of the LORD was kind@@ led against Uz@@ z@@ ah ; and God smo@@ te him there for his error ; and there he died by the ark of God .
and David was dis@@ pleased , because the LORD had made a breach upon Uz@@ z@@ ah : and he called the name of the place Per@@ ez @@@ -@@ @ uzz@@ ah to this day .
and David was afraid of the LORD that day , and said , How shall the ark of the LORD come to me ?
so David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David : but David carried it aside into the house of O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom the G@@ it@@ tite .
and it was so , that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six p@@ aces , he sacrificed ox@@ en and fat@@ lings .
and as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David , Mic@@ h@@ al Saul 's daughter looked through a window , and saw king David le@@ aping and dancing before the LORD ; and she desp@@ ised him in her heart .
and they brought in the ark of the LORD , and set it in his place , in the midst of the tab@@ ern@@ acle that David had pit@@ ched for it : and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD .
and David said unto Mic@@ h@@ al , It was before the LORD , which chose me before thy father , and before all his house , to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD , over Israel : therefore will I play before the LORD .
and I will yet be more v@@ ile than thus , and will be base in mine own sight : and of the mai@@ d@@ servants which thou hast spoken of , of them shall I be had in honour .
whereas I have not d@@ wel@@ t in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt , even to this day , but have walked in a tent and in a tab@@ ern@@ acle .
now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , I took thee from the she@@ ep@@ co@@ te , from following the sheep , to be ruler over my people , over Israel :
and I was with thee whi@@ ther@@ soever thou w@@ ent@@ est , and have cut off all th@@ ine enemies out of thy sight , and have made thee a great name , like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth .
and as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel , and have caused thee to rest from all th@@ ine enemies . also the LORD tell@@ eth thee that he will make thee an house .
and when thy days be fulfilled , and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers , I will set up thy seed after thee , which shall proceed out of thy bow@@ els , and I will establish his kingdom .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . if he commit ini@@ qu@@ ity , I will cha@@ sten him with the rod of men , and with the stri@@ pes of the children of men :
and this was yet a small thing in thy sight , O Lord GO@@ D ; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant 's house for a great while to come . and is this the manner of man , O Lord GO@@ D ?
W@@ herefore thou art great , O LORD God : for there is none like thee , neither is there any God beside thee , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
for thou , O LORD of hosts , God of Israel , hast revealed to thy servant , saying , I will build thee an house : therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee .
therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant , that it may continue for ever before thee : for thou , O Lord GO@@ D , hast spoken it : and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever .
of Syria , and of Mo@@ ab , and of the children of Am@@ mon , and of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and of A@@ mal@@ ek , and of the spoil of Had@@ ad@@ ez@@ er , son of Re@@ ho@@ b , king of Z@@ ob@@ ah .
and Z@@ ad@@ ok the son of Ah@@ it@@ u@@ b , and A@@ him@@ elec@@ h the son of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar , were the priests ; and Ser@@ aiah was the scri@@ be ;
and there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was Zi@@ ba . and when they had called him unto David , the king said unto him , Art thou Zi@@ ba ? and he said , Th@@ y servant is he .
and the king said , Is there not yet any of the house of Saul , that I may sh@@ ew the kindness of God unto him ? and Zi@@ ba said unto the king , Jonathan hath yet a son , which is lame on his feet .
and the king said unto him , Where is he ? and Zi@@ ba said unto the king , Be@@ hold , he is in the house of Mach@@ ir , the son of Am@@ mi@@ el , in L@@ o @@@ -@@ @ deb@@ ar .
then king David sent , and fetched him out of the house of Mach@@ ir , the son of Am@@ mi@@ el , from L@@ o @@@ -@@ @ deb@@ ar .
now when M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth , the son of Jonathan , the son of Saul , was come unto David , he fell on his face , and did reverence . and David said , M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth . and he answered , Be@@ hold thy servant !
and David said unto him , Fe@@ ar not : for I will surely sh@@ ew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father 's sake , and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father ; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually .
then the king called to Zi@@ ba , Saul 's servant , and said unto him , I have given unto thy master 's son all that per@@ tained to Saul and to all his house .
and M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth had a young son , whose name was Mic@@ ha . and all that d@@ wel@@ t in the house of Zi@@ ba were servants unto M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth .
W@@ herefore H@@ anu@@ n took David 's servants , and sha@@ ved off the one half of their be@@ ards , and cut off their garments in the middle , even to their but@@ to@@ cks , and sent them away .
and when the children of Am@@ mon saw that they stan@@ k before David , the children of Am@@ mon sent and hired the Syrians of B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ re@@ ho@@ b , and the Syrians of Z@@ ob@@ a , twenty thousand foot@@ men , and of king Ma@@ ac@@ ah a thousand men , and of Is@@ h @@@ -@@ @ to@@ b twelve thousand men .
and when David heard of it , he sent Jo@@ ab , and all the host of the mighty men .
and he said , If the Syrians be too strong for me , then thou shalt help me : but if the children of Am@@ mon be too strong for thee , then I will come and help thee .
be of good courage , and let us play the men for our people , and for the cities of our God : and the LORD do that which seem@@ eth him good .
and when the children of Am@@ mon saw that the Syrians were fled , then fled they also before Ab@@ is@@ hai , and entered into the city . so Jo@@ ab returned from the children of Am@@ mon , and came to Jerusalem .
and Had@@ are@@ zer sent , and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river : and they came to Hel@@ am ; and Sho@@ bach the captain of the host of Had@@ are@@ zer went before them .
and when it was told David , he gathered all Israel together , and passed over Jordan , and came to Hel@@ am . and the Syrians set themselves in array against David , and fought with him .
and the Syrians fled before Israel ; and David sle@@ w the men of seven hundred ch@@ ari@@ ots of the Syrians , and forty thousand hor@@ sem@@ en , and smo@@ te Sho@@ bach the captain of their host , who died there .
and when all the kings that were servants to Had@@ are@@ zer saw that they were sm@@ it@@ ten before Israel , they made peace with Israel , and served them . so the Syrians feared to help the children of Am@@ mon any more .
and David sent and inqui@@ red after the woman . and one said , Is not this Bath @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba , the daughter of Eli@@ am , the wife of Uri@@ ah the Hit@@ tite ?
and David sent messengers , and took her ; and she came in unto him , and he lay with her ; for she was purified from her un@@ clean@@ ness : and she returned unto her house .
and David said to Uri@@ ah , Go down to thy house , and wash thy feet . and Uri@@ ah departed out of the king 's house , and there followed him a mess of meat from the king .
but Uri@@ ah slept at the door of the king 's house with all the servants of his lord , and went not down to his house .
and when they had told David , saying , Uri@@ ah went not down unto his house , David said unto Uri@@ ah , Cam@@ est thou not from thy journey ? why then did@@ st thou not go down unto th@@ ine house ?
and when David had called him , he did eat and drink before him ; and he made him drunk : and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord , but went not down to his house .
and he wrote in the letter , saying , Set ye Uri@@ ah in the forefront of the hot@@ test battle , and retire ye from him , that he may be sm@@ it@@ ten , and die .
and the men of the city went out , and fought with Jo@@ ab : and there fell some of the people of the servants of David ; and Uri@@ ah the Hit@@ tite died also .
and if so be that the king 's wrath arise , and he say unto thee , W@@ herefore approached ye so ni@@ gh unto the city when ye did fight ? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall ?
so the messenger went , and came and sh@@ ew@@ ed David all that Jo@@ ab had sent him for .
and the messenger said unto David , Su@@ rely the men prevailed against us , and came out unto us into the field , and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate .
and the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants ; and some of the king 's servants be dead , and thy servant Uri@@ ah the Hit@@ tite is dead also .
and the LORD sent Na@@ than unto David . and he came unto him , and said unto him , There were two men in one city ; the one rich , and the other poor .
and Na@@ than said to David , Th@@ ou art the man . thus sa@@ ith the LORD God of Israel , I ano@@ inted thee king over Israel , and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul ;
and I gave thee thy master 's house , and thy master 's wives into thy bos@@ om , and gave thee the house of Israel and of Jud@@ ah ; and if that had been too little , I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Be@@ hold , I will raise up evil against thee out of th@@ ine own house , and I will take thy wives before th@@ ine eyes , and give them unto thy neighbour , and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun .
for thou did@@ st it secretly : but I will do this thing before all Israel , and before the sun .
and David said unto Na@@ than , I have sin@@ ned against the LORD . and Na@@ than said unto David , The LORD also hath put away thy sin ; thou shalt not die .
and the elders of his house arose , and went to him , to raise him up from the earth : but he would not , neither did he eat bread with them .
then David arose from the earth , and washed , and ano@@ inted himself , and changed his app@@ arel , and came into the house of the LORD , and wor@@ shipped : then he came to his own house ; and when he required , they set bread before him , and he did eat .
then said his servants unto him , What thing is this that thou hast done ? thou did@@ st fast and we@@ ep for the child , while it was alive ; but when the child was dead , thou did@@ st rise and eat bread .
and he said , While the child was yet alive , I fast@@ ed and we@@ pt : for I said , Who can tell whether GO@@ D will be gr@@ acious to me , that the child may live ?
and David comfor@@ ted Bath @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba his wife , and went in unto her , and lay with her : and she bare a son , and he called his name Solomon : and the LORD loved him .
and Jo@@ ab sent messengers to David , and said , I have fought against Rab@@ ba@@ h , and have taken the city of waters .
now therefore gather the rest of the people together , and enc@@ amp against the city , and take it : lest I take the city , and it be called after my name .
and he took their king 's crown from off his head , the weight where@@ of was a talent of gold with the precious stones : and it was set on David 's head . and he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance .
and it came to pass after this , that Ab@@ sal@@ om the son of David had a fair sister , whose name was Tam@@ ar ; and Am@@ non the son of David loved her .
and he said unto him , Why art thou , being the king 's son , lean from day to day ? wil@@ t thou not tell me ? and Am@@ non said unto him , I love Tam@@ ar , my brother Ab@@ sal@@ om 's sister .
and she took a pan , and poured them out before him ; but he refused to eat . and Am@@ non said , Have out all men from me . and they went out every man from him .
and she answered him , N@@ ay , my brother , do not force me ; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel : do not thou this folly .
and I , whi@@ ther shall I cause my shame to go ? and as for thee , thou shalt be as one of the fo@@ ols in Israel . now therefore , I pray thee , speak unto the king ; for he will not with@@ hold me from thee .
and she said unto him , There is no cause : this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou did@@ st unto me . but he would not hear@@ ken unto her .
and she had a garment of divers colours upon her : for with such robes were the king 's daughters that were vir@@ gins ap@@ pa@@ rel@@ led . then his servant brought her out , and bol@@ ted the door after her .
and it came to pass after two full years , that Ab@@ sal@@ om had she@@ ep@@ sh@@ ear@@ ers in Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ Haz@@ or , which is beside E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : and Ab@@ sal@@ om invited all the king 's sons .
and Ab@@ sal@@ om came to the king , and said , Be@@ hold now , thy servant hath she@@ ep@@ sh@@ ear@@ ers ; let the king , I bes@@ e@@ ech thee , and his servants go with thy servant .
and the servants of Ab@@ sal@@ om did unto Am@@ non as Ab@@ sal@@ om had commanded . then all the king 's sons arose , and every man G@@ at him up upon his mu@@ le , and fled .
and it came to pass , while they were in the way , that ti@@ dings came to David , saying , Ab@@ sal@@ om hath sl@@ ain all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left .
now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart , to think that all the king 's sons are dead : for Am@@ non only is dead .
but Ab@@ sal@@ om fled . and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him .
and when the woman of Te@@ ko@@ ah sp@@ ake to the king , she fell on her face to the ground , and did obe@@ is@@ ance , and said , Help , O king .
and the king said unto her , What ail@@ eth thee ? and she answered , I am indeed a widow woman , and mine husband is dead .
and thy hand@@ maid had two sons , and they two stro@@ ve together in the field , and there was none to part them , but the one smo@@ te the other , and sle@@ w him .
and the king said unto the woman , Go to th@@ ine house , and I will give charge concerning thee .
and the woman of Te@@ ko@@ ah said unto the king , My lord , O king , the ini@@ qu@@ ity be on me , and on my father 's house : and the king and his throne be guil@@ tless .
for we must needs die , and are as water spil@@ t on the ground , which C@@ AN@@ NOT be gathered up again ; neither do@@ th God respect any person : yet do@@ th he devise means , that his ban@@ ished be not expelled from him .
for the king will hear , to deliver his hand@@ maid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God .
then th@@ ine hand@@ maid said , The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable : for as an angel of God , so is my lord the king to discern good and bad : therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee .
then the king answered and said unto the woman , Hi@@ de not from me , I pray thee , the thing that I shall ask thee . and the woman said , Let my lord the king now speak .
to fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Jo@@ ab done this thing : and my lord is wise , according to the wisdom of an angel of God , to know all things that are in the earth .
and the king said unto Jo@@ ab , Be@@ hold now , I have done this thing : go therefore , bring the young man Ab@@ sal@@ om again .
and Jo@@ ab fell to the ground on his face , and bowed himself , and thanked the king : and Jo@@ ab said , To day thy servant know@@ eth that I have found grace in thy sight , my lord , O king , in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant .
and the king said , Let him turn to his own house , and let him not see my face . so Ab@@ sal@@ om returned to his own house , and saw not the king 's face .
but in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Ab@@ sal@@ om for his beauty : from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no bl@@ emish in him .
and unto Ab@@ sal@@ om there were born three sons , and one daughter , whose name was Tam@@ ar : she was a woman of a fair coun@@ tenance .
therefore he said unto his servants , See , Jo@@ ab 's field is near mine , and he hath barley there ; go and set it on fire . and Ab@@ sal@@ om 's servants set the field on fire .
so Jo@@ ab came to the king , and told him : and when he had called for Ab@@ sal@@ om , he came to the king , and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king kis@@ sed Ab@@ sal@@ om .
and Ab@@ sal@@ om said unto him , See , thy matters are good and right ; but there is no man de@@ puted of the king to hear thee .
and on this manner did Ab@@ sal@@ om to all Israel that came to the king for judgment : so Ab@@ sal@@ om stole the hearts of the men of Israel .
and it came to pass after forty years , that Ab@@ sal@@ om said unto the king , I pray thee , let me go and pay my vo@@ w , which I have vowed unto the LORD , in He@@ br@@ on .
for thy servant vowed a vo@@ w while I ab@@ ode at G@@ es@@ hu@@ r in Syria , saying , If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem , then I will serve the LORD .
but Ab@@ sal@@ om sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel , saying , As soon as ye hear the sound of the trum@@ pet , then ye shall say , Ab@@ sal@@ om re@@ ig@@ neth in He@@ br@@ on .
and Ab@@ sal@@ om sent for A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el the Gil@@ on@@ ite , David 's coun@@ seller , from his city , even from Gil@@ oh , while he offered sacrifices . and the conspiracy was strong ; for the people increased continually with Ab@@ sal@@ om .
and there came a messenger to David , saying , The hearts of the men of Israel are after Ab@@ sal@@ om .
and the king 's servants said unto the king , Be@@ hold , thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint .
then said the king to It@@ tai the G@@ it@@ tite , W@@ herefore go@@ est thou also with us ? return to thy place , and abide with the king : for thou art a stranger , and also an exile .
whereas thou cam@@ est but yesterday , should I this day make thee go up and down with us ? seeing I go whi@@ ther I may , return thou , and take back thy brethren : mercy and truth be with thee .
and It@@ tai answered the king , and said , As the LORD liv@@ eth , and as my lord the king liv@@ eth , surely in what place my lord the king shall be , whether in death or life , even there also will thy servant be .
and lo Z@@ ad@@ ok also , and all the Lev@@ ites were with him , bearing the ark of the covenant of God : and they set down the ark of God ; and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar went up , until all the people had done passing out of the city .
and the king said unto Z@@ ad@@ ok , Car@@ ry back the ark of God into the city : if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD , he will bring me again , and sh@@ ew me both it , and his hab@@ itation :
the king said also unto Z@@ ad@@ ok the priest , Art not thou a se@@ er ? return into the city in peace , and your two sons with you , A@@ him@@ a@@ az thy son , and Jonathan the son of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar .
and David went up by the ascent of mount O@@ liv@@ et , and we@@ pt as he went up , and had his head covered , and he went b@@ are@@ foot : and all the people that was with him covered every man his head , and they went up , we@@ eping as they went up .
and one told David , saying , A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el is among the conspir@@ ators with Ab@@ sal@@ om . and David said , O LORD , I pray thee , turn the counsel of A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el into fool@@ is@@ hness .
and it came to pass , that when David was come to the top of the mount , where he wor@@ shipped God , behold , Hus@@ hai the Arch@@ ite came to meet him with his coat rent , and earth upon his head :
but if thou return to the city , and say unto Ab@@ sal@@ om , I will be thy servant , O king ; as I have been thy father 's servant hitherto , so will I now also be thy servant : then may@@ est thou for me defeat the counsel of A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el .
behold , they have there with them their two sons , A@@ him@@ a@@ az Z@@ ad@@ ok 's son , and Jonathan A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar 's son ; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear .
and the king said , And where is thy master 's son ? and Zi@@ ba said unto the king , Be@@ hold , he ab@@ id@@ eth at Jerusalem : for he said , To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father .
then said the king to Zi@@ ba , Be@@ hold , th@@ ine are all that per@@ tained unto M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth . and Zi@@ ba said , I hum@@ bly bes@@ e@@ ech thee that I may find grace in thy sight , my lord , O king .
and he cast stones at David , and at all the servants of king David : and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left .
the LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul , in whose stead thou hast re@@ igned ; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Ab@@ sal@@ om thy son : and , behold , thou art taken in thy mis@@ chief , because thou art a bloody man .
then said Ab@@ is@@ hai the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah unto the king , Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king ? let me go over , I pray thee , and take off his head .
and the king said , What have I to do with you , ye sons of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah ? so let him curse , because the LORD hath said unto him , Cur@@ se David . who shall then say , W@@ herefore hast thou done so ?
it may be that the LORD will look on mine afflic@@ tion , and that the LORD will requ@@ ite me good for his cur@@ sing this day .
and as David and his men went by the way , Shim@@ ei went along on the hill 's side over against him , and cur@@ sed as he went , and threw stones at him , and cast dust .
and Ab@@ sal@@ om , and all the people the men of Israel , came to Jerusalem , and A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el with him .
and it came to pass , when Hus@@ hai the Arch@@ ite , David 's friend , was come unto Ab@@ sal@@ om , that Hus@@ hai said unto Ab@@ sal@@ om , God save the king , God save the king .
and Hus@@ hai said unto Ab@@ sal@@ om , N@@ ay ; but whom the LORD , and this people , and all the men of Israel , choose , his will I be , and with him will I abide .
and A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el said unto Ab@@ sal@@ om , Go in unto thy father 's conc@@ ub@@ ines , which he hath left to keep the house ; and all Israel shall hear that thou art ab@@ hor@@ red of thy father : then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong .
and I will bring back all the people unto thee : the man whom thou see@@ k@@ est is as if all returned : so all the people shall be in peace .
and he also that is val@@ i@@ ant , whose heart is as the heart of a lion , shall utterly melt : for all Israel know@@ eth that thy father is a mighty man , and they which be with him are val@@ i@@ ant men .
therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee , from Dan even to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba , as the sand that is by the sea for multitude ; and that thou go to battle in th@@ ine own person .
then said Hus@@ hai unto Z@@ ad@@ ok and to A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the priests , Th@@ us and thus did A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el counsel Ab@@ sal@@ om and the elders of Israel ; and thus and thus have I counsel@@ led .
now therefore send quickly , and tell David , saying , Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness , but spe@@ ed@@ ily pass over ; lest the king be swallowed up , and all the people that are with him .
nevertheless a l@@ ad saw them , and told Ab@@ sal@@ om : but they went both of them away quickly , and came to a man 's house in Bah@@ ur@@ im , which had a well in his court ; whi@@ ther they went down .
and when Ab@@ sal@@ om 's servants came to the woman to the house , they said , Where is A@@ him@@ a@@ az and Jonathan ? and the woman said unto them , They be gone over the bro@@ ok of water . and when they had sought and could not find them , they returned to Jerusalem .
and it came to pass , after they were departed , that they came up out of the well , and went and told king David , and said unto David , A@@ rise , and pass quickly over the water : for thus hath A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el counsel@@ led against you .
then David arose , and all the people that were with him , and they passed over Jordan : by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan .
and Ab@@ sal@@ om made A@@ mas@@ a captain of the host instead of Jo@@ ab : which A@@ mas@@ a was a man 's son , whose name was I@@ thr@@ a an Israel@@ ite , that went in to Ab@@ ig@@ ail the daughter of N@@ ah@@ ash , sister to Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah Jo@@ ab 's mother .
and it came to pass , when David was come to Ma@@ han@@ aim , that Sho@@ bi the son of N@@ ah@@ ash of Rab@@ ba@@ h of the children of Am@@ mon , and Mach@@ ir the son of Am@@ mi@@ el of L@@ o @@@ -@@ @ deb@@ ar , and Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i the Gil@@ e@@ ad@@ ite of Rog@@ eli@@ m ,
and honey , and butter , and sheep , and cheese of k@@ ine , for David , and for the people that were with him , to eat : for they said , The people is hungry , and weary , and thir@@ sty , in the wilderness .
and the king commanded Jo@@ ab and Ab@@ is@@ hai and It@@ tai , saying , Deal gently for my sake with the young man , even with Ab@@ sal@@ om . and all the people heard when the king gave all the cap@@ tains charge concerning Ab@@ sal@@ om .
and a certain man saw it , and told Jo@@ ab , and said , Be@@ hold , I saw Ab@@ sal@@ om han@@ ged in an oak .
and Jo@@ ab said unto the man that told him , And , behold , thou saw@@ est him , and why did@@ st thou not sm@@ ite him there to the ground ? and I would have given thee ten she@@ k@@ els of silver , and a gir@@ dle .
then said Jo@@ ab , I may not tar@@ ry thus with thee . and he took three dar@@ ts in his hand , and thrust them through the heart of Ab@@ sal@@ om , while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak .
and they took Ab@@ sal@@ om , and cast him into a great pit in the wood , and laid a very great heap of stones upon him : and all Israel fled every one to his tent .
and Jo@@ ab said unto him , Th@@ ou shalt not bear ti@@ dings this day , but thou shalt bear ti@@ dings another day : but this day thou shalt bear no ti@@ dings , because the king 's son is dead .
and David sat between the two gates : and the watch@@ man went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold a man running alone .
and the watch@@ man cried , and told the king . and the king said , If he be alone , there is ti@@ dings in his mouth . and he came ap@@ ace , and drew near .
and the watch@@ man saw another man running : and the watch@@ man called unto the porter , and said , Be@@ hold another man running alone . and the king said , He also br@@ ing@@ eth ti@@ dings .
and the watch@@ man said , Me thin@@ ket@@ h the running of the foremost is like the running of A@@ him@@ a@@ az the son of Z@@ ad@@ ok . and the king said , He is a good man , and com@@ eth with good ti@@ dings .
and the king said , Is the young man Ab@@ sal@@ om safe ? and A@@ him@@ a@@ az answered , When Jo@@ ab sent the king 's servant , and me thy servant , I saw a great tum@@ ult , but I knew not what it was .
and the king said unto C@@ ush@@ i , Is the young man Ab@@ sal@@ om safe ? and C@@ ush@@ i answered , The enemies of my lord the king , and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt , be as that young man is .
but the king covered his face , and the king cried with a loud voice , O my son Ab@@ sal@@ om , O Ab@@ sal@@ om , my son , my son !
then the king arose , and sat in the gate . and they told unto all the people , saying , Be@@ hold , the king do@@ th sit in the gate . and all the people came before the king : for Israel had fled every man to his tent .
so the king returned , and came to Jordan . and Jud@@ ah came to Gil@@ gal , to go to meet the king , to conduct the king over Jordan .
and there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Zi@@ ba the servant of the house of Saul , and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went over Jordan before the king .
and there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king 's household , and to do what he thought good . and Shim@@ ei the son of Ger@@ a fell down before the king , as he was come over Jordan ;
for thy servant do@@ th know that I have sin@@ ned : therefore , behold , I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king .
but Ab@@ is@@ hai the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah answered and said , Sh@@ all not Shim@@ ei be put to death for this , because he cur@@ sed the LORD 's ano@@ inted ?
and it came to pass , when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king , that the king said unto him , W@@ herefore w@@ ent@@ est not thou with me , M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth ?
and he answered , My lord , O king , my servant deceived me : for thy servant said , I will sadd@@ le me an ass , that I may ride there@@ on , and go to the king ; because thy servant is lame .
and he hath slan@@ dered thy servant unto my lord the king ; but my lord the king is as an angel of God : do therefore what is good in th@@ ine eyes .
for all of my father 's house were but dead men before my lord the king : yet did@@ st thou set thy servant among them that did eat at th@@ ine own table . what right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king ?
and Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i the Gil@@ e@@ ad@@ ite came down from Rog@@ eli@@ m , and went over Jordan with the king , to conduct him over Jordan .
now Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i was a very aged man , even four@@ score years old : and he had provided the king of sust@@ en@@ ance while he lay at Ma@@ han@@ aim ; for he was a very great man .
and the king said unto Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i , Come thou over with me , and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem .
and Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i said unto the king , How long have I to live , that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem ?
thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king : and why should the king re@@ comp@@ ense it me with such a reward ?
and the king answered , Ch@@ im@@ ham shall go over with me , and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee : and whatsoever thou shalt require of me , that will I do for thee .
and all the people went over Jordan . and when the king was come over , the king kis@@ sed Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i , and blessed him ; and he returned unto his own place .
then the king went on to Gil@@ gal , and Ch@@ im@@ ham went on with him : and all the people of Jud@@ ah conducted the king , and also half the people of Israel .
and , behold , all the men of Israel came to the king , and said unto the king , Why have our brethren the men of Jud@@ ah stolen thee away , and have brought the king , and his household , and all David 's men with him , over Jordan ?
so every man of Israel went up from after David , and followed She@@ ba the son of B@@ ich@@ ri : but the men of Jud@@ ah cl@@ ave unto their king , from Jordan even to Jerusalem .
and one of Jo@@ ab 's men stood by him , and said , He that fav@@ ou@@ re@@ th Jo@@ ab , and he that is for David , let him go after Jo@@ ab .
and he went through all the tribes of Israel unto A@@ bel , and to B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ ma@@ acha@@ h , and all the Ber@@ ites : and they were gathered together , and went also after him .
then cried a wise woman out of the city , He@@ ar , hear ; say , I pray you , unto Jo@@ ab , Come near hi@@ ther , that I may speak with thee .
and when he was come near unto her , the woman said , Art thou Jo@@ ab ? and he answered , I am he . then she said unto him , He@@ ar the words of th@@ ine hand@@ maid . and he answered , I do hear .
I am one of them that are peace@@ able and faithful in Israel : thou see@@ k@@ est to destroy a city and a mother in Israel : why wil@@ t thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD ?
W@@ herefore David said unto the Gi@@ be@@ on@@ ites , What shall I do for you ? and where@@ with shall I make the at@@ onement , that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD ?
let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us , and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gi@@ be@@ ah of Saul , whom the LORD did choose . and the king said , I will give them .
but the king spared M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth , the son of Jonathan the son of Saul , because of the LORD 's oath that was between them , between David and Jonathan the son of Saul .
but the king took the two sons of R@@ iz@@ pa@@ h the daughter of Ai@@ ah , whom she bare unto Saul , Ar@@ mon@@ i and M@@ ep@@ hib@@ osh@@ eth ; and the five sons of Mic@@ h@@ al the daughter of Saul , whom she brought up for Adri@@ el the son of Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i the Me@@ hol@@ ath@@ ite :
and it was told David what R@@ iz@@ pa@@ h the daughter of Ai@@ ah , the conc@@ ub@@ ine of Saul , had done .
and David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jab@@ esh @@@ -@@ @ Gil@@ e@@ ad , which had stolen them from the street of B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ Sh@@ an , where the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had han@@ ged them , when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines had sl@@ ain Saul in Gil@@ bo@@ a :
and the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zel@@ ah , in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of K@@ ish his father : and they performed all that the king commanded . and after that God was int@@ re@@ ated for the land .
and there was again a battle in GO@@ B with the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , where El@@ han@@ an the son of Ja@@ are @@@ -@@ @ ore@@ gi@@ m , a Beth@@ le@@ hem@@ ite , sle@@ w the brother of G@@ oli@@ ath the G@@ it@@ tite , the staff of whose spe@@ ar was like a we@@ aver 's beam .
these four were born to the giant in G@@ ath , and fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
and David sp@@ ake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of Saul :
the God of my rock ; in him will I trust : he is my shield , and the horn of my salvation , my high tower , and my refuge , my s@@ avi@@ our ; thou sav@@ est me from violence .
there went up a smoke out of his no@@ str@@ ils , and fire out of his mouth dev@@ oured : co@@ als were kind@@ led by it .
and he made darkness pav@@ ili@@ ons round about him , dark waters , and thick clouds of the skies .
he delivered me from my strong enemy , and from them that hated me : for they were too strong for me .
the LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness : according to the clean@@ ness of my hands hath he re@@ comp@@ en@@ sed me .
for I have kept the ways of the LORD , and have not w@@ ick@@ edly departed from my God .
with the pure thou wil@@ t sh@@ ew thy@@ self pure ; and with the fro@@ ward thou wil@@ t sh@@ ew thy@@ self un@@ sav@@ our@@ y .
as for God , his way is perfect ; the word of the LORD is tried : he is a Buck@@ ler to all them that trust in him .
he teach@@ eth my hands to war ; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms .
thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation : and thy gentl@@ eness hath made me great .
thou hast also given me the nec@@ ks of mine enemies , that I might destroy them that hate me .
the LORD liv@@ eth ; and blessed be my rock ; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation .
therefore I will give thanks unto thee , O LORD , among the he@@ a@@ then , and I will sing pra@@ ises unto thy name .
the God of Israel said , the Rock of Israel sp@@ ake to me , He that rul@@ eth over men must be just , ruling in the fear of God .
and after him was Sham@@ ma@@ h the son of A@@ ge@@ e the Har@@ ar@@ ite . and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were gathered together into a troop , where was a piece of ground full of l@@ enti@@ les : and the people fled from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
but he stood in the midst of the ground , and defended it , and sle@@ w the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and the LORD wrought a great victory .
and three of the thirty chief went down , and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Ad@@ ul@@ lam : and the troop of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines pit@@ ched in the valley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
and David long@@ ed , and said , Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem , which is by the gate !
and the three mighty men brake through the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : nevertheless he would not drink thereof , but poured it out unto the LORD .
and he said , Be it far from me , O LORD , that I should do this : is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopar@@ dy of their lives ? therefore he would not drink it . these things did these three mighty men .
and Ab@@ is@@ hai , the brother of Jo@@ ab , the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , was chief among three . and he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred , and sle@@ w them , and had the name among three .
was he not most hon@@ our@@ able of three ? therefore he was their captain : How@@ be@@ it he attained not unto the first three .
and Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , the son of a val@@ i@@ ant man , of Kab@@ ze@@ el , who had done many acts , he sle@@ w two lion@@ like men of Mo@@ ab : he went down also and sle@@ w a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow :
and he sle@@ w an Egyptian , a goo@@ dly man : and the Egyptian had a spe@@ ar in his hand ; but he went down to him with a staff , and pl@@ ucked the spe@@ ar out of the Egyptian 's hand , and sle@@ w him with his own spe@@ ar .
Hel@@ eb the son of Ba@@ an@@ ah , a Net@@ op@@ ha@@ th@@ ite , It@@ tai the son of Ri@@ bai out of Gi@@ be@@ ah of the children of Benjamin ,
and again the anger of the LORD was kind@@ led against Israel , and he moved David against them to say , Go , number Israel and Jud@@ ah .
and they passed over Jordan , and pit@@ ched in A@@ ro@@ er , on the right side of the city that li@@ eth in the midst of the river of G@@ ad , and toward J@@ az@@ er :
and Jo@@ ab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king : and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand val@@ i@@ ant men that drew the sword ; and the men of Jud@@ ah were five hundred thousand men .
for when David was up in the morning , the word of the LORD came unto the prophet G@@ ad , David 's se@@ er , saying ,
and David said unto G@@ ad , I am in a great str@@ ait : let us fall now into the hand of the LORD ; for his mer@@ cies are great : and let me not fall into the hand of man .
so the LORD sent a pesti@@ l@@ ence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed : and there died of the people from Dan even to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba seventy thousand men .
and David sp@@ ake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smo@@ te the people , and said , L@@ o , I have sin@@ ned , and I have done w@@ ick@@ edly : but these sheep , what have they done ? let th@@ ine hand , I pray thee , be against me , and against my father 's house .
and G@@ ad came that day to David , and said unto him , Go up , rear an altar unto the LORD in the thresh@@ ing@@ floor of Ara@@ un@@ ah the Je@@ bus@@ ite .
and Ara@@ un@@ ah looked , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him : and Ara@@ un@@ ah went out , and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground .
and Ara@@ un@@ ah said , W@@ herefore is my lord the king come to his servant ? and David said , To buy the thresh@@ ing@@ floor of thee , to build an altar unto the LORD , that the plague may be stayed from the people .
and Ara@@ un@@ ah said unto David , Let my lord the king take and offer up what seem@@ eth good unto him : behold , here be ox@@ en for burnt sacrifice , and thresh@@ ing instruments and other instruments of the ox@@ en for wood .
all these things did Ara@@ un@@ ah , as a king , give unto the king . and Ara@@ un@@ ah said unto the king , The LORD thy God accept thee .
so they sought for a fair dam@@ sel throughout all the co@@ asts of Israel , and found Ab@@ is@@ ha@@ g a S@@ hun@@ amm@@ ite , and brought her to the king .
then Ad@@ oni@@ jah the son of H@@ agg@@ ith exalted himself , saying , I will be king : and he prepared him ch@@ ari@@ ots and hor@@ sem@@ en , and fifty men to run before him .
and his father had not dis@@ pleased him at any time in saying , Why hast thou done so ? and he also was a very goo@@ dly man ; and his mother bare him after Ab@@ sal@@ om .
but Z@@ ad@@ ok the priest , and Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and Na@@ than the prophet , and Shim@@ ei , and Re@@ i , and the mighty men which belonged to David , were not with Ad@@ oni@@ jah .
and Ad@@ oni@@ jah sle@@ w sheep and ox@@ en and fat cattle by the stone of Zo@@ hel@@ eth , which is by E@@ n @@@ -@@ @ rog@@ el , and called all his brethren the king 's sons , and all the men of Jud@@ ah the king 's servants :
and she said unto him , My lord , thou sw@@ arest by the LORD thy God unto th@@ ine hand@@ maid , saying , As@@ su@@ re@@ dly Solomon thy son shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne .
and he hath sl@@ ain ox@@ en and fat cattle and sheep in abundance , and hath called all the sons of the king , and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the priest , and Jo@@ ab the captain of the host : but Solomon thy servant hath he not called .
and thou , my lord , O king , the eyes of all Israel are upon thee , that thou shoul@@ dest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him .
otherwise it shall come to pass , when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers , that I and my son Solomon shall be counted off@@ enders .
is this thing done by my lord the king , and thou hast not sh@@ ew@@ ed it unto thy servant , who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him ?
and the king sw@@ are , and said , As the LORD liv@@ eth , that hath re@@ deemed my soul out of all distress ,
even as I sw@@ are unto thee by the LORD God of Israel , saying , As@@ su@@ re@@ dly Solomon thy son shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead ; even so will I certainly do this day .
then Bath @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba bowed with her face to the earth , and did reverence to the king , and said , Let my lord king David live for ever .
the king also said unto them , Take with you the servants of your lord , and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mu@@ le , and bring him down to Gi@@ hon :
then ye shall come up after him , that he may come and sit upon my throne ; for he shall be king in my stead : and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Jud@@ ah .
so Z@@ ad@@ ok the priest , and Na@@ than the prophet , and Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and the Pel@@ eth@@ ites , went down , and caused Solomon to ride upon king David 's mu@@ le , and brought him to Gi@@ hon .
and Z@@ ad@@ ok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tab@@ ern@@ acle , and ano@@ inted Solomon . and they blew the trum@@ pet ; and all the people said , God save king Solomon .
and all the people came up after him , and the people pi@@ ped with pipes , and rejo@@ iced with great joy , so that the earth rent with the sound of them .
and while he yet sp@@ ake , behold , Jonathan the son of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the priest came : and Ad@@ oni@@ jah said unto him , Come in ; for thou art a val@@ i@@ ant man , and br@@ ing@@ est good ti@@ dings .
and the king hath sent with him Z@@ ad@@ ok the priest , and Na@@ than the prophet , and Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , and the Cher@@ eth@@ ites , and the Pel@@ eth@@ ites , and they have caused him to ride upon the king 's mu@@ le :
and Z@@ ad@@ ok the priest and Na@@ than the prophet have ano@@ inted him king in Gi@@ hon : and they are come up from th@@ ence rejo@@ icing , so that the city rang again . this is the noise that ye have heard .
and moreover the king 's servants came to bless our lord king David , saying , God make the name of Solomon better than thy name , and make his throne greater than thy throne . and the king bowed himself upon the bed .
and also thus said the king , Bless@@ ed be the LORD God of Israel , which hath given one to sit on my throne this day , mine eyes even seeing it .
and it was told Solomon , saying , Be@@ hold , Ad@@ oni@@ jah fe@@ areth king Solomon : for , lo , he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar , saying , Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not sl@@ ay his servant with the sword .
and Solomon said , If he will sh@@ ew himself a worthy man , there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth : but if w@@ ick@@ edness shall be found in him , he shall die .
so king Solomon sent , and they brought him down from the altar . and he came and bowed himself to king Solomon : and Solomon said unto him , Go to th@@ ine house .
now the days of David drew ni@@ gh that he should die ; and he charged Solomon his son , saying ,
do therefore according to thy wisdom , and let not his ho@@ ar head go down to the grave in peace .
but sh@@ ew kindness unto the sons of Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i the Gil@@ e@@ ad@@ ite , and let them be of those that eat at thy table : for so they came to me when I fled because of Ab@@ sal@@ om thy brother .
now therefore hold him not guil@@ tless : for thou art a wise man , and know@@ est what thou ough@@ test to do unto him ; but his ho@@ ar head bring thou down to the grave with blood .
and the days that David re@@ igned over Israel were forty years : seven years re@@ igned he in He@@ br@@ on , and thirty and three years re@@ igned he in Jerusalem .
and he said , Spe@@ ak , I pray thee , unto Solomon the king , ( for he will not say thee n@@ ay , ) that he give me Ab@@ is@@ ha@@ g the S@@ hun@@ amm@@ ite to wife .
then she said , I desire one small petition of thee ; I pray thee , say me not n@@ ay . and the king said unto her , As@@ k on , my mother : for I will not say thee n@@ ay .
now therefore , as the LORD liv@@ eth , which hath established me , and set me on the throne of David my father , and who hath made me an house , as he promised , Ad@@ oni@@ jah shall be put to death this day .
and king Solomon sent by the hand of Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada ; and he fell upon him that he died .
and it was told king Solomon that Jo@@ ab was fled unto the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the LORD ; and , behold , he is by the altar . then Solomon sent Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , saying , Go , fall upon him .
and Ben@@ aiah came to the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the LORD , and said unto him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the king , Come forth . and he said , N@@ ay ; but I will die here . and Ben@@ aiah brought the king word again , saying , Th@@ us said Jo@@ ab , and thus he answered me .
and the king said unto him , Do as he hath said , and fall upon him , and bury him ; that thou may@@ est take away the innocent blood , which Jo@@ ab shed , from me , and from the house of my father .
their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Jo@@ ab , and upon the head of his seed for ever : but upon David , and upon his seed , and upon his house , and upon his throne , shall there be peace for ever from the LORD .
and the king put Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada in his room over the host : and Z@@ ad@@ ok the priest did the king put in the room of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar .
and the king sent and called for Shim@@ ei , and said unto him , Build thee an house in Jerusalem , and dwell there , and go not forth th@@ ence any whi@@ ther .
and Shim@@ ei said unto the king , The saying is good : as my lord the king hath said , so will thy servant do . and Shim@@ ei d@@ wel@@ t in Jerusalem many days .
and it came to pass at the end of three years , that two of the servants of Shim@@ ei ran away unto Ach@@ ish son of Ma@@ acha@@ h king of G@@ ath . and they told Shim@@ ei , saying , Be@@ hold , thy servants be in G@@ ath .
why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD , and the commandment that I have charged thee with ?
the king said moreover to Shim@@ ei , Th@@ ou know@@ est all the w@@ ick@@ edness which th@@ ine heart is priv@@ y to , that thou did@@ st to David my father : therefore the LORD shall return thy w@@ ick@@ edness upon th@@ ine own head ;
only the people sacrificed in high places , because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD , until those days .
and now , O LORD my God , thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father : and I am but a little child : I know not how to go out or come in .
and God said unto him , Because thou hast asked this thing , and hast not asked for thy@@ self long life ; neither hast asked riches for thy@@ self , nor hast asked the life of th@@ ine enemies ; but hast asked for thy@@ self understanding to discern judgment ;
behold , I have done according to thy words : lo , I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart ; so that there was none like thee before thee , neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee .
and I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked , both riches , and honour : so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days .
and Solomon aw@@ oke ; and , behold , it was a dream . and he came to Jerusalem , and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD , and offered up burnt offerings , and offered peace offerings , and made a feast to all his servants .
and it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered , that this woman was delivered also : and we were together ; there was no stranger with us in the house , save we two in the house .
and when I rose in the morning to give my child su@@ ck , behold , it was dead : but when I had considered it in the morning , behold , it was not my son , which I did bear .
and the other woman said , N@@ ay ; but the living is my son , and the dead is thy son . and this said , No ; but the dead is thy son , and the living is my son . thus they sp@@ ake before the king .
then said the king , The one sa@@ ith , This is my son that liv@@ eth , and thy son is the dead : and the other sa@@ ith , N@@ ay ; but thy son is the dead , and my son is the living .
and the king said , B@@ ring me a sword . and they brought a sword before the king .
and all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged ; and they feared the king : for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him , to do judgment .
and Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada was over the host : and Z@@ ad@@ ok and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar were the priests :
and Az@@ ari@@ ah the son of Na@@ than was over the officers : and Zab@@ ud the son of Na@@ than was principal officer , and the king 's friend :
Ge@@ ber the son of U@@ ri was in the country of Gil@@ e@@ ad , in the country of Si@@ hon king of the A@@ mor@@ ites , and of O@@ g king of Bash@@ an ; and he was the only officer which was in the land .
for he had dom@@ inion over all the region on this side the river , from Ti@@ ph@@ s@@ ah even to A@@ zz@@ ah , over all the kings on this side the river : and he had peace on all sides round about him .
and Jud@@ ah and Israel d@@ wel@@ t safely , every man under his vine and under his fi@@ g tree , from Dan even to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba , all the days of Solomon .
and God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much , and lar@@ gen@@ ess of heart , even as the sand that is on the sea shore .
and he sp@@ ake of trees , from the c@@ edar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the h@@ ys@@ so@@ p that spring@@ eth out of the wall : he sp@@ ake also of beasts , and of f@@ owl , and of cre@@ eping things , and of f@@ ishes .
and there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon , from all kings of the earth , which had heard of his wisdom .
thou know@@ est how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side , until the LORD put them under the sol@@ es of his feet .
but now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side , so that there is neither adversary nor evil oc@@ current .
and , behold , I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God , as the LORD sp@@ ake unto David my father , saying , Th@@ y son , whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room , he shall build an house unto my name .
and Hir@@ am sent to Solomon , saying , I have considered the things which thou sent@@ est to me for : and I will do all thy desire concerning timber of c@@ edar , and concerning timber of f@@ ir .
and the LORD gave Solomon wisdom , as he promised him : and there was peace between Hir@@ am and Solomon ; and they two made a league together .
and Solomon 's builders and Hir@@ am 's builders did he@@ w them , and the st@@ ones@@ quar@@ ers : so they prepared timber and stones to build the house .
and the house which king Solomon built for the LORD , the length thereof was thre@@ es@@ core cub@@ its , and the breadth thereof twenty cub@@ its , and the height thereof thirty cub@@ its .
the ne@@ ther@@ most chamber was five cub@@ its broad , and the middle was six cub@@ its broad , and the third was seven cub@@ its broad : for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about , that the beams should not be fast@@ ened in the walls of the house .
and the house , when it was in building , was built of stone made ready before it was brought thi@@ ther : so that there was neither hammer nor ax@@ e nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house : and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber , and out of the middle into the third .
so he built the house , and finished it ; and covered the house with beams and boards of c@@ edar .
and he built twenty cub@@ its on the sides of the house , both the floor and the walls with boards of c@@ edar : he even built them for it within , even for the or@@ acle , even for the most holy place .
and the or@@ acle he prepared in the house within , to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD .
and the or@@ acle in the fore@@ part was twenty cub@@ its in length , and twenty cub@@ its in breadth , and twenty cub@@ its in the height thereof : and he over@@ laid it with pure gold ; and so covered the altar which was of c@@ edar .
and the whole house he over@@ laid with gold , until he had finished all the house : also the whole altar that was by the or@@ acle he over@@ laid with gold .
and five cub@@ its was the one wing of the cher@@ u@@ b , and five cub@@ its the other wing of the cher@@ u@@ b : from the utter@@ most part of the one wing unto the utter@@ most part of the other were ten cub@@ its .
and he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cher@@ ub@@ ims and palm trees and open flowers , within and without .
and the two doors were of f@@ ir tree : the two leaves of the one door were folding , and the two leaves of the other door were folding .
and he carved there@@ on cher@@ ub@@ ims and palm trees and open flowers : and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work .
in the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid , in the month Z@@ IF :
and in the eleventh year , in the month Bu@@ l , which is the eighth month , was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof , and according to all the fashion of it . so was he seven years in building it .
he built also the house of the forest of Lebanon ; the length thereof was an hundred cub@@ its , and the breadth thereof fifty cub@@ its , and the height thereof thirty cub@@ its , upon four rows of c@@ edar pillars , with c@@ edar beams upon the pillars .
and he made a por@@ ch of pillars ; the length thereof was fifty cub@@ its , and the breadth thereof thirty cub@@ its : and the por@@ ch was before them : and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them .
and his house where he d@@ wel@@ t had another court within the por@@ ch , which was of the like work . Solomon made also an house for Phar@@ aoh 's daughter , whom he had taken to wife , like unto this por@@ ch .
all these were of costly stones , according to the measures of he@@ wed stones , saw@@ ed with s@@ aws , within and without , even from the foundation unto the coping , and so on the outside toward the great court .
and he made two chap@@ it@@ ers of mol@@ ten brass , to set upon the tops of the pillars : the height of the one chap@@ iter was five cub@@ its , and the height of the other chap@@ iter was five cub@@ its :
and nets of chec@@ ker work , and wre@@ aths of chain work , for the chap@@ it@@ ers which were upon the top of the pillars ; seven for the one chap@@ iter , and seven for the other chap@@ iter .
and he made the pillars , and two rows round about upon the one network , to cover the chap@@ it@@ ers that were upon the top , with p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates : and so did he for the other chap@@ iter .
and the chap@@ it@@ ers that were upon the top of the pillars were of l@@ ily work in the por@@ ch , four cub@@ its .
and the chap@@ it@@ ers upon the two pillars had p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates also above , over against the belly which was by the network : and the p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chap@@ iter .
and he made a mol@@ ten sea , ten cub@@ its from the one bri@@ m to the other : it was round all about , and his height was five cub@@ its : and a line of thirty cub@@ its did compass it round about .
and under the bri@@ m of it round about there were kno@@ ps comp@@ assing it , ten in a cub@@ it , comp@@ assing the sea round about : the kno@@ ps were cast in two rows , when it was cast .
it stood upon twelve ox@@ en , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set above upon them , and all their hinder parts were inward .
and it was an hand breadth thick , and the bri@@ m thereof was wrought like the bri@@ m of a cup , with flowers of l@@ ilies : it contained two thousand baths .
and he made ten bases of brass ; four cub@@ its was the length of one base , and four cub@@ its the breadth thereof , and three cub@@ its the height of it .
and on the borders that were between the le@@ dges were lions , ox@@ en , and cher@@ ub@@ ims : and upon the le@@ dges there was a base above : and beneath the lions and ox@@ en were certain additions made of thin work .
and every base had four br@@ as@@ en wheels , and plates of brass : and the four corners thereof had under@@ set@@ ters : under the lav@@ er were under@@ set@@ ters mol@@ ten , at the side of every addition .
and in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cub@@ it high : and on the top of the base the le@@ dges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same .
for on the plates of the le@@ dges thereof , and on the borders thereof , he gra@@ ved cher@@ ub@@ ims , lions , and palm trees , according to the proportion of every one , and additions round about .
and he put five bases on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south .
and Hir@@ am made the lav@@ ers , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the bas@@ ons . so Hir@@ am made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD :
and four hundred p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates for the two networks , even two rows of p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates for one network , to cover the two bow@@ ls of the chap@@ it@@ ers that were upon the pillars ;
and the pots , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the bas@@ ons : and all these vessels , which Hir@@ am made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD , were of bright brass .
and Solomon made all the vessels that per@@ tained unto the house of the LORD : the altar of gold , and the table of gold , where@@ upon the sh@@ ew@@ bread was ,
and all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month E@@ than@@ im , which is the seventh month .
and they drew out the st@@ aves , that the ends of the st@@ aves were seen out in the holy place before the or@@ acle , and they were not seen without : and there they are unto this day .
there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone , which Moses put there at H@@ ore@@ b , when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of the land of Egypt .
I have surely built thee an house to dwell in , a settled place for thee to abide in for ever .
and the king turned his face about , and blessed all the congregation of Israel : ( and all the congregation of Israel stood ; )
and he said , Bless@@ ed be the LORD God of Israel , which sp@@ ake with his mouth unto David my father , and hath with his hand fulfilled it , saying ,
nevertheless thou shalt not build the house ; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy lo@@ ins , he shall build the house unto my name .
and I have set there a place for the ark , where@@ in is the covenant of the LORD , which he made with our fathers , when he brought them out of the land of Egypt .
and Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heaven :
who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promis@@ ed@@ st him : thou sp@@ ak@@ est also with thy mouth , and hast fulfilled it with th@@ ine hand , as it is this day .
and now , O God of Israel , let thy word , I pray thee , be verified , which thou sp@@ ak@@ est unto thy servant David my father .
but will God indeed dwell on the earth ? behold , the heaven and heaven of heavens C@@ AN@@ NOT contain thee ; how much less this house that I have buil@@ ded ?
yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant , and to his suppl@@ ication , O LORD my God , to hear@@ ken unto the cry and to the prayer , which thy servant pra@@ y@@ eth before thee to day :
and hear@@ ken thou to the suppl@@ ication of thy servant , and of thy people Israel , when they shall pray toward this place : and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place : and when thou he@@ arest , forgive .
then hear thou in heaven , and do , and judge thy servants , condemning the wicked , to bring his way upon his head ; and justi@@ fying the righteous , to give him according to his righteousness .
then hear thou in heaven , and forgive the sin of thy servants , and of thy people Israel , that thou teach them the good way where@@ in they should walk , and give rain upon thy land , which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance .
then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place , and forgive , and do , and give to every man according to his ways , whose heart thou know@@ est ; ( for thou , even thou only , know@@ est the hearts of all the children of men ; )
moreover concerning a stranger , that is not of thy people Israel , but com@@ eth out of a far country for thy name 's sake ;
( for they shall hear of thy great name , and of thy strong hand , and of thy stretched out arm ; ) when he shall come and pray toward this house ;
if they sin against thee , ( for there is no man that sin@@ neth not , ) and thou be angry with them , and deliver them to the enemy , so that they carry them away cap@@ tives unto the land of the enemy , far or near ;
for they be thy people , and th@@ ine inheritance , which thou br@@ ough@@ test forth out of Egypt , from the midst of the furnace of iron :
that th@@ ine eyes may be open unto the suppl@@ ication of thy servant , and unto the suppl@@ ication of thy people Israel , to hear@@ ken unto them in all that they call for unto thee .
for thou did@@ st separate them from among all the people of the earth , to be th@@ ine inheritance , as thou sp@@ ak@@ est by the hand of Moses thy servant , when thou br@@ ough@@ test our fathers out of Egypt , O Lord GO@@ D .
blessed be the LORD , that hath given rest unto his people Israel , according to all that he promised : there hath not failed one word of all his good promise , which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant .
that he may incl@@ ine our hearts unto him , to walk in all his ways , and to keep his commandments , and his statutes , and his judgments , which he commanded our fathers .
let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God , to walk in his statutes , and to keep his commandments , as at this day .
and Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings , which he offered unto the LORD , two and twenty thousand ox@@ en , and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep . so the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD .
and at that time Solomon held a feast , and all Israel with him , a great congregation , from the entering in of Ham@@ ath unto the river of Egypt , before the LORD our God , seven days and seven days , even fourteen days .
on the eighth day he sent the people away : and they blessed the king , and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant , and for Israel his people .
then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever , as I promised to David thy father , saying , There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel .
but if ye shall at all turn from following me , ye or your children , and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you , but go and serve other gods , and worship them :
and at this house , which is high , every one that pass@@ eth by it shall be astonished , and shall h@@ iss ; and they shall say , Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land , and to this house ?
( now Hir@@ am the king of Ty@@ re had furnished Solomon with c@@ edar trees and f@@ ir trees , and with gold , according to all his desire , ) that then king Solomon gave Hir@@ am twenty cities in the land of Gal@@ ilee .
and this is the reason of the lev@@ y which king Solomon raised ; for to build the house of the LORD , and his own house , and Mill@@ o , and the wall of Jerusalem , and Haz@@ or , and Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do , and Ge@@ zer .
for Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt had gone up , and taken Ge@@ zer , and burnt it with fire , and sl@@ ain the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites that d@@ wel@@ t in the city , and given it for a present unto his daughter , Solomon 's wife .
and all the people that were left of the A@@ mor@@ ites , Hit@@ ti@@ tes , Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ites , Hi@@ v@@ ites , and Je@@ bus@@ ites , which were not of the children of Israel ,
but of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bond@@ men : but they were men of war , and his servants , and his princes , and his cap@@ tains , and rulers of his ch@@ ari@@ ots , and his hor@@ sem@@ en .
but Phar@@ aoh 's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her : then did he build Mill@@ o .
and three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD , and he burnt inc@@ ense upon the altar that was before the LORD . so he finished the house .
and king Solomon made a navy of ships in E@@ z@@ ion @@@ -@@ @ Ge@@ ber , which is beside E@@ lo@@ th , on the shore of the Red sea , in the land of E@@ dom .
and Hir@@ am sent in the navy his servants , ship@@ men that had knowledge of the sea , with the servants of Solomon .
and they came to O@@ ph@@ ir , and fetched from th@@ ence gold , four hundred and twenty talents , and brought it to king Solomon .
and she came to Jerusalem with a very great train , with cam@@ els that bare spices , and very much gold , and precious stones : and when she was come to Solomon , she commun@@ ed with him of all that was in her heart .
and when the queen of She@@ ba had seen all Solomon 's wisdom , and the house that he had built ,
and the meat of his table , and the sitting of his servants , and the attendance of his ministers , and their app@@ arel , and his cu@@ p@@ bearers , and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD ; there was no more spirit in her .
and she said to the king , It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom .
blessed be the LORD thy God , which delighted in thee , to set thee on the throne of Israel : because the LORD loved Israel for ever , therefore made he thee king , to do judgment and justice .
and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold , and of spices very great store , and precious stones : there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of She@@ ba gave to king Solomon .
and the navy also of Hir@@ am , that brought gold from O@@ ph@@ ir , brought in from O@@ ph@@ ir great plenty of al@@ mu@@ g trees , and precious stones .
and the king made of the al@@ mu@@ g trees pillars for the house of the LORD , and for the king 's house , har@@ ps also and p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies for singers : there came no such al@@ mu@@ g trees , nor were seen unto this day .
beside that he had of the merchan@@ t@@ men , and of the traff@@ ick of the sp@@ ice merchants , and of all the kings of Arabia , and of the governors of the country .
and he made three hundred shi@@ elds of beaten gold ; three pound of gold went to one shield : and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon .
the throne had six steps , and the top of the throne was round behind : and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat , and two lions stood beside the stays .
and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps : there was not the like made in any kingdom .
and Solomon gathered together ch@@ ari@@ ots and hor@@ sem@@ en : and he had a thousand and four hundred ch@@ ari@@ ots , and twelve thousand hor@@ sem@@ en , whom he bestowed in the cities for ch@@ ari@@ ots , and with the king at Jerusalem .
but king Solomon loved many strange women , together with the daughter of Phar@@ aoh , women of the Mo@@ ab@@ ites , Am@@ mon@@ ites , E@@ dom@@ ites , Z@@ id@@ onians , and Hit@@ ti@@ tes ;
for it came to pass , when Solomon was old , that his wives turned away his heart after other gods : and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God , as was the heart of David his father .
and had commanded him concerning this thing , that he should not go after other gods : but he kept not that which the LORD commanded .
W@@ herefore the LORD said unto Solomon , for@@ as@@ much as this is done of thee , and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes , which I have commanded thee , I will surely ren@@ d the kingdom from thee , and will give it to thy servant .
notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father 's sake : but I will ren@@ d it out of the hand of thy son .
How@@ be@@ it I will not ren@@ d away all the kingdom ; but will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant 's sake , and for Jerusalem 's sake which I have chosen .
and they arose out of Mi@@ dian , and came to Par@@ an : and they took men with them out of Par@@ an , and they came to Egypt , unto Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt ; which gave him an house , and appointed him vic@@ tu@@ als , and gave him land .
and had@@ ad found great favour in the sight of Phar@@ aoh , so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife , the sister of Tah@@ pen@@ es the queen .
and the sister of Tah@@ pen@@ es bare him Gen@@ ub@@ ath his son , whom Tah@@ pen@@ es we@@ an@@ ed in Phar@@ aoh 's house : and Gen@@ ub@@ ath was in Phar@@ aoh 's household among the sons of Phar@@ aoh .
and when had@@ ad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers , and that Jo@@ ab the captain of the host was dead , had@@ ad said to Phar@@ aoh , Let me depart , that I may go to mine own country .
then Phar@@ aoh said unto him , But what hast thou lacked with me , that , behold , thou see@@ k@@ est to go to th@@ ine own country ? and he answered , No@@ thing : How@@ be@@ it let me go in any wise .
and he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon , beside the mis@@ chief that had@@ ad did : and he ab@@ hor@@ red Israel , and re@@ igned over Syria .
and J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , an E@@ ph@@ ra@@ th@@ ite of Zer@@ eda , Solomon 's servant , whose mother 's name was Zer@@ u@@ ah , a widow woman , even he lifted up his hand against the king .
and this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king : Solomon built Mill@@ o , and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father .
and the man J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am was a mighty man of val@@ our : and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industri@@ ous , he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph .
and it came to pass at that time when J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am went out of Jerusalem , that the prophet A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite found him in the way ; and he had cl@@ ad himself with a new garment ; and they two were alone in the field :
and he said to J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am , Take thee ten pieces : for thus sa@@ ith the LORD , the God of Israel , Be@@ hold , I will ren@@ d the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon , and will give ten tribes to thee :
Solomon sought therefore to kill J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am . and J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am arose , and fled into Egypt , unto Sh@@ is@@ hak king of Egypt , and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon .
and king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am consulted with the old men , that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived , and said , How do ye advise that I may answer this people ?
and they sp@@ ake unto him , saying , If thou wil@@ t be a servant unto this people this day , and wil@@ t serve them , and answer them , and speak good words to them , then they will be thy servants for ever .
but he for@@ s@@ ook the counsel of the old men , which they had given him , and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him , and which stood before him :
and he said unto them , What counsel give ye that we may answer this people , who have spoken to me , saying , Make the y@@ oke which thy father did put upon us lighter ?
and now whereas my father did L@@ ade you with a heavy y@@ oke , I will add to your y@@ oke : my father hath ch@@ asti@@ sed you with whi@@ ps , but I will ch@@ as@@ tise you with scor@@ pi@@ ons .
and sp@@ ake to them after the counsel of the young men , saying , My father made your y@@ oke heavy , and I will add to your y@@ oke : my father also ch@@ asti@@ sed you with whi@@ ps , but I will ch@@ as@@ tise you with scor@@ pi@@ ons .
W@@ herefore the king hear@@ k@@ ened not unto the people ; for the cause was from the LORD , that he might perform his saying , which the LORD sp@@ ake by A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite unto J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat .
and when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am was come to Jerusalem , he assembled all the house of Jud@@ ah , with the tribe of Benjamin , an hundred and four@@ score thousand chosen men , which were warriors , to fight against the house of Israel , to bring the kingdom again to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am the son of Solomon .
and he made an house of high places , and made priests of the lowest of the people , which were not of the sons of Lev@@ i .
so he offered upon the altar which he had made in Be@@ the@@ l the fif@@ teenth day of the eighth month , even in the month which he had devised of his own heart ; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel : and he offered upon the altar , and burnt inc@@ ense .
and he gave a sign the same day , saying , This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken ; Be@@ hold , the altar shall be rent , and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out .
and the man of God said unto the king , If thou wil@@ t give me half th@@ ine house , I will not go in with thee , neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place :
for so was it charged me by the word of the LORD , saying , E@@ at no bread , nor drink water , nor turn again by the same way that thou cam@@ est .
now there d@@ wel@@ t an old prophet in Be@@ the@@ l ; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Be@@ the@@ l : the words which he had spoken unto the king , them they told also to their father .
and went after the man of God , and found him sitting under an oak : and he said unto him , Art thou the man of God that cam@@ est from Jud@@ ah ? and he said , I am .
for it was said to me by the word of the LORD , Th@@ ou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there , nor turn again to go by the way that thou cam@@ est .
and he cried unto the man of God that came from Jud@@ ah , saying , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , for@@ as@@ much as thou hast dis@@ obeyed the mouth of the LORD , and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee ,
but cam@@ est back , and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place , of the which the LORD did say to thee , E@@ at no bread , and drink no water ; thy car@@ case shall not come unto the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re of thy fathers .
and when he was gone , a lion met him by the way , and sle@@ w him : and his car@@ case was cast in the way , and the ass stood by it , the lion also stood by the car@@ case .
and , behold , men passed by , and saw the car@@ case cast in the way , and the lion standing by the car@@ case : and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet d@@ wel@@ t .
and he sp@@ ake to his sons , saying , Sadd@@ le me the ass . and they sadd@@ led him .
and the prophet took up the car@@ case of the man of God , and laid it upon the ass , and brought it back : and the old prophet came to the city , to mour@@ n and to bury him .
and he laid his car@@ case in his own grave ; and they mour@@ ned over him , saying , Al@@ as , my brother !
and J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am 's wife did so , and arose , and went to Sh@@ il@@ oh , and came to the house of A@@ hij@@ ah . but A@@ hij@@ ah could not see ; for his eyes were set by reason of his age .
go , tell J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD God of Israel , for@@ as@@ much as I exalted thee from among the people , and made thee prince over my people Israel ,
but hast done evil above all that were before thee : for thou hast gone and made thee other gods , and mol@@ ten images , to provoke me to anger , and hast cast me behind thy back :
him that Di@@ eth of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am in the city shall the dogs eat ; and him that Di@@ eth in the field shall the f@@ ow@@ ls of the air eat : for the LORD hath spoken it .
and all Israel shall mour@@ n for him , and bury him : for he only of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am shall come to the grave , because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am .
moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel , who shall cut off the house of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am that day : but what ? even now .
and he shall give Israel up because of the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am , who did sin , and who made Israel to sin .
and they buried him ; and all Israel mour@@ ned for him , according to the word of the LORD , which he sp@@ ake by the hand of his servant A@@ hij@@ ah the prophet .
for they also built them high places , and images , and gro@@ ves , on every high hill , and under every green tree .
and there were also so@@ dom@@ ites in the land : and they did according to all the ab@@ om@@ inations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel .
and king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made in their stead br@@ as@@ en shi@@ elds , and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard , which kept the door of the king 's house .
and Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David . and his mother 's name was Na@@ am@@ ah an Am@@ monit@@ ess . and A@@ bi@@ jam his son re@@ igned in his stead .
and he walked in all the sins of his father , which he had done before him : and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God , as the heart of David his father .
nevertheless for David 's sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem , to set up his son after him , and to establish Jerusalem :
because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD , and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life , save only in the matter of Uri@@ ah the Hit@@ tite .
and forty and one years re@@ igned he in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Ma@@ acha@@ h , the daughter of Ab@@ is@@ hal@@ om .
and he took away the so@@ dom@@ ites out of the land , and removed all the idols that his fathers had made .
and also Ma@@ acha@@ h his mother , even her he removed from being queen , because she had made an idol in a gro@@ ve ; and As@@ a destroyed her idol , and burnt it by the bro@@ ok K@@ id@@ ron .
and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated , and the things which himself had dedicated , into the house of the LORD , silver , and gold , and vessels .
so Ben @@@ -@@ @ had@@ ad hear@@ k@@ ened unto king As@@ a , and sent the cap@@ tains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel , and smo@@ te I@@ j@@ on , and Dan , and A@@ bel @@@ -@@ @ B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ ma@@ acha@@ h , and all Cin@@ ner@@ o@@ th , with all the land of N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i .
then king As@@ a made a pro@@ clamation throughout all Jud@@ ah ; none was exemp@@ ted : and they took away the stones of Ram@@ ah , and the timber thereof , where@@ with Ba@@ asha had buil@@ ded ; and king As@@ a built with them Ge@@ ba of Benjamin , and M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h .
and he did evil in the sight of the LORD , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin where@@ with he made Israel to sin .
and Ba@@ asha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah , of the house of Is@@ sac@@ har , con@@ spi@@ red against him ; and Ba@@ asha smo@@ te him at Gi@@ b@@ be@@ thon , which belonged to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ; for Nad@@ ab and all Israel laid siege to Gi@@ b@@ be@@ thon .
because of the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am which he sin@@ ned , and which he made Israel sin , by his provocation where@@ with he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger .
and he did evil in the sight of the LORD , and walked in the way of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am , and in his sin where@@ with he made Israel to sin .
behold , I will take away the post@@ er@@ ity of Ba@@ asha , and the post@@ er@@ ity of his house ; and will make thy house like the house of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat .
him that Di@@ eth of Ba@@ asha in the city shall the dogs eat ; and him that Di@@ eth of his in the fields shall the f@@ ow@@ ls of the air eat .
and his servant Zim@@ ri , captain of half his ch@@ ari@@ ots , con@@ spi@@ red against him , as he was in Tir@@ z@@ ah , drinking himself drunk in the house of Ar@@ za ste@@ ward of his house in Tir@@ z@@ ah .
and Zim@@ ri went in and smo@@ te him , and killed him , in the twenty and seventh year of As@@ a king of Jud@@ ah , and re@@ igned in his stead .
thus did Zim@@ ri destroy all the house of Ba@@ asha , according to the word of the LORD , which he sp@@ ake against Ba@@ asha by Je@@ hu the prophet ,
for all the sins of Ba@@ asha , and the sins of E@@ lah his son , by which they sin@@ ned , and by which they made Israel to sin , in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their van@@ ities .
in the twenty and seventh year of As@@ a king of Jud@@ ah did Zim@@ ri reign seven days in Tir@@ z@@ ah . and the people were enc@@ amped against Gi@@ b@@ be@@ thon , which belonged to the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and the people that were enc@@ amped heard say , Zim@@ ri hath con@@ spi@@ red , and hath also sl@@ ain the king : W@@ herefore all Israel made Om@@ ri , the captain of the host , king over Israel that day in the camp .
then were the people of Israel divided into two parts : half of the people followed Ti@@ b@@ ni the son of G@@ in@@ ath , to make him king ; and half followed Om@@ ri .
and he bought the hill Sam@@ aria of Sh@@ em@@ er for two talents of silver , and built on the hill , and called the name of the city which he built , after the name of Sh@@ em@@ er , owner of the hill , Sam@@ aria .
but Om@@ ri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD , and did worse than all that were before him .
for he walked in all the way of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , and in his sin where@@ with he made Israel to sin , to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their van@@ ities .
and in the thirty and eighth year of As@@ a king of Jud@@ ah began A@@ hab the son of Om@@ ri to reign over Israel : and A@@ hab the son of Om@@ ri re@@ igned over Israel in Sam@@ aria twenty and two years .
in his days did Hi@@ el the Beth@@ elite build Jer@@ ich@@ o : he laid the foundation thereof in A@@ bir@@ am his fir@@ st@@ born , and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Se@@ gu@@ b , according to the word of the LORD , which he sp@@ ake by Joshua the son of N@@ un .
and Elijah the T@@ ish@@ bite , who was of the inhabitants of Gil@@ e@@ ad , said unto A@@ hab , As the LORD God of Israel liv@@ eth , before whom I stand , there shall not be de@@ w nor rain these years , but according to my word .
so he went and did according unto the word of the LORD : for he went and d@@ wel@@ t by the bro@@ ok Cher@@ ith , that is before Jordan .
and as she was going to fetch it , he called to her , and said , B@@ ring me , I pray thee , a mor@@ sel of bread in th@@ ine hand .
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD God of Israel , The barrel of meal shall not waste , neither shall the cr@@ use of oil fail , until the day that the LORD sen@@ det@@ h rain upon the earth .
and the barrel of meal wasted not , neither did the cr@@ use of oil fail , according to the word of the LORD , which he sp@@ ake by Elijah .
and he said unto her , Gi@@ ve me thy son . and he took him out of her bos@@ om , and carried him up into a lo@@ ft , where he ab@@ ode , and laid him upon his own bed .
and the LORD heard the voice of Elijah ; and the soul of the child came into him again , and he revived .
and Elijah took the child , and brought him down out of the chamber into the house , and delivered him unto his mother : and Elijah said , See , thy son liv@@ eth .
and the woman said to Elijah , Now by this I know that thou art a man of God , and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth .
and A@@ hab called Ob@@ adi@@ ah , which was the governor of his house . ( now Ob@@ adi@@ ah feared the LORD greatly :
for it was so , when J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel cut off the prophets of the LORD , that Ob@@ adi@@ ah took an hundred prophets , and hid them by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water . )
and A@@ hab said unto Ob@@ adi@@ ah , Go into the land , unto all foun@@ tains of water , and unto all bro@@ o@@ ks : per@@ adventure we may find grass to save the horses and mul@@ es alive , that we lose not all the beasts .
was it not told my lord what I did when J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel sle@@ w the prophets of the LORD , how I hid an hundred men of the LORD 's prophets by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water ?
and Elijah said , As the LORD of hosts liv@@ eth , before whom I stand , I will surely sh@@ ew myself unto him to day .
and it came to pass , when A@@ hab saw Elijah , that A@@ hab said unto him , Art thou he that troubl@@ eth Israel ?
and he answered , I have not troubled Israel ; but thou , and thy father 's house , in that ye have for@@ s@@ aken the commandments of the LORD , and thou hast followed Ba@@ ali@@ m .
now therefore send , and gather to me all Israel unto mount Car@@ me@@ l , and the prophets of Ba@@ al four hundred and fifty , and the prophets of the gro@@ ves four hundred , which eat at J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel 's table .
and call ye on the name of your gods , and I will call on the name of the LORD : and the God that answ@@ er@@ eth by fire , let him be God . and all the people answered and said , It is well spoken .
and Elijah said unto the prophets of Ba@@ al , Choose you one bul@@ lock for yourselves , and dress it first ; for ye are many ; and call on the name of your gods , but put no fire under .
then the fire of the LORD fell , and consumed the burnt sacrifice , and the wood , and the stones , and the dust , and lic@@ ked up the water that was in the t@@ rench .
and Elijah said unto them , Take the prophets of Ba@@ al ; let not one of them escape . and they took them : and Elijah brought them down to the bro@@ ok K@@ ish@@ on , and sle@@ w them there .
and Elijah said unto A@@ hab , Get thee up , eat and drink ; for there is a sound of abundance of rain .
so A@@ hab went up to eat and to drink . and Elijah went up to the top of Car@@ me@@ l ; and he cast himself down upon the earth , and put his face between his knees ,
and said to his servant , Go up now , look toward the sea . and he went up , and looked , and said , There is nothing . and he said , Go again seven times .
and it came to pass in the mean while , that the heaven was black with clouds and wind , and there was a great rain . and A@@ hab rode , and went to J@@ ez@@ re@@ el .
and the hand of the LORD was on Elijah ; and he gir@@ ded up his lo@@ ins , and ran before A@@ hab to the entrance of J@@ ez@@ re@@ el .
and as he lay and slept under a j@@ uni@@ per tree , behold , then an angel touched him , and said unto him , A@@ rise and eat .
and the angel of the LORD came again the second time , and touched him , and said , A@@ rise and eat ; because the journey is too great for thee .
and he came thi@@ ther unto a cave , and lodged there ; and , behold , the word of the LORD came to him , and he said unto him , What do@@ est thou here , Elijah ?
and he said , I have been very jeal@@ ous for the LORD God of hosts : for the children of Israel have for@@ s@@ aken thy covenant , thrown down th@@ ine al@@ t@@ ars , and sl@@ ain thy prophets with the sword ; and I , even I only , am left ; and they seek my life , to take it away .
and the LORD said unto him , Go , return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus : and when thou com@@ est , ano@@ int Haz@@ ael to be king over Syria :
and Je@@ hu the son of N@@ im@@ sh@@ i shalt thou ano@@ int to be king over Israel : and Elis@@ ha the son of Sha@@ ph@@ at of A@@ bel @@@ -@@ @ me@@ hol@@ ah shalt thou ano@@ int to be prophet in thy room .
and he left the ox@@ en , and ran after Elijah , and said , Let me , I pray thee , kiss my father and my mother , and then I will follow thee . and he said unto him , Go back again : for what have I done to thee ?
and Ben @@@ -@@ @ had@@ ad the king of Syria gathered all his host together : and there were thirty and two kings with him , and horses , and ch@@ ari@@ ots : and he went up and be@@ sieg@@ ed Sam@@ aria , and war@@ red against it .
and the king of Israel answered and said , My lord , O king , according to thy saying , I am th@@ ine , and all that I have .
and the messengers came again , and said , Th@@ us spe@@ ak@@ eth Ben @@@ -@@ @ had@@ ad , saying , Although I have sent unto thee , saying , Th@@ ou shalt deliver me thy silver , and thy gold , and thy wives , and thy children ;
and Ben @@@ -@@ @ had@@ ad sent unto him , and said , The gods do so unto me , and more also , if the dust of Sam@@ aria shall suffice for hand@@ ful@@ s for all the people that follow me .
and A@@ hab said , By whom ? and he said , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces . then he said , Who shall order the battle ? and he answered , Th@@ ou .
and they sle@@ w every one his man : and the Syrians fled ; and Israel pursued them : and Ben @@@ -@@ @ had@@ ad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the hor@@ sem@@ en .
and the king of Israel went out , and smo@@ te the horses and ch@@ ari@@ ots , and sle@@ w the Syrians with a great slaughter .
and the prophet came to the king of Israel , and said unto him , Go , strengthen thy self , and mark , and see what thou do@@ est : for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee .
and the children of Israel were numbered , and were all present , and went against them : and the children of Israel pit@@ ched before them like two little f@@ locks of kids ; but the Syrians filled the country .
then said he unto him , Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD , behold , as soon as thou art departed from me , a lion shall sl@@ ay thee . and as soon as he was departed from him , a lion found him , and sle@@ w him .
then he found another man , and said , Sm@@ ite me , I pray thee . and the man smo@@ te him , so that in sm@@ iting he wounded him .
and he ha@@ sted , and took the ashes away from his face ; and the king of Israel discer@@ ned him that he was of the prophets .
and he said unto him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , Because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction , therefore thy life shall go for his life , and thy people for his people .
and Nab@@ o@@ th said to A@@ hab , The LORD forbid it me , that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee .
so she wrote letters in A@@ hab 's name , and sealed them with his seal , and sent the letters unto the elders and to the no@@ bles that were in his city , dwelling with Nab@@ o@@ th .
and the men of his city , even the elders and the no@@ bles who were the inhabitants in his city , did as J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel had sent unto them , and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them .
and it came to pass , when A@@ hab heard that Nab@@ o@@ th was dead , that A@@ hab rose up to go down to the viney@@ ard of Nab@@ o@@ th the J@@ ez@@ re@@ elite , to take possession of it .
and A@@ hab said to Elijah , H@@ ast thou found me , O mine enemy ? and he answered , I have found thee : because thou hast sold thy@@ self to work evil in the sight of the LORD .
behold , I will bring evil upon thee , and will take away thy post@@ er@@ ity , and will cut off from A@@ hab him that p@@ is@@ set@@ h against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in Israel ,
and will make th@@ ine house like the house of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , and like the house of Ba@@ asha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah , for the provocation where@@ with thou hast provoked me to anger , and made Israel to sin .
and of J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel also sp@@ ake the LORD , saying , The dogs shall eat J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel by the wall of J@@ ez@@ re@@ el .
him that Di@@ eth of A@@ hab in the city the dogs shall eat ; and him that Di@@ eth in the field shall the f@@ ow@@ ls of the air eat .
and it came to pass , when A@@ hab heard those words , that he rent his clothes , and put s@@ ack@@ cloth upon his flesh , and fast@@ ed , and lay in s@@ ack@@ cloth , and went softly .
Se@@ est thou how A@@ hab hum@@ bl@@ eth himself before me ? because he hum@@ bl@@ eth himself before me , I will not bring the evil in his days : but in his son 's days will I bring the evil upon his house .
and the king of Israel said unto his servants , Know ye that Ram@@ o@@ th in Gil@@ e@@ ad is ours , and we be still , and take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria ?
and the king of Israel and Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Jud@@ ah sat each on his throne , having put on their robes , in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Sam@@ aria ; and all the prophets prophe@@ si@@ ed before them .
and Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the son of Chen@@ a@@ an@@ ah made him horns of iron : and he said , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , With these shalt thou push the Syrians , until thou have consumed them .
and all the prophets prophe@@ si@@ ed so , saying , Go up to Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ Gil@@ e@@ ad , and prosper : for the LORD shall deliver it into the king 's hand .
and the king said unto him , How many times shall I ad@@ j@@ ure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD ?
and he said , He@@ ar thou therefore the word of the LORD : I saw the LORD sitting on his throne , and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left .
and the LORD said , Who shall persuade A@@ hab , that he may go up and fall at Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ Gil@@ e@@ ad ? and one said on this manner , and another said on that manner .
now therefore , behold , the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets , and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee .
and the king of Israel said , Take Mic@@ aiah , and carry him back unto Am@@ on the governor of the city , and to Jo@@ ash the king 's son ;
and say , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the king , P@@ ut this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of afflic@@ tion and with water of afflic@@ tion , until I come in peace .
and Mic@@ aiah said , If thou return at all in peace , the LORD hath not spoken by me . and he said , hear@@ ken , O people , every one of you .
and the king of Israel said unto Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , I will disguise myself , and enter into the battle ; but put thou on thy robes . and the king of Israel disguised himself , and went into the battle .
and it came to pass , when the cap@@ tains of the ch@@ ari@@ ots saw Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , that they said , Su@@ rely it is the king of Israel . and they turned aside to fight against him : and Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at cried out .
and the battle increased that day : and the king was stayed up in his ch@@ ari@@ ot against the Syrians , and died at even : and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the ch@@ ari@@ ot .
and one washed the ch@@ ari@@ ot in the pool of Sam@@ aria ; and the dogs lic@@ ked up his blood ; and they washed his arm@@ our ; according unto the word of the LORD which he sp@@ ake .
now the rest of the acts of A@@ hab , and all that he did , and the iv@@ ory house which he made , and all the cities that he built , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ icles of the kings of Israel ?
Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at was thirty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned twenty and five years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Az@@ ub@@ ah the daughter of Sh@@ il@@ hi .
and the remn@@ ant of the so@@ dom@@ ites , which remained in the days of his father As@@ a , he took out of the land .
for he served Ba@@ al , and wor@@ shipped him , and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel , according to all that his father had done .
and A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah fell down through a lat@@ tice in his upper chamber that was in Sam@@ aria , and was sick : and he sent messengers , and said unto them , Go , inqu@@ ire of Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ ze@@ bu@@ b the god of Ek@@ ron whether I shall recover of this disease .
and he said unto them , What manner of man was he which came up to meet you , and told you these words ?
and they answered him , He was an hair@@ y man , and gir@@ t with a gir@@ dle of leather about his lo@@ ins . and he said , It is Elijah the T@@ ish@@ bite .
and Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty , If I be a man of God , then let fire come down from heaven , and consume thee and thy fifty . and there came down fire from heaven , and consumed him and his fifty .
again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty . and he answered and said unto him , O man of God , thus hath the king said , Come down quickly .
and Elijah answered and said unto them , If I be a man of God , let fire come down from heaven , and consume thee and thy fifty . and the fire of God came down from heaven , and consumed him and his fifty .
behold , there came fire down from heaven , and burnt up the two cap@@ tains of the former fif@@ ties with their fif@@ ties : therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight .
and the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah , Go down with him : be not afraid of him . and he arose , and went down with him unto the king .
and it came to pass , when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whir@@ l@@ wind , that Elijah went with Elis@@ ha from Gil@@ gal .
and Elijah said unto Elis@@ ha , Tar@@ ry here , I pray thee ; for the LORD hath sent me to Be@@ the@@ l . and Elis@@ ha said unto him , As the LORD liv@@ eth , and as thy soul liv@@ eth , I will not leave thee . so they went down to Be@@ the@@ l .
and the sons of the prophets that were at Be@@ the@@ l came forth to Elis@@ ha , and said unto him , Know@@ est thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day ? and he said , Y@@ ea , I know it ; hold ye your peace .
and Elijah said unto him , Elis@@ ha , tar@@ ry here , I pray thee ; for the LORD hath sent me to Jer@@ ich@@ o . and he said , As the LORD liv@@ eth , and as thy soul liv@@ eth , I will not leave thee . so they came to Jer@@ ich@@ o .
and the sons of the prophets that were at Jer@@ ich@@ o came to Elis@@ ha , and said unto him , Know@@ est thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day ? and he answered , Y@@ ea , I know it ; hold ye your peace .
and Elijah said unto him , Tar@@ ry , I pray thee , here ; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan . and he said , As the LORD liv@@ eth , and as thy soul liv@@ eth , I will not leave thee . and they two went on .
and fifty men of the sons of the prophets went , and stood to view af@@ ar off : and they two stood by Jordan .
and Elijah took his mantle , and wrapped it together , and smo@@ te the waters , and they were divided hi@@ ther and thi@@ ther , so that they two went over on dry ground .
and it came to pass , when they were gone over , that Elijah said unto Elis@@ ha , As@@ k what I shall do for thee , before I be taken away from thee . and Elis@@ ha said , I pray thee , let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me .
and he said , Th@@ ou hast asked a hard thing : nevertheless , if thou see me when I am taken from thee , it shall be so unto thee ; but if not , it shall not be so .
and Elis@@ ha saw it , and he cried , My father , my father , the ch@@ ari@@ ot of Israel , and the hor@@ sem@@ en thereof . and he saw him no more : and he took hold of his own clothes , and rent them in two pieces .
he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him , and went back , and stood by the bank of Jordan ;
and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jer@@ ich@@ o saw him , they said , The spirit of Elijah do@@ th rest on Elis@@ ha . and they came to meet him , and bowed themselves to the ground before him .
and he went forth unto the spring of the waters , and cast the salt in there , and said , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , I have healed these waters ; there shall not be from th@@ ence any more death or bar@@ ren land .
and he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD ; but not like his father , and like his mother : for he put away the image of Ba@@ al that his father had made .
and Mes@@ ha king of Mo@@ ab was a she@@ ep@@ master , and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lam@@ bs , and an hundred thousand r@@ ams , with the wool .
so the king of Israel went , and the king of Jud@@ ah , and the king of E@@ dom : and they fetched a compass of seven days ' journey : and there was no water for the host , and for the cattle that followed them .
and the king of Israel said , Al@@ as ! that the LORD hath called these three kings together , to deliver them into the hand of Mo@@ ab !
but Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at said , Is there not here a prophet of the LORD , that we may inqu@@ ire of the LORD by him ? and one of the king of Israel 's servants answered and said , Here is Elis@@ ha the son of Sha@@ ph@@ at , which poured water on the hands of Elijah .
and Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at said , The word of the LORD is with him . so the king of Israel and Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at and the king of E@@ dom went down to him .
and Elis@@ ha said , As the LORD of hosts liv@@ eth , before whom I stand , surely , were it not that I regard the presence of Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the king of Jud@@ ah , I would not look toward thee , nor see thee .
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Y@@ e shall not see wind , neither shall ye see rain ; yet that valley shall be filled with water , that ye may drink , both ye , and your cattle , and your beasts .
and ye shall sm@@ ite every f@@ enced city , and every choice city , and shall fell every good tree , and stop all wells of water , and mar every good piece of land with stones .
and when all the Mo@@ ab@@ ites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them , they gathered all that were able to put on arm@@ our , and upward , and stood in the border .
and they rose up early in the morning , and the sun shone upon the water , and the Mo@@ ab@@ ites saw the water on the other side as red as blood :
and they said , This is blood : the kings are surely sl@@ ain , and they have sm@@ it@@ ten one another : now therefore , Mo@@ ab , to the spoil .
and when they came to the camp of Israel , the Israel@@ ites rose up and smo@@ te the Mo@@ ab@@ ites , so that they fled before them : but they went forward sm@@ iting the Mo@@ ab@@ ites , even in their country .
and when the king of Mo@@ ab saw that the battle was too sore for him , he took with him seven hundred men that drew s@@ words , to break through even unto the king of E@@ dom : but they could not .
then he took his el@@ dest son that should have re@@ igned in his stead , and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall . and there was great indignation against Israel : and they departed from him , and returned to their own land .
and Elis@@ ha said unto her , What shall I do for thee ? tell me , what hast thou in the house ? and she said , Th@@ ine hand@@ maid hath not any thing in the house , save a pot of oil .
so she went from him , and shut the door upon her and upon her sons , who brought the vessels to her ; and she poured out .
and it fell on a day , that he came thi@@ ther , and he turned into the chamber , and lay there .
and he said , About this season , according to the time of life , thou shalt embrace a son . and she said , N@@ ay , my lord , thou man of God , do not lie unto th@@ ine hand@@ maid .
and he said , W@@ herefore wil@@ t thou go to him to day ? it is neither new moon , nor sab@@ bath . and she said , It shall be well .
and the mother of the child said , As the LORD liv@@ eth , and as thy soul liv@@ eth , I will not leave thee . and he arose , and followed her .
and Ge@@ haz@@ i passed on before them , and laid the staff upon the face of the child ; but there was neither voice , nor hearing . W@@ herefore he went again to meet him , and told him , saying , The child is not aw@@ aked .
and when Elis@@ ha was come into the house , behold , the child was dead , and laid upon his bed .
he went in therefore , and shut the door upon them tw@@ ain , and prayed unto the LORD .
and he went up , and lay upon the child , and put his mouth upon his mouth , and his eyes upon his eyes , and his hands upon his hands : and he stretched himself upon the child ; and the flesh of the child wa@@ xed warm .
then he returned , and walked in the house to and fro ; and went up , and stretched himself upon him : and the child sne@@ ezed seven times , and the child opened his eyes .
then she went in , and fell at his feet , and bowed herself to the ground , and took up her son , and went out .
and Elis@@ ha came again to Gil@@ gal : and there was a de@@ ar@@ th in the land ; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him : and he said unto his servant , Set on the great pot , and see@@ the pot@@ tage for the sons of the prophets .
but he said , Then bring meal . and he cast it into the pot ; and he said , P@@ our out for the people , that they may eat . and there was no harm in the pot .
and his serv@@ itor said , What , should I set this before an hundred men ? he said again , Gi@@ ve the people , that they may eat : for thus sa@@ ith the LORD , They shall eat , and shall leave thereof .
so he set it before them , and they did eat , and left thereof , according to the word of the LORD .
and the king of Syria said , Go to , go , and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel . and he departed , and took with him ten talents of silver , and six thousand pieces of gold , and ten changes of ra@@ iment .
and he brought the letter to the king of Israel , saying , Now when this letter is come unto thee , behold , I have there@@ with sent Na@@ aman my servant to thee , that thou may@@ est recover him of his le@@ pro@@ sy .
and it was so , when Elis@@ ha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes , that he sent to the king , saying , W@@ herefore hast thou rent thy clothes ? let him come now to me , and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel .
and Elis@@ ha sent a messenger unto him , saying , Go and wash in the Jordan seven times , and thy flesh shall come again to thee , and thou shalt be clean .
but Na@@ aman was w@@ ro@@ th , and went away , and said , Be@@ hold , I thought , He will surely come out to me , and stand , and call on the name of the LORD his God , and strike his hand over the place , and recover the le@@ per .
are not A@@ ban@@ a and Phar@@ par , rivers of Damascus , better than all the waters of Israel ? may I not wash in them , and be clean ? so he turned and went away in a rage .
then went he down , and di@@ pped himself seven times in Jordan , according to the saying of the man of God : and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child , and he was clean .
so Ge@@ haz@@ i followed after Na@@ aman . and when Na@@ aman saw him running after him , he lighted down from the ch@@ ari@@ ot to meet him , and said , Is all well ?
and when he came to the tower , he took them from their hand , and bestowed them in the house : and he let the men go , and they departed .
but he went in , and stood before his master . and Elis@@ ha said unto him , wh@@ ence com@@ est thou , Ge@@ haz@@ i ? and he said , Th@@ y servant went no whi@@ ther .
the le@@ pro@@ sy therefore of Na@@ aman shall cle@@ ave unto thee , and unto thy seed for ever . and he went out from his presence a le@@ per as white as snow .
and the sons of the prophets said unto Elis@@ ha , Be@@ hold now , the place where we dwell with thee is too str@@ ait for us .
and the man of God said , Where fell it ? and he sh@@ ew@@ ed him the place . and he cut down a stick , and cast it in thi@@ ther ; and the iron did swim .
therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing ; and he called his servants , and said unto them , Will ye not sh@@ ew me which of us is for the king of Israel ?
and he said , Go and spy where he is , that I may send and fetch him . and it was told him , saying , Be@@ hold , he is in Do@@ than .
and when the servant of the man of God was risen early , and gone forth , behold , an host comp@@ assed the city both with horses and ch@@ ari@@ ots . and his servant said unto him , Al@@ as , my master ! how shall we do ?
and he prepared great provision for them : and when they had eaten and drunk , he sent them away , and they went to their master . so the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel .
and he said , If the LORD do not help thee , wh@@ ence shall I help thee ? out of the bar@@ n@@ floor , or out of the win@@ ep@@ ress ?
and the king said unto her , What ail@@ eth thee ? and she answered , This woman said unto me , Gi@@ ve thy son , that we may eat him to day , and we will eat my son to mor@@ row .
and while he yet talked with them , behold , the messenger came down unto him : and he said , Be@@ hold , this evil is of the LORD ; what should I wait for the LORD any longer ?
and there were four le@@ pr@@ ous men at the entering in of the gate : and they said one to another , Why sit we here until we die ?
and they rose up in the tw@@ ilight , to go unto the camp of the Syrians : and when they were come to the utter@@ most part of the camp of Syria , behold , there was no man there .
and they went after them unto Jordan : and , lo , all the way was full of garments and vessels , which the Syrians had cast away in their ha@@ ste . and the messengers returned , and told the king .
and the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate : and the people tro@@ de upon him in the gate , and he died , as the man of God had said , who sp@@ ake when the king came down to him .
and the woman arose , and did after the saying of the man of God : and she went with her household , and so@@ jour@@ ned in the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines seven years .
and the king talked with Ge@@ haz@@ i the servant of the man of God , saying , Tell me , I pray thee , all the great things that Elis@@ ha hath done .
and Elis@@ ha came to Damascus ; and Ben @@@ -@@ @ had@@ ad the king of Syria was sick ; and it was told him , saying , The man of God is come hi@@ ther .
and the king said unto Haz@@ ael , Take a present in th@@ ine hand , and go , meet the man of God , and inqu@@ ire of the LORD by him , saying , Sh@@ all I recover of this disease ?
and Elis@@ ha said unto him , Go , say unto him , Th@@ ou may@@ est certainly recover : How@@ be@@ it the LORD hath sh@@ ew@@ ed me that he shall surely die .
and he settled his coun@@ tenance st@@ ed@@ fast@@ ly , until he was ashamed : and the man of God we@@ pt .
and Haz@@ ael said , But what , is thy servant a dog , that he should do this great thing ? and Elis@@ ha answered , The LORD hath sh@@ ew@@ ed me that thou shalt be king over Syria .
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , that he took a thick cloth , and di@@ pped it in water , and spread it on his face , so that he died : and Haz@@ ael re@@ igned in his stead .
and in the fifth year of Jor@@ am the son of A@@ hab king of Israel , Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at being then king of Jud@@ ah , Je@@ hor@@ am the son of Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at king of Jud@@ ah began to reign .
and he walked in the way of the kings of Israel , as did the house of A@@ hab : for the daughter of A@@ hab was his wife : and he did evil in the sight of the LORD .
so Jor@@ am went over to Z@@ air , and all the ch@@ ari@@ ots with him : and he rose by night , and smo@@ te the E@@ dom@@ ites which comp@@ assed him about , and the cap@@ tains of the ch@@ ari@@ ots : and the people fled into their tents .
in the twel@@ fth year of Jor@@ am the son of A@@ hab king of Israel did A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ hor@@ am king of Jud@@ ah begin to reign .
two and twenty years old was A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned one year in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Ath@@ ali@@ ah , the daughter of Om@@ ri king of Israel .
and Elis@@ ha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets , and said unto him , G@@ ird up thy lo@@ ins , and take this box of oil in th@@ ine hand , and go to Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ Gil@@ e@@ ad :
and when thou com@@ est thi@@ ther , look out there Je@@ hu the son of Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at the son of N@@ im@@ sh@@ i , and go in , and make him arise up from among his brethren , and carry him to an inner chamber ;
and he arose , and went into the house ; and he poured the oil on his head , and said unto him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD God of Israel , I have ano@@ inted thee king over the people of the LORD , even over Israel .
and thou shalt sm@@ ite the house of A@@ hab thy master , that I may av@@ enge the blood of my servants the prophets , and the blood of all the servants of the LORD , at the hand of J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel .
and I will make the house of A@@ hab like the house of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , and like the house of Ba@@ asha the son of A@@ hij@@ ah :
and the dogs shall eat J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel in the portion of J@@ ez@@ re@@ el , and there shall be none to bury her . and he opened the door , and fled .
then Je@@ hu came forth to the servants of his lord : and one said unto him , Is all well ? W@@ herefore came this mad fellow to thee ? and he said unto them , Y@@ e know the man , and his communication .
then they ha@@ sted , and took every man his garment , and put it under him on the top of the stairs , and blew with trum@@ pets , saying , Je@@ hu is king .
then he sent out a second on horse@@ back , which came to them , and said , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the king , Is it peace ? and Je@@ hu answered , What hast thou to do with peace ? turn thee behind me .
and the watch@@ man told , saying , He came even unto them , and com@@ eth not again : and the driving is like the driving of Je@@ hu the son of N@@ im@@ sh@@ i ; for he dri@@ v@@ eth fur@@ iously .
and Jor@@ am said , Make ready . and his ch@@ ari@@ ot was made ready . and Jor@@ am king of Israel and A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah went out , each in his ch@@ ari@@ ot , and they went out against Je@@ hu , and met him in the portion of Nab@@ o@@ th the J@@ ez@@ re@@ elite .
and it came to pass , when Jor@@ am saw Je@@ hu , that he said , Is it peace , Je@@ hu ? and he answered , What peace , so long as the wh@@ ore@@ doms of thy mother J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel and her wit@@ ch@@ crafts are so many ?
and Je@@ hu drew a bow with his full strength , and smo@@ te Je@@ hor@@ am between his arms , and the arrow went out at his heart , and he sunk down in his ch@@ ari@@ ot .
and when Je@@ hu was come to J@@ ez@@ re@@ el , J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel heard of it ; and she painted her face , and tired her head , and looked out at a window .
and he lifted up his face to the window , and said , Who is on my side ? who ? and there looked out to him two or three e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s .
and he said , Th@@ row her down . so they threw her down : and some of her blood was sprink@@ led on the wall , and on the horses : and he tro@@ de her under foot .
and when he was come in , he did eat and drink , and said , Go , see now this cur@@ sed woman , and bury her : for she is a king 's daughter .
and they went to bury her : but they found no more of her than the skull , and the feet , and the pal@@ ms of her hands .
W@@ herefore they came again , and told him . and he said , This is the word of the LORD , which he sp@@ ake by his servant Elijah the T@@ ish@@ bite , saying , In the portion of J@@ ez@@ re@@ el shall dogs eat the flesh of J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel :
and the car@@ case of J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel shall be as d@@ ung upon the face of the field in the portion of J@@ ez@@ re@@ el ; so that they shall not say , This is J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel .
and A@@ hab had seventy sons in Sam@@ aria . and Je@@ hu wrote letters , and sent to Sam@@ aria , unto the rulers of J@@ ez@@ re@@ el , to the elders , and to them that brought up A@@ hab 's children , saying ,
look even out the best and me@@ et@@ est of your master 's sons , and set him on his father 's throne , and fight for your master 's house .
and it came to pass , when the letter came to them , that they took the king 's sons , and sle@@ w seventy persons , and put their heads in bas@@ kets , and sent him them to J@@ ez@@ re@@ el .
and there came a messenger , and told him , saying , They have brought the heads of the king 's sons . and he said , L@@ ay ye them in two he@@ aps at the entering in of the gate until the morning .
and it came to pass in the morning , that he went out , and stood , and said to all the people , Y@@ e be righteous : behold , I con@@ spi@@ red against my master , and sle@@ w him : but who sle@@ w all these ?
know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the LORD , which the LORD sp@@ ake concerning the house of A@@ hab : for the LORD hath done that which he sp@@ ake by his servant Elijah .
and when he came to Sam@@ aria , he sle@@ w all that remained unto A@@ hab in Sam@@ aria , till he had destroyed him , according to the saying of the LORD , which he sp@@ ake to Elijah .
and Je@@ hu gathered all the people together , and said unto them , A@@ hab served Ba@@ al a little ; but Je@@ hu shall serve him much .
and Je@@ hu sent through all Israel : and all the worshi@@ ppers of Ba@@ al came , so that there was not a man left that came not . and they came into the house of Ba@@ al ; and the house of Ba@@ al was full from one end to another .
How@@ be@@ it from the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , who made Israel to sin , Je@@ hu departed not from after them , to w@@ it , the golden cal@@ ves that were in Be@@ the@@ l , and that were in Dan .
but Je@@ hu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart : for he departed not from the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am , which made Israel to sin .
from Jordan eastward , all the land of Gil@@ e@@ ad , the G@@ ad@@ ites , and the Re@@ ub@@ en@@ ites , and the Man@@ ass@@ ites , from A@@ ro@@ er , which is by the river Ar@@ non , even Gil@@ e@@ ad and Bash@@ an .
and the seventh year Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds , with the cap@@ tains and the guard , and brought them to him into the house of the LORD , and made a covenant with them , and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD , and sh@@ ew@@ ed them the king 's son .
and he commanded them , saying , This is the thing that ye shall do ; A third part of you that enter in on the sab@@ bath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king 's house ;
and two parts of all you that go forth on the sab@@ bath , even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king .
and the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , round about the king , from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple , along by the altar and the temple .
and he brought forth the king 's son , and put the crown upon him , and gave him the testimony ; and they made him king , and ano@@ inted him ; and they cl@@ apped their hands , and said , God save the king .
and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people that they should be the LORD 's people ; between the king also and the people .
in the seventh year of Je@@ hu Je@@ ho@@ ash began to reign ; and forty years re@@ igned he in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Zi@@ bi@@ ah of Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba .
let the priests take it to them , every man of his acquaintance : and let them repair the breaches of the house , wher@@ eso@@ ever any breach shall be found .
then king Je@@ ho@@ ash called for Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the priest , and the other priests , and said unto them , Why repair ye not the breaches of the house ? now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance , but deliver it for the breaches of the house .
and to mas@@ ons , and he@@ w@@ ers of stone , and to buy timber and he@@ wed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD , and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it .
How@@ be@@ it there were not made for the house of the LORD bow@@ ls of silver , sn@@ u@@ ff@@ ers , bas@@ ons , trum@@ pets , any vessels of gold , or vessels of silver , of the money that was brought into the house of the LORD :
for Jo@@ z@@ ac@@ har the son of Shim@@ e@@ ath , and Je@@ ho@@ z@@ abad the son of Sh@@ om@@ er , his servants , smo@@ te him , and he died ; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David : and Ama@@ zi@@ ah his son re@@ igned in his stead .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , and followed the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , which made Israel to sin ; he departed not there@@ from .
and the anger of the LORD was kind@@ led against Israel , and he delivered them into the hand of Haz@@ ael king of Syria , and into the hand of Ben @@@ -@@ @ had@@ ad the son of Haz@@ ael , all their days .
and Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz bes@@ ought the LORD , and the LORD hear@@ k@@ ened unto him : for he saw the oppression of Israel , because the king of Syria oppressed them .
( and the LORD gave Israel a s@@ avi@@ our , so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians : and the children of Israel d@@ wel@@ t in their tents , as be@@ fore@@ time .
nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am , who made Israel sin , but walked therein : and there remained the gro@@ ve also in Sam@@ aria . )
neither did he leave of the people to Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz but fifty hor@@ sem@@ en , and ten ch@@ ari@@ ots , and ten thousand foot@@ men ; for the king of Syria had destroyed them , and had made them like the dust by thresh@@ ing .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD ; he departed not from all the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , who made Israel sin : but he walked therein .
and the rest of the acts of Jo@@ ash , and all that he did , and his might where@@ with he fought against Ama@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ icles of the kings of Israel ?
now Elis@@ ha was fallen sick of his sickness where@@ of he died . and Jo@@ ash the king of Israel came down unto him , and we@@ pt over his face , and said , O my father , my father , the ch@@ ari@@ ot of Israel , and the hor@@ sem@@ en thereof .
and he said to the king of Israel , P@@ ut th@@ ine hand upon the bow . and he put his hand upon it : and Elis@@ ha put his hands upon the king 's hands .
and he said , Take the arrows . and he took them . and he said unto the king of Israel , Sm@@ ite upon the ground . and he smo@@ te thr@@ ice , and stayed .
and the man of God was w@@ ro@@ th with him , and said , Th@@ ou shoul@@ dest have sm@@ it@@ ten five or six times ; then had@@ st thou sm@@ it@@ ten Syria till thou had@@ st consumed it : whereas now thou shalt sm@@ ite Syria but thr@@ ice .
and Elis@@ ha died , and they buried him . and the bands of the Mo@@ ab@@ ites invaded the land at the coming in of the year .
and the LORD was gr@@ acious unto them , and had compassion on them , and had respect unto them , because of his covenant with Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , and would not destroy them , neither cast he them from his presence as yet .
and Je@@ ho@@ ash the son of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz took again out of the hand of Ben @@@ -@@ @ had@@ ad the son of Haz@@ ael the cities , which he had taken out of the hand of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz his father by war . three times did Jo@@ ash beat him , and recovered the cities of Israel .
he was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and re@@ igned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Je@@ ho@@ add@@ an of Jerusalem .
then Ama@@ zi@@ ah sent messengers to Je@@ ho@@ ash , the son of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz son of Je@@ hu , king of Israel , saying , Come , let us look one another in the face .
thou hast indeed sm@@ it@@ ten E@@ dom , and th@@ ine heart hath lifted thee up : glory of this , and tar@@ ry at home : for why shoul@@ dest thou med@@ dle to thy hurt , that thou shoul@@ dest fall , even thou , and Jud@@ ah with thee ?
but Ama@@ zi@@ ah would not hear . therefore Je@@ ho@@ ash king of Israel went up ; and he and Ama@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah looked one another in the face at B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ Sh@@ em@@ esh , which belong@@ eth to Jud@@ ah .
and Je@@ ho@@ ash king of Israel took Ama@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , the son of Je@@ ho@@ ash the son of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah , at B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ Sh@@ em@@ esh , and came to Jerusalem , and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im unto the corner gate , four hundred cub@@ its .
and he took all the gold and silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD , and in the treasures of the king 's house , and hostages , and returned to Sam@@ aria .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ ash which he did , and his might , and how he fought with Ama@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ icles of the kings of Israel ?
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD : he departed not from all the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , who made Israel to sin .
for the LORD saw the afflic@@ tion of Israel , that it was very bitter : for there was not any shut up , nor any left , nor any hel@@ per for Israel .
sixteen years old was he when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned two and fifty years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was J@@ ec@@ hol@@ i@@ ah of Jerusalem .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , according to all that his father Ama@@ zi@@ ah had done ;
save that the high places were not removed : the people sacrificed and burnt inc@@ ense still on the high places .
and the LORD smo@@ te the king , so that he was a le@@ per unto the day of his death , and d@@ wel@@ t in a several house . and Jo@@ th@@ am the king 's son was over the house , judging the people of the land .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , as his fathers had done : he departed not from the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , who made Israel to sin .
this was the word of the LORD which he sp@@ ake unto Je@@ hu , saying , Th@@ y sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth generation . and so it came to pass .
Sh@@ all@@ um the son of Jab@@ esh began to reign in the nine and thir@@ ti@@ eth year of Uz@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah ; and he re@@ igned a full month in Sam@@ aria .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD : he departed not all his days from the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , who made Israel to sin .
and Men@@ a@@ hem exac@@ ted the money of Israel , even of all the mighty men of wealth , of each man fifty she@@ k@@ els of silver , to give to the king of As@@ sy@@ ria . so the king of As@@ sy@@ ria turned back , and stayed not there in the land .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD : he departed not from the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , who made Israel to sin .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD : he departed not from the sins of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , who made Israel to sin .
and Hos@@ he@@ a the son of E@@ lah made a conspiracy against Pe@@ k@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah , and smo@@ te him , and sle@@ w him , and re@@ igned in his stead , in the twentieth year of Jo@@ th@@ am the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah .
five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned sixteen years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Jer@@ usha , the daughter of Z@@ ad@@ ok .
How@@ be@@ it the high places were not removed : the people sacrificed and burned inc@@ ense still in the high places . he built the higher gate of the house of the LORD .
twenty years old was A@@ haz when he began to reign , and re@@ igned sixteen years in Jerusalem , and did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD his God , like David his father .
and he sacrificed and burnt inc@@ ense in the high places , and on the hills , and under every green tree .
so A@@ haz sent messengers to Tig@@ l@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ pil@@ es@@ er king of As@@ sy@@ ria , saying , I am thy servant and thy son : come up , and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria , and out of the hand of the king of Israel , which rise up against me .
and the king of As@@ sy@@ ria hear@@ k@@ ened unto him : for the king of As@@ sy@@ ria went up against Damascus , and took it , and carried the people of it captive to K@@ ir , and sle@@ w Re@@ zin .
and he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering , and poured his drink offering , and sprink@@ led the blood of his peace offerings , upon the altar .
and he brought also the br@@ as@@ en altar , which was before the LORD , from the forefront of the house , from between the altar and the house of the LORD , and put it on the north side of the altar .
and king A@@ haz cut off the borders of the bases , and removed the lav@@ er from off them ; and took down the sea from off the br@@ as@@ en ox@@ en that were under it , and put it upon a pav@@ ement of stones .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , but not as the kings of Israel that were before him .
in the ninth year of Hos@@ he@@ a the king of As@@ sy@@ ria took Sam@@ aria , and carried Israel away into As@@ sy@@ ria , and placed them in Hal@@ ah and in Hab@@ or by the river of Go@@ zan , and in the cities of the Med@@ es .
for so it was , that the children of Israel had sin@@ ned against the LORD their God , which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt , from under the hand of Phar@@ o@@ ah king of Egypt , and had feared other gods ,
and walked in the statutes of the he@@ a@@ then , whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel , and of the kings of Israel , which they had made .
and there they burnt inc@@ ense in all the high places , as did the he@@ a@@ then whom the LORD carried away before them ; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger :
and they left all the commandments of the LORD their God , and made them mol@@ ten images , even two cal@@ ves , and made a gro@@ ve , and wor@@ shipped all the host of heaven , and served Ba@@ al .
and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire , and used div@@ ination and enchan@@ tments , and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD , to provoke him to anger .
therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel , and removed them out of his sight : there was none left but the tribe of Jud@@ ah only .
and the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel , and afflicted them , and delivered them into the hand of spo@@ il@@ ers , until he had cast them out of his sight .
for he rent Israel from the house of David ; and they made J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat king : and J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am dra@@ ve Israel from following the LORD , and made them sin a great sin .
and so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there , that they feared not the LORD : therefore the LORD sent lions among them , which sle@@ w some of them .
then the king of As@@ sy@@ ria commanded , saying , Car@@ ry thi@@ ther one of the priests whom ye brought from th@@ ence ; and let them go and dwell there , and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land .
How@@ be@@ it every nation made gods of their own , and put them in the houses of the high places which the Sam@@ ar@@ it@@ ans had made , every nation in their cities where@@ in they d@@ wel@@ t .
and the Av@@ ites made Ni@@ b@@ haz and Tar@@ ta@@ k , and the Sep@@ harv@@ ites burnt their children in fire to A@@ dram@@ m@@ elec@@ h and An@@ amm@@ elec@@ h , the gods of Sep@@ harv@@ aim .
so they feared the LORD , and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places , which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places .
unto this day they do after the former manners : they fear not the LORD , neither do they after their statutes , or after their ordin@@ ances , or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob , whom he named Israel ;
and the statutes , and the ordin@@ ances , and the law , and the commandment , which he wrote for you , ye shall observe to do for ever@@ more ; and ye shall not fear other gods .
but the LORD your God ye shall fear ; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies .
twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Ab@@ i , the daughter of Z@@ ach@@ ari@@ ah .
he removed the high places , and brake the images , and cut down the gro@@ ves , and brake in pieces the br@@ as@@ en ser@@ pent that Moses had made : for unto those days the children of Israel did burn inc@@ ense to it : and he called it Ne@@ h@@ ush@@ tan .
he smo@@ te the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , even unto Gaza , and the borders thereof , from the tower of the watch@@ men to the f@@ enced city .
and it came to pass in the fourth year of king He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , which was the seventh year of Hos@@ he@@ a son of E@@ lah king of Israel , that Shal@@ man@@ es@@ er king of As@@ sy@@ ria came up against Sam@@ aria , and be@@ sieg@@ ed it .
and at the end of three years they took it : even in the sixth year of He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , that is the ninth year of Hos@@ he@@ a king of Israel , Sam@@ aria was taken .
and the king of As@@ sy@@ ria did carry away Israel unto As@@ sy@@ ria , and put them in Hal@@ ah and in Hab@@ or by the river of Go@@ zan , and in the cities of the Med@@ es :
now in the four@@ teenth year of king He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah did Sen@@ n@@ ach@@ eri@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ria come up against all the f@@ enced cities of Jud@@ ah , and took them .
at that time did He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD , and from the pillars which He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah had over@@ laid , and gave it to the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
and when they had called to the king , there came out to them Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of Hil@@ ki@@ ah , which was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the scri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah the son of As@@ ap@@ h the recorder .
and R@@ ab @@@ -@@ @ sha@@ ke@@ h said unto them , Spe@@ ak ye now to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , What confidence is this where@@ in thou trust@@ est ?
thou say@@ est , ( but they are but vain words , ) I have counsel and strength for the war . now on whom d@@ ost thou trust , that thou reb@@ ell@@ est against me ?
now , behold , thou trust@@ est upon the staff of this bru@@ ised re@@ ed , even upon Egypt , on which if a man lean , it will go into his hand , and pi@@ erce it : so is Phar@@ o@@ ah king of Egypt unto all that trust on him .
then said Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of Hil@@ ki@@ ah , and She@@ b@@ na , and Jo@@ ah , unto R@@ ab @@@ -@@ @ sha@@ ke@@ h , Spe@@ ak , I pray thee , to thy servants in the Syrian language ; for we understand it : and talk not with us in the Jews ' language in the ears of the people that are on the wall .
then R@@ ab @@@ -@@ @ sha@@ ke@@ h stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and sp@@ ake , saying , He@@ ar the word of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ria :
neither let He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah make you trust in the LORD , saying , The LORD will surely deliver us , and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
hear@@ ken not to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah : for thus sa@@ ith the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , Make an agreement with me by a present , and come out to me , and then eat ye every man of his own vine , and every one of his fi@@ g tree , and drink ye every one the waters of his ci@@ stern :
where are the gods of Ham@@ ath , and of Ar@@ pad ? where are the gods of Sep@@ harv@@ aim , Hen@@ a , and Iv@@ ah ? have they delivered Sam@@ aria out of mine hand ?
who are they among all the gods of the countries , that have delivered their country out of mine hand , that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand ?
then came Eli@@ ak@@ im the son of Hil@@ ki@@ ah , which was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the scri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah the son of As@@ ap@@ h the recorder , to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah with their clothes rent , and told him the words of R@@ ab @@@ -@@ @ sha@@ ke@@ h .
and he sent Eli@@ ak@@ im , which was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the scri@@ be , and the elders of the priests , covered with s@@ ack@@ cloth , to Isaiah the prophet the son of A@@ mo@@ z .
and they said unto him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , This day is a day of trouble , and of rebu@@ ke , and bl@@ asph@@ emy : for the children are come to the birth , and there is not strength to bring forth .
and Isaiah said unto them , Th@@ us shall ye say to your master , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard , with which the servants of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria have bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed me .
behold , I will send a blast upon him , and he shall hear a rum@@ our , and shall return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land .
thus shall ye speak to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , saying , Let not thy God in whom thou trust@@ est deceive thee , saying , Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah received the letter of the hand of the messengers , and read it : and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah went up into the house of the LORD , and spread it before the LORD .
Lord , bow down th@@ ine ear , and hear : open , LORD , th@@ ine eyes , and see : and hear the words of Sen@@ n@@ ach@@ eri@@ b , which hath sent him to repro@@ ach the living God .
and have cast their gods into the fire : for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , O LORD our God , I bes@@ e@@ ech thee , save thou us out of his hand , that all the king@@ doms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD God , even thou only .
whom hast thou repro@@ ached and bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed ? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice , and lifted up th@@ ine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
I have di@@ gged and drunk strange waters , and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of be@@ sieg@@ ed places .
hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it , and of ancient times that I have formed it ? now have I brought it to pass , that thou shoul@@ dest be to lay waste f@@ enced cities into ru@@ inous he@@ aps .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dis@@ may@@ ed and conf@@ ounded ; they were as the grass of the field , and as the green her@@ b , as the grass on the hous@@ et@@ ops , and as corn b@@ lasted before it be grown up .
and this shall be a sign unto thee , Y@@ e shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves , and in the second year that which spring@@ eth of the same ; and in the third year sow ye , and reap , and plant vineyards , and eat the fruits thereof .
and the remn@@ ant that is escaped of the house of Jud@@ ah shall yet again take root downward , and bear fruit upward .
and it came to pass , as he was wor@@ shipping in the house of N@@ is@@ ro@@ ch his god , that A@@ dram@@ m@@ elec@@ h and Share@@ zer his sons smo@@ te him with the sword : and they escaped into the land of Armenia . and Es@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ H@@ add@@ on his son re@@ igned in his stead .
I bes@@ e@@ ech thee , O LORD , remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in thy sight . and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah we@@ pt sore .
and I will add unto thy days fifteen years ; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria ; and I will defend this city for mine own sake , and for my servant David 's sake .
and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah said unto Isaiah , What shall be the sign that the LORD will heal me , and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day ?
and Isaiah said , This sign shalt thou have of the LORD , that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken : shall the shadow go forth ten degrees , or go back ten degrees ?
and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah answered , It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees : n@@ ay , but let the shadow return backward ten degrees .
at that time Ber@@ od@@ ach @@@ -@@ @ bal@@ adan , the son of Bal@@ adan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present unto He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah : for he had heard that He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah had been sick .
then came Isaiah the prophet unto king He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , and said unto him , What said these men ? and from wh@@ ence came they unto thee ? and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah said , They are come from a far country , even from Babylon .
behold , the days come , that all that is in th@@ ine house , and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day , shall be carried into Babylon : nothing shall be left , sa@@ ith the LORD .
and of thy sons that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt be@@ get , shall they take away ; and they shall be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s in the palace of the king of Babylon .
then said He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah unto Isaiah , Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken . and he said , Is it not good , if peace and truth be in my days ?
Man@@ as@@ se@@ h was twelve years old when he began to reign , and re@@ igned fifty and five years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was H@@ eph@@ zi @@@ -@@ @ ba@@ h .
for he built up again the high places which He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah his father had destroyed ; and he re@@ ared up al@@ t@@ ars for Ba@@ al , and made a gro@@ ve , as did A@@ hab king of Israel ; and wor@@ shipped all the host of heaven , and served them .
and he made his son pass through the fire , and observed times , and used enchan@@ tments , and dealt with familiar spirits and w@@ izards : he wrought much w@@ ick@@ edness in the sight of the LORD , to provoke him to anger .
and I will for@@ sake the remn@@ ant of mine inheritance , and deliver them into the hand of their enemies ; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies ;
because they have done that which was evil in my sight , and have provoked me to anger , since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt , even unto this day .
moreover Man@@ as@@ se@@ h shed innocent blood very much , till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another ; beside his sin where@@ with he made Jud@@ ah to sin , in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD .
now the rest of the acts of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and all that he did , and his sin that he sin@@ ned , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ icles of the kings of Jud@@ ah ?
Am@@ on was twenty and two years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned two years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lem@@ eth , the daughter of Har@@ u@@ z of J@@ ot@@ ba@@ h .
and the people of the land sle@@ w all them that had con@@ spi@@ red against king Am@@ on ; and the people of the land made Jo@@ si@@ ah his son king in his stead .
Jo@@ si@@ ah was eight years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned thirty and one years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was J@@ edi@@ d@@ ah , the daughter of Ad@@ aiah of Bos@@ c@@ ath .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , and walked in all the way of David his father , and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left .
go up to Hil@@ ki@@ ah the high priest , that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD , which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people :
and Hil@@ ki@@ ah the high priest said unto Sha@@ ph@@ an the scri@@ be , I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD . and Hil@@ ki@@ ah gave the book to Sha@@ ph@@ an , and he read it .
and Sha@@ ph@@ an the scri@@ be sh@@ ew@@ ed the king , saying , Hil@@ ki@@ ah the priest hath delivered me a book . and Sha@@ ph@@ an read it before the king .
and the king commanded Hil@@ ki@@ ah the priest , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and Ach@@ b@@ or the son of Mic@@ ha@@ i@@ ah , and Sha@@ ph@@ an the scri@@ be , and As@@ a@@ hi@@ ah a servant of the king 's , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Be@@ hold , I will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the words of the book which the king of Jud@@ ah hath read :
because they have for@@ s@@ aken me , and have burned inc@@ ense unto other gods , that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands ; therefore my wrath shall be kind@@ led against this place , and shall not be qu@@ en@@ ched .
and he de@@ filed T@@ oph@@ eth , which is in the valley of the children of H@@ inno@@ m , that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Mol@@ ech .
and as Jo@@ si@@ ah turned himself , he sp@@ ied the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res that were there in the mount , and sent , and took the bones out of the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res , and burned them upon the altar , and polluted it , according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed , who proclaimed these words .
and he said , Let him alone ; let no man move his bones . so they let his bones alone , with the bones of the prophet that came out of Sam@@ aria .
and the king commanded all the people , saying , Keep the pas@@ sover unto the LORD your God , as it is written in the book of this covenant .
surely there was not Hol@@ den such a pas@@ sover from the days of the judges that judged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Jud@@ ah ;
but in the eighteenth year of king Jo@@ si@@ ah , where@@ in this pas@@ sover was Hol@@ den to the LORD in Jerusalem .
notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierc@@ eness of his great wrath , where@@ with his anger was kind@@ led against Jud@@ ah , because of all the provocations that Man@@ as@@ se@@ h had provoked him with@@ al .
and the LORD said , I will remove Jud@@ ah also out of my sight , as I have removed Israel , and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen , and the house of which I said , My name shall be there .
in his days Phar@@ aoh @@@ -@@ @ nec@@ ho@@ h king of Egypt went up against the king of As@@ sy@@ ria to the river E@@ uph@@ rates : and king Jo@@ si@@ ah went against him ; and he sle@@ w him at Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do , when he had seen him .
Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned three months in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Ham@@ ut@@ al , the daughter of Jer@@ emi@@ ah of Lib@@ n@@ ah .
and Phar@@ aoh @@@ -@@ @ nec@@ ho@@ h put him in bands at Ri@@ b@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath , that he might not reign in Jerusalem ; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver , and a talent of gold .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im was twenty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he re@@ igned eleven years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Ze@@ bud@@ ah , the daughter of Ped@@ aiah of Rum@@ ah .
and the LORD sent against him bands of the Chal@@ de@@ es , and bands of the Syrians , and bands of the Mo@@ ab@@ ites , and bands of the children of Am@@ mon , and sent them against Jud@@ ah to destroy it , according to the word of the LORD , which he sp@@ ake by his servants the prophets .
surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Jud@@ ah , to remove them out of his sight , for the sins of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , according to all that he did ;
and also for the innocent blood that he shed : for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood ; which the LORD would not pardon .
and the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land : for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river E@@ uph@@ rates all that per@@ tained to the king of Egypt .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in was eighteen years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned in Jerusalem three months . and his mother 's name was Ne@@ h@@ ush@@ ta , the daughter of El@@ na@@ than of Jerusalem .
and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in the king of Jud@@ ah went out to the king of Babylon , he , and his mother , and his servants , and his princes , and his officers : and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign .
and he carried away all Jerusalem , and all the princes , and all the mighty men of val@@ our , even ten thousand cap@@ tives , and all the craftsmen and s@@ mi@@ ths : none remained , save the poorest sort of the people of the land .
and he carried away Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in to Babylon , and the king 's mother , and the king 's wives , and his officers , and the mighty of the land , those carried he into cap@@ tivity from Jerusalem to Babylon .
and all the men of might , even seven thousand , and craftsmen and s@@ mi@@ ths a thousand , all that were strong and apt for war , even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon .
Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned eleven years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Ham@@ ut@@ al , the daughter of Jer@@ emi@@ ah of Lib@@ n@@ ah .
and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , according to all that Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im had done .
for through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Jud@@ ah , until he had cast them out from his presence , that Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah reb@@ elled against the king of Babylon .
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon came , he , and all his host , against Jerusalem , and pit@@ ched against it ; and they built for@@ ts against it round about .
and the army of the Chal@@ de@@ es pursued after the king , and over@@ took him in the plains of Jer@@ ich@@ o : and all his army were scattered from him .
and they sle@@ w the sons of Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah before his eyes , and put out the eyes of Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah , and bound him with fet@@ ters of brass , and carried him to Babylon .
and the pots , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the sn@@ u@@ ff@@ ers , and the spo@@ ons , and all the vessels of brass where@@ with they minist@@ ered , took they away .
the height of the one pillar was eighteen cub@@ its , and the chap@@ iter upon it was brass : and the height of the chap@@ iter three cub@@ its ; and the wre@@ a@@ then work , and p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates upon the chap@@ iter round about , all of brass : and like unto these had the second pillar with wre@@ a@@ then work .
and the king of Babylon smo@@ te them , and sle@@ w them at Ri@@ b@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath . so Jud@@ ah was carried away out of their land .
and as for the people that remained in the land of Jud@@ ah , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon had left , even over them he made G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , ruler .
but it came to pass in the seventh month , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ ani@@ ah , the son of Elis@@ h@@ ama , of the seed royal , came , and ten men with him , and smo@@ te G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , that he died , and the Jews and the Chal@@ de@@ es that were with him at M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h .
and all the people , both small and great , and the cap@@ tains of the armies , arose , and came to Egypt : for they were afraid of the Chal@@ de@@ es .

now these are the kings that re@@ igned in the land of E@@ dom before any king re@@ igned over the children of Israel ; Bel@@ a the son of Be@@ or : and the name of his city was D@@ inhab@@ ah .
and when Hus@@ ham was dead , had@@ ad the son of Bed@@ ad , which smo@@ te Mi@@ dian in the field of Mo@@ ab , re@@ igned in his stead : and the name of his city was Av@@ ith .
and when Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ Han@@ an was dead , had@@ ad re@@ igned in his stead : and the name of his city was P@@ ai ; and his wife 's name was Me@@ het@@ ab@@ el , the daughter of Mat@@ red , the daughter of Me@@ z@@ a@@ hab .

and they went to the entrance of G@@ ed@@ or , even unto the east side of the valley , to seek past@@ ure for their f@@ locks .
and they found fat past@@ ure and good , and the land was wide , and quiet , and peace@@ able ; for they of H@@ am had d@@ wel@@ t there of old .

now these are their dwelling places throughout their castles in their co@@ asts , of the sons of Aaron , of the families of the Ko@@ ha@@ th@@ ites : for theirs was the lot .
and to the sons of Ger@@ sh@@ om throughout their families out of the tribe of Is@@ sac@@ har , and out of the tribe of Ash@@ er , and out of the tribe of N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i , and out of the tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h in Bash@@ an , thirteen cities .

and the sons of U@@ lam were mighty men of val@@ our , arch@@ ers , and had many sons , and sons ' sons , an hundred and fifty . all these are of the sons of Benjamin .
so all Israel were reck@@ oned by gene@@ alo@@ gies ; and , behold , they were written in the book of the kings of Israel and Jud@@ ah , who were carried away to Babylon for their trans@@ g@@ ression .
and in Jerusalem d@@ wel@@ t of the children of Jud@@ ah , and of the children of Benjamin , and of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h ;

and their brethren , according to their generations , nine hundred and fifty and six . all these men were chief of the fathers in the house of their fathers .
and Ad@@ aiah the son of J@@ ero@@ ham , the son of Pash@@ ur , the son of Mal@@ chi@@ jah , and Ma@@ asi@@ ai the son of A@@ di@@ el , the son of J@@ ah@@ zer@@ ah , the son of M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lam , the son of M@@ esh@@ ill@@ em@@ ith , the son of Im@@ mer ;
and of the Lev@@ ites ; Sh@@ em@@ aiah the son of Has@@ shu@@ b , the son of Az@@ ri@@ k@@ am , the son of H@@ ash@@ ab@@ i@@ ah , of the sons of Mer@@ ari ;
and Bak@@ bak@@ kar , Her@@ esh , and Gal@@ al , and M@@ att@@ ani@@ ah the son of Mic@@ ah , the son of Z@@ ich@@ ri , the son of As@@ ap@@ h ;
and Ob@@ adi@@ ah the son of Sh@@ em@@ aiah , the son of Gal@@ al , the son of J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n , and Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah the son of As@@ a , the son of El@@ kan@@ ah , that d@@ wel@@ t in the villages of the Net@@ op@@ ha@@ th@@ ites .
and the porters were , Sh@@ all@@ um , and Ak@@ ku@@ b , and Tal@@ mon , and A@@ him@@ an , and their brethren : Sh@@ all@@ um was the chief ;
who hitherto waited in the king 's gate eastward : they were porters in the companies of the children of Lev@@ i .
and Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah the son of Mes@@ hel@@ emi@@ ah was porter of the door of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation .
all these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two hundred and twelve . these were reck@@ oned by their gen@@ eal@@ ogy in their villages , whom David and Samuel the se@@ er did ord@@ ain in their set office .
for these Lev@@ ites , the four chief porters , were in their set office , and were over the chambers and treas@@ uries of the house of God .
and Az@@ el had six sons , whose names are these , Az@@ ri@@ k@@ am , Bo@@ cher@@ u , and I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el , and S@@ hear@@ i@@ ah , and Ob@@ adi@@ ah , and Han@@ an : these were the sons of Az@@ el .
now the Phil@@ ist@@ ines fought against Israel ; and the men of Israel fled from before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and fell down sl@@ ain in mount Gil@@ bo@@ a .
and when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled , and that Saul and his sons were dead , then they for@@ s@@ ook their cities , and fled : and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came and d@@ wel@@ t in them .
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , when the Phil@@ ist@@ ines came to strip the sl@@ ain , that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gil@@ bo@@ a .
and when they had stripped him , they took his head , and his arm@@ our , and sent into the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines round about , to carry ti@@ dings unto their idols , and to the people .
and they put his arm@@ our in the house of their gods , and fast@@ ened his head in the temple of D@@ agon .
they arose , all the val@@ i@@ ant men , and took away the body of Saul , and the bodies of his sons , and brought them to Jab@@ esh , and buried their bones under the oak in Jab@@ esh , and fast@@ ed seven days .
and moreover in time past , even when Saul was king , thou w@@ ast he that le@@ dd@@ est out and br@@ ough@@ test in Israel : and the LORD thy God said unto thee , Th@@ ou shalt feed my people Israel , and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel , and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel .
therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to He@@ br@@ on ; and David made a covenant with them in He@@ br@@ on before the LORD ; and they ano@@ inted David king over Israel , according to the word of the LORD by Samuel .
and the inhabitants of Je@@ bus said to David , Th@@ ou shalt not come hi@@ ther . nevertheless David took the castle of Z@@ ion , which is the city of David .
these also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had , who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom , and with all Israel , to make him king , according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel .
and this is the number of the mighty men whom David had ; Jas@@ ho@@ beam , and H@@ ach@@ mon@@ ite , the chief of the cap@@ tains : he lifted up his spe@@ ar against three hundred sl@@ ain by him at one time .
he was with David at P@@ as @@@ -@@ @ dam@@ mi@@ m , and there the Phil@@ ist@@ ines were gathered together to battle , where was a parcel of ground full of barley ; and the people fled from before the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
now three of the thirty cap@@ tains went down to the rock to David , into the cave of Ad@@ ul@@ lam ; and the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines enc@@ amped in the valley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
and David long@@ ed , and said , Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem , that is at the gate !
and the three brake through the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but David would not drink of it , but poured it out to the LORD ,
and Ab@@ is@@ hai the brother of Jo@@ ab , he was chief of the three : for lifting up his spe@@ ar against three hundred , he sle@@ w them , and had a name among the three .
Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , the son of a val@@ i@@ ant man of Kab@@ ze@@ el , who had done many acts ; he sle@@ w two lion@@ like men of Mo@@ ab : also he went down and sle@@ w a lion in a pit in a snow@@ y day .
also the val@@ i@@ ant men of the armies were , As@@ ah@@ el the brother of Jo@@ ab , El@@ han@@ an the son of Do@@ do of Bethlehem ,
now these are they that came to David to Z@@ ik@@ lag , while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of K@@ ish : and they were among the mighty men , help@@ ers of the war .
the chief was A@@ hi@@ ez@@ er , then Jo@@ ash , the sons of Sh@@ em@@ a@@ ah the Gi@@ be@@ ath@@ ite ; and J@@ ez@@ iel , and Pel@@ et , the sons of Az@@ m@@ av@@ eth ; and Ber@@ acha@@ h , and Je@@ hu the An@@ to@@ th@@ ite ,
and Is@@ m@@ aiah the Gi@@ be@@ on@@ ite , a mighty man among the thirty , and over the thirty ; and Jer@@ emi@@ ah , and Ja@@ haz@@ iel , and Johan@@ an , and Jos@@ abad the G@@ ed@@ er@@ ath@@ ite ,
as he went to Z@@ ik@@ lag , there fell to him of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , Ad@@ n@@ ah , and Jo@@ z@@ abad , and J@@ edi@@ ael , and Michael , and Jo@@ z@@ abad , and Eli@@ hu , and Z@@ il@@ th@@ ai , cap@@ tains of the thousands that were of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
and they helped David against the band of the ro@@ vers : for they were all mighty men of val@@ our , and were cap@@ tains in the host .
for at that time day by day there came to David to help him , until it was a great host , like the host of God .
the children of Jud@@ ah that bare shield and spe@@ ar were six thousand and eight hundred , ready armed to the war .
and Z@@ ad@@ ok , a young man mighty of val@@ our , and of his father 's house twenty and two cap@@ tains .
and of the half tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h eighteen thousand , which were expressed by name , to come and make David king .
and of the children of Is@@ sac@@ har , which were men that had understanding of the times , to know what Israel ought to do ; the heads of them were two hundred ; and all their brethren were at their commandment .
all these men of war , that could keep rank , came with a perfect heart to He@@ br@@ on , to make David king over all Israel : and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king .
and let us bring again the ark of our God to us : for we inqui@@ red not at it in the days of Saul .
so David gathered all Israel together , from Shi@@ h@@ or of Egypt even unto the entering of Ham@@ ath , to bring the ark of God from Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im .
and David went up , and all Israel , to Ba@@ al@@ ah , that is , to Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im , which belonged to Jud@@ ah , to bring up th@@ ence the ark of God the LORD , that dwell@@ eth between the cher@@ ub@@ ims , whose name is called on it .
and they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Ab@@ in@@ ad@@ ab : and Uz@@ za and A@@ hio dra@@ ve the cart .
and David and all Israel played before God with all their might , and with singing , and with har@@ ps , and with p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies , and with tim@@ b@@ rels , and with cy@@ mb@@ als , and with trum@@ pets .
and the ark of God remained with the family of O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom in his house three months . and the LORD blessed the house of O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom , and all that he had .
now these are the names of his children which he had in Jerusalem ; Sham@@ mu@@ a , and Sho@@ ba@@ b , Na@@ than , and Solomon ,
and David inqui@@ red of God , saying , Sh@@ all I go up against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines ? and wil@@ t thou deliver them into mine hand ? and the LORD said unto him , Go up ; for I will deliver them into th@@ ine hand .
so they came up to Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ per@@ az@@ im ; and David smo@@ te them there . then David said , God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters : therefore they called the name of that place Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ per@@ az@@ im .
and the fame of David went out into all lands ; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations .
and David made him houses in the city of David , and prepared a place for the ark of God , and pit@@ ched for it a tent .
and David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem , to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place , which he had prepared for it .
and the children of the Lev@@ ites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the st@@ aves there@@ on , as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD .
and David sp@@ ake to the chief of the Lev@@ ites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of mus@@ ick , p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies and har@@ ps and cy@@ mb@@ als , sounding , by lifting up the voice with joy .
and with them their brethren of the second degree , Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , Ben , and Ja@@ az@@ iel , and Sh@@ em@@ ir@@ am@@ o@@ th , and Je@@ hi@@ el , and Un@@ ni , Eli@@ ab , and Ben@@ aiah , and Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah , and Mat@@ ti@@ thi@@ ah , and Eli@@ ph@@ el@@ eh , and Mik@@ nei@@ ah , and O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom , and J@@ ei@@ el , the porters .
and Mat@@ ti@@ thi@@ ah , and Eli@@ ph@@ el@@ eh , and Mik@@ nei@@ ah , and O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom , and J@@ ei@@ el , and Az@@ az@@ i@@ ah , with har@@ ps on the Sh@@ emin@@ ith to exc@@ el .
and Chen@@ ani@@ ah , chief of the Lev@@ ites , was for song : he instructed about the song , because he was sk@@ il@@ ful .
and She@@ ban@@ i@@ ah , and Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , and N@@ eth@@ an@@ e@@ el , and A@@ mas@@ ai , and Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , and Ben@@ aiah , and Eli@@ ez@@ er , the priests , did blow with the trum@@ pets before the ark of God : and O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom and Je@@ hi@@ ah were door@@ keepers for the ark .
and it came to pass , when God helped the Lev@@ ites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD , that they offered seven bul@@ locks and seven r@@ ams .
and David was clo@@ thed with a robe of fine linen , and all the Lev@@ ites that bare the ark , and the singers , and Chen@@ ani@@ ah the master of the song with the singers : David also had upon him an ep@@ ho@@ d of linen .
and it came to pass , as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David , that Mic@@ h@@ al the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing : and she desp@@ ised him in her heart .
so they brought the ark of God , and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pit@@ ched for it : and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God .
As@@ ap@@ h the chief , and next to him Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , J@@ ei@@ el , and Sh@@ em@@ ir@@ am@@ o@@ th , and Je@@ hi@@ el , and Mat@@ ti@@ thi@@ ah , and Eli@@ ab , and Ben@@ aiah , and O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom : and J@@ ei@@ el with p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies and with har@@ ps ; but As@@ ap@@ h made a sound with cy@@ mb@@ als ;
give thanks unto the LORD , call upon his name , make known his deeds among the people .
give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name : bring an offering , and come before him : worship the LORD in the beauty of hol@@ iness .
let the heavens be glad , and let the earth rejoice : and let men say among the nations , The LORD re@@ ig@@ neth .
then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD , because he com@@ eth to judge the earth .
and say ye , Save us , O God of our salvation , and gather us together , and deliver us from the he@@ a@@ then , that we may give thanks to thy holy name , and glory in thy praise .
so he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD As@@ ap@@ h and his brethren , to minister before the ark continually , as every day 's work required :
to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening , and to do according to all that is written in the law of the LORD , which he commanded Israel ;
and with them h@@ eman and J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n , and the rest that were chosen , who were expressed by name , to give thanks to the LORD , because his mercy endu@@ re@@ th for ever ;
and with them h@@ eman and J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n with trum@@ pets and cy@@ mb@@ als for those that should make a sound , and with musical instruments of God . and the sons of J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n were porters .
W@@ her@@ eso@@ ever I have walked with all Israel , sp@@ ake I a word to any of the judges of Israel , whom I commanded to feed my people , saying , Why have ye not built me an house of c@@ ed@@ ars ?
and I have been with thee whi@@ ther@@ soever thou hast walked , and have cut off all th@@ ine enemies from before thee , and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth .
also I will ord@@ ain a place for my people Israel , and will plant them , and they shall dwell in their place , and shall be moved no more ; neither shall the children of w@@ ick@@ edness waste them any more , as at the beginning ,
and since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel . moreover I will sub@@ due all th@@ ine enemies . furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house .
O LORD , for thy servant 's sake , and according to th@@ ine own heart , hast thou done all this greatness , in making known all these great things .
O LORD , there is none like thee , neither is there any God beside thee , according to all that we have heard with our ears .
let it even be established , that thy name may be magni@@ fied for ever , saying , The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel , even a God to Israel : and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee .
for thou , O my God , hast told thy servant that thou wil@@ t build him an house : therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee .
now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant , that it may be before thee for ever : for thou bl@@ ess@@ est , O LORD , and it shall be blessed for ever .
and David took from him a thousand ch@@ ari@@ ots , and seven thousand hor@@ sem@@ en , and twenty thousand foot@@ men : David also h@@ ough@@ ed all the ch@@ ari@@ ot horses , but reserved of them an hundred ch@@ ari@@ ots .
likewise from Ti@@ b@@ hath , and from Ch@@ un , cities of Had@@ are@@ zer , brought David very much brass , where@@ with Solomon made the br@@ as@@ en sea , and the pillars , and the vessels of brass .
them also king David dedicated unto the LORD , with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations ; from E@@ dom , and from Mo@@ ab , and from the children of Am@@ mon , and from the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and from A@@ mal@@ ek .
and Z@@ ad@@ ok the son of Ah@@ it@@ u@@ b , and Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h the son of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar , were the priests ; and Sha@@ v@@ sha was scri@@ be ;
and when the children of Am@@ mon saw that the Syrians were fled , they likewise fled before Ab@@ is@@ hai his brother , and entered into the city . then Jo@@ ab came to Jerusalem .
and when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel , they sent messengers , and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river : and Shop@@ h@@ ach the captain of the host of Had@@ are@@ zer went before them .
and he brought out the people that were in it , and cut them with s@@ aws , and with har@@ rows of iron , and with axes . even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Am@@ mon . and David and all the people returned to Jerusalem .
these were born unto the giant in G@@ ath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
and David said to Jo@@ ab and to the rulers of the people , Go , number Israel from Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba even to Dan ; and bring the number of them to me , that I may know it .
and Jo@@ ab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David . and all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword : and Jud@@ ah was four hundred thre@@ es@@ core and ten thousand men that drew sword .
and David said unto G@@ ad , I am in a great str@@ ait : let me fall now into the hand of the LORD ; for very great are his mer@@ cies : but let me not fall into the hand of man .
and David lifted up his eyes , and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven , having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem . then David and the elders of Israel , who were clo@@ thed in s@@ ack@@ cloth , fell upon their faces .
and as David came to Or@@ nan , Or@@ nan looked and saw David , and went out of the thresh@@ ing@@ floor , and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground .
then David said to Or@@ nan , Grant me the place of this thresh@@ ing@@ floor , that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD : thou shalt grant it me for the full price : that the plague may be stayed from the people .
and Or@@ nan said unto David , Take it to thee , and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes : lo , I give thee the ox@@ en also for burnt offerings , and the thresh@@ ing instruments for wood , and the wheat for the meat offering ; I give it all .
and king David said to Or@@ nan , N@@ ay ; but I will verily buy it for the full price : for I will not take that which is th@@ ine for the LORD , nor offer burnt offerings without cost .
and David built there an altar unto the LORD , and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings , and called upon the LORD ; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering .
for the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the LORD , which Moses made in the wilderness , and the altar of the burnt offering , were at that season in the high place at Gi@@ be@@ on .
but David could not go before it to inqu@@ ire of God : for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD .
and David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel ; and he set mas@@ ons to he@@ w wrought stones to build the house of God .
and David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates , and for the join@@ ings ; and brass in abundance without weight ;
then he called for Solomon his son , and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of Israel .
and David said to Solomon , My son , as for me , it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God :
behold , a son shall be born to thee , who shall be a man of rest ; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about : for his name shall be Solomon , and I will give peace and qui@@ et@@ ness unto Israel in his days .
he shall build an house for my name ; and he shall be my son , and I will be his father ; and I will establish throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever .
only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding , and give thee charge concerning Israel , that thou may@@ est keep the law of the LORD thy God .
then shalt thou prosper , if thou tak@@ est heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel : be strong , and of good courage ; dre@@ ad not , nor be dis@@ may@@ ed .
is not the LORD your God with you ? and hath he not given you rest on every side ? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand ; and the land is subdued before the LORD , and before his people .
so when David was old and full of days , he made Solomon his son king over Israel .
now the Lev@@ ites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward : and their number by their polls , man by man , was thirty and eight thousand .
moreover four thousand were porters ; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made , said David , to praise there@@ with .
and David divided them into courses among the sons of Lev@@ i , namely , Ger@@ sh@@ on , Ko@@ hath , and Mer@@ ari .
the sons of La@@ adan ; the chief was Je@@ hi@@ el , and Z@@ eth@@ am , and Jo@@ el , three .
and the sons of Shim@@ ei were , J@@ ah@@ ath , Z@@ ina , and Je@@ ush , and B@@ eri@@ ah . these four were the sons of Shim@@ ei .
and J@@ ah@@ ath was the chief , and Z@@ iz@@ ah the second : but Je@@ ush and B@@ eri@@ ah had not many sons ; therefore they were in one reckoning , according to their father 's house .
the sons of Am@@ ram ; Aaron and Moses : and Aaron was separated , that he should sancti@@ fy the most holy things , he and his sons for ever , to burn inc@@ ense before the LORD , to minister unto him , and to bless in his name for ever .
the sons of Mer@@ ari ; Mah@@ li , and Mus@@ hi . the sons of Mah@@ li ; Ele@@ az@@ ar , and K@@ ish .
and to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sab@@ baths , in the new mo@@ ons , and on the set fe@@ asts , by number , according to the order commanded unto them , continually before the LORD :
and David distributed them , both Z@@ ad@@ ok of the sons of Ele@@ az@@ ar , and A@@ him@@ elec@@ h of the sons of I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , according to their offices in their service .
these were the or@@ der@@ ings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD , according to their manner , under Aaron their father , as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him .
and the rest of the sons of Lev@@ i were these : of the sons of Am@@ ram ; Sh@@ ub@@ ael : of the sons of Sh@@ ub@@ ael ; Je@@ h@@ de@@ i@@ ah .
and the sons of He@@ br@@ on ; J@@ eri@@ ah the first , A@@ mari@@ ah the second , Ja@@ haz@@ iel the third , J@@ ek@@ ame@@ am the fourth .
of J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n : the sons of J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n ; G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , and Z@@ eri , and Jes@@ ha@@ i@@ ah , H@@ ash@@ ab@@ i@@ ah , and Mat@@ ti@@ thi@@ ah , six , under the hands of their father J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n , who prophe@@ si@@ ed with a har@@ p , to give thanks and to praise the LORD .
all these were the sons of h@@ eman the king 's se@@ er in the words of God , to lift up the horn . and God gave to h@@ eman fourteen sons and three daughters .
so the number of them , with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the LORD , even all that were cunning , was two hundred four@@ score and eight .
concerning the divisions of the porters : of the Kor@@ h@@ ites was Mes@@ hel@@ emi@@ ah the son of K@@ ore , of the sons of As@@ ap@@ h .
also unto Sh@@ em@@ aiah his son were sons born , that ruled throughout the house of their father : for they were mighty men of val@@ our .
the sons of Sh@@ em@@ aiah ; O@@ th@@ ni , and Rep@@ hael , and O@@ bed , El@@ z@@ abad , whose brethren were strong men , Eli@@ hu , and Sem@@ achi@@ ah .
also Hos@@ ah , of the children of Mer@@ ari , had sons ; Sim@@ ri the chief , ( for though he was not the fir@@ st@@ born , yet his father made him the chief ; )
among these were the divisions of the porters , even among the chief men , having wards one against another , to minister in the house of the LORD .
to Sh@@ up@@ pi@@ m and Hos@@ ah the lot came forth w@@ est@@ ward , with the gate Sh@@ all@@ ech@@ eth , by the ca@@ use@@ way of the going up , ward against ward .
and of the Lev@@ ites , A@@ hij@@ ah was over the treasures of the house of God , and over the treasures of the dedicated things .
the sons of Je@@ hi@@ eli ; Z@@ eth@@ am , and Jo@@ el his brother , which were over the treasures of the house of the LORD .
out of the spo@@ ils won in battles did they dedic@@ ate to maintain the house of the LORD .
and all that Samuel the se@@ er , and Saul the son of K@@ ish , and Ab@@ ner the son of N@@ er , and Jo@@ ab the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah , had dedicated ; and wh@@ oso@@ ever had dedicated any thing , it was under the hand of Shel@@ om@@ ith , and of his brethren .
and of the He@@ bron@@ ites , H@@ ash@@ ab@@ i@@ ah and his brethren , men of val@@ our , a thousand and seven hundred , were officers among them of Israel on this side Jordan w@@ est@@ ward in all the business of the LORD , and in the service of the king .
of the children of Per@@ ez was the chief of all the cap@@ tains of the host for the first month .
and over the course of the second month was D@@ od@@ ai an A@@ ho@@ h@@ ite , and of his course was Mik@@ lo@@ th also the ruler : in his course likewise were twenty and four thousand .
the third captain of the host for the third month was Ben@@ aiah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada , a chief priest : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
the seventh captain for the seventh month was Hel@@ ez the Pel@@ on@@ ite , of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
the eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Ben@@ aiah the Pir@@ ath@@ on@@ ite , of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , Hos@@ he@@ a the son of Az@@ az@@ i@@ ah : of the half tribe of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , Jo@@ el the son of Ped@@ aiah :
of Dan , Az@@ are@@ el the son of J@@ ero@@ ham . these were the princes of the tribes of Israel .
Jo@@ ab the son of Zer@@ u@@ i@@ ah began to number , but he finished not , because there fell wrath for it against Israel ; neither was the number put in the account of the chron@@ icles of king David .
and over the king 's treasures was Az@@ m@@ av@@ eth the son of A@@ di@@ el : and over the store@@ houses in the fields , in the cities , and in the villages , and in the castles , was Je@@ hon@@ athan the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah :
and over the herds that fed in Sharon was Sh@@ it@@ ra@@ i the Shar@@ on@@ ite : and over the herds that were in the valleys was Sha@@ ph@@ at the son of Ad@@ la@@ i :
over the cam@@ els also was O@@ bi@@ l the I@@ sh@@ ma@@ elite : and over the asses was Je@@ h@@ de@@ i@@ ah the Mer@@ on@@ oth@@ ite :
also Jonathan David 's uncle was a coun@@ seller , a wise man , and a scri@@ be : and Je@@ hi@@ el the son of H@@ ach@@ mon@@ i was with the king 's sons :
and after A@@ hi@@ th@@ oph@@ el was Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the son of Ben@@ aiah , and A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar : and the general of the king 's army was Jo@@ ab .
and of all my sons , ( for the LORD hath given me many sons , ) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel .
and he said unto me , Solomon thy son , he shall build my house and my courts : for I have chosen him to be my son , and I will be his father .
take heed now ; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary : be strong , and do it .
then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the por@@ ch , and of the houses thereof , and of the treas@@ uries thereof , and of the upper chambers thereof , and of the inner parl@@ ours thereof , and of the place of the mercy seat ,
he gave of gold by weight for things of gold , for all instruments of all manner of service ; silver also for all instruments of silver by weight , for all instruments of every kind of service :
even the weight for the cand@@ les@@ tic@@ ks of gold , and for their lamps of gold , by weight for every cand@@ les@@ tick , and for the lamps thereof : and for the cand@@ les@@ tic@@ ks of silver by weight , both for the cand@@ les@@ tick , and also for the lamps thereof , according to the use of every cand@@ les@@ tick .
and by weight he gave gold for the tables of sh@@ ew@@ bread , for every table ; and likewise silver for the tables of silver :
also pure gold for the fl@@ esh@@ hoo@@ ks , and the bow@@ ls , and the cups : and for the golden bas@@ ons he gave gold by weight for every bas@@ on ; and likewise silver by weight for every bas@@ on of silver :
all this , said David , the LORD made me understand in writing by his hand upon me , even all the works of this pattern .
furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation , Solomon my son , whom alone God hath chosen , is yet young and tender , and the work is great : for the palace is not for man , but for the LORD God .
even three thousand talents of gold , of the gold of O@@ ph@@ ir , and seven thousand talents of refined silver , to over@@ lay the walls of the houses with@@ al :
and gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand dr@@ ams , and of silver ten thousand talents , and of brass eighteen thousand talents , and one hundred thousand talents of iron .
and they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the LORD , by the hand of Je@@ hi@@ el the Ger@@ sh@@ on@@ ite .
then the people rejo@@ iced , for that they offered willingly , because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD : and David the king also rejo@@ iced with great joy .
th@@ ine , O LORD , is the greatness , and the power , and the glory , and the victory , and the maj@@ esty : for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is th@@ ine ; th@@ ine is the kingdom , O LORD , and thou art exalted as head above all .
both riches and honour come of thee , and thou re@@ ign@@ est over all ; and in th@@ ine hand is power and might ; and in th@@ ine hand it is to make great , and to give strength unto all .
but who am I , and what is my people , that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort ? for all things come of thee , and of th@@ ine own have we given thee .
O LORD God of Abraham , Isaac , and of Israel , our fathers , keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people , and prepare their heart unto thee :
and give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart , to keep thy commandments , thy testim@@ onies , and thy statutes , and to do all these things , and to build the palace , for the which I have made provision .
and David said to all the congregation , Now bless the LORD your God . and all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers , and bowed down their heads , and wor@@ shipped the LORD , and the king .
and they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD , and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD , on the mor@@ row after that day , even a thousand bul@@ locks , a thousand r@@ ams , and a thousand lam@@ bs , with their drink offerings , and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel :
and did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gl@@ ad@@ ness . and they made Solomon the son of David king the second time , and ano@@ inted him unto the LORD to be the chief governor , and Z@@ ad@@ ok to be priest .
and the LORD magni@@ fied Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel , and bestowed upon him such royal maj@@ esty as had not been on any king before him in Israel .
then Solomon sp@@ ake unto all Israel , to the cap@@ tains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every governor in all Israel , the chief of the fathers .
so Solomon , and all the congregation with him , went to the high place that was at Gi@@ be@@ on ; for there was the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation of God , which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness .
but the ark of God had David brought up from Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im to the place which David had prepared for it : for he had pit@@ ched a tent for it at Jerusalem .
moreover the br@@ as@@ en altar , that B@@ ez@@ al@@ e@@ el the son of U@@ ri , the son of H@@ ur , had made , he put before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the LORD : and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it .
now , O LORD God , let thy promise unto David my father be established : for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude .
wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee ; and I will give thee riches , and wealth , and honour , such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee , neither shall there any after thee have the like .
then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gi@@ be@@ on to Jerusalem , from before the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the congregation , and re@@ igned over Israel .
and Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt , and linen yar@@ n : the king 's merchants received the linen yar@@ n at a price .
send me also c@@ edar trees , f@@ ir trees , and al@@ gum trees , out of Lebanon : for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon ; and , behold , my servants shall be with thy servants ,
Hur@@ am said moreover , Bless@@ ed be the LORD God of Israel , that made heaven and earth , who hath given to David the king a wise son , endu@@ ed with prudence and understanding , that might build an house for the LORD , and an house for his kingdom .
now therefore the wheat , and the barley , the oil , and the wine , which my lord hath spoken of , let him send unto his servants :
and we will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as thou shalt need : and we will bring it to thee in flo@@ ats by sea to J@@ op@@ pa ; and thou shall carry it up to Jerusalem .
and Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel , after the numbering where@@ with David his father had numbered them ; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred .
and he set thre@@ es@@ core and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens , and four@@ score thousand to be he@@ w@@ ers in the mountain , and three thousand and six hundred over@@ se@@ ers to set the people a work .
then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount M@@ ori@@ ah , where the LORD appeared unto David his father , in the place that David had prepared in the thresh@@ ing@@ floor of Or@@ nan the Je@@ bus@@ ite .
and he began to build in the second day of the second month , in the fourth year of his reign .
now these are the things where@@ in Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God . the length by cub@@ its after the first measure was thre@@ es@@ core cub@@ its , and the breadth twenty cub@@ its .
and he made the most holy house , the length where@@ of was according to the breadth of the house , twenty cub@@ its , and the breadth thereof twenty cub@@ its : and he over@@ laid it with fine gold , amounting to six hundred talents .
and in the most holy house he made two cher@@ ub@@ ims of image work , and over@@ laid them with gold .
also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cub@@ its high , and the chap@@ iter that was on the top of each of them was five cub@@ its .
and he made chains , as in the or@@ acle , and put them on the heads of the pillars ; and made an hundred p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates , and put them on the chains .
moreover he made an altar of brass , twenty cub@@ its the length thereof , and twenty cub@@ its the breadth thereof , and ten cub@@ its the height thereof .
and under it was the simil@@ itude of ox@@ en , which did compass it round about : ten in a cub@@ it , comp@@ assing the sea round about . two rows of ox@@ en were cast , when it was cast .
and the thickness of it was an hand@@ breadth , and the bri@@ m of it like the work of the bri@@ m of a cup , with flowers of l@@ ilies ; and it received and held three thousand baths .
and he made ten cand@@ les@@ tic@@ ks of gold according to their form , and set them in the temple , five on the right hand , and five on the left .
he made also ten tables , and placed them in the temple , five on the right side , and five on the left . and he made an hundred bas@@ ons of gold .
and Hur@@ am made the pots , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the bas@@ ons . and Hur@@ am finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God ;
and four hundred p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates on the two wre@@ aths ; two rows of p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates on each w@@ reat@@ h , to cover the two pom@@ m@@ els of the chap@@ it@@ ers which were upon the pillars .
the pots also , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the fl@@ esh@@ hoo@@ ks , and all their instruments , did Hur@@ am his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass .
and Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God , the golden altar also , and the tables where@@ on the sh@@ ew@@ bread was set ;
and the flowers , and the lamps , and the t@@ ongs , made he of gold , and that perfect gold ;
and the sn@@ u@@ ff@@ ers , and the bas@@ ons , and the spo@@ ons , and the cens@@ ers , of pure gold : and the entry of the house , the inner doors thereof for the most holy place , and the doors of the house of the temple , were of gold .
there was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at H@@ ore@@ b , when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of Egypt .
but I have built an house of hab@@ itation for thee , and a place for thy dwelling for ever .
now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel .
but the LORD said to David my father , for@@ as@@ much as it was in th@@ ine heart to build an house for my name , thou did@@ st well in that it was in th@@ ine heart :
and said , O LORD God of Israel , there is no God like thee in the heaven , nor in the earth ; which keep@@ est covenant , and sh@@ ew@@ est mercy unto thy servants , that walk before thee with all their hearts :
thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him ; and sp@@ ak@@ est with thy mouth , and hast fulfilled it with th@@ ine hand , as it is this day .
but will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth ? behold , heaven and the heaven of heavens C@@ AN@@ NOT contain thee ; how much less this house which I have built !
have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant , and to his suppl@@ ication , O LORD my God , to hear@@ ken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant pra@@ y@@ eth before thee :
that th@@ ine eyes may be open upon this house day and night , upon the place where@@ of thou hast said that thou w@@ oul@@ dest put thy name there ; to hear@@ ken unto the prayer which thy servant pra@@ y@@ eth toward this place .
hear@@ ken therefore unto the suppl@@ ications of thy servant , and of thy people Israel , which they shall make toward this place : hear thou from thy dwelling place , even from heaven ; and when thou he@@ arest , forgive .
then hear thou from heaven , and do , and judge thy servants , by requ@@ iting the wicked , by re@@ comp@@ en@@ sing his way upon his own head ; and by justi@@ fying the righteous , by giving him according to his righteousness .
then hear thou from the heavens , and forgive the sin of thy people Israel , and bring them again unto the land which thou g@@ av@@ est to them and to their fathers .
then hear thou from heaven , and forgive the sin of thy servants , and of thy people Israel , when thou hast taught them the good way , where@@ in they should walk ; and send rain upon thy land , which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance .
then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place , and forgive , and render unto every man according unto all his ways , whose heart thou know@@ est ; ( for thou only know@@ est the hearts of the children of men : )
moreover concerning the stranger , which is not of thy people Israel , but is come from a far country for thy great name 's sake , and thy mighty hand , and thy stretched out arm ; if they come and pray in this house ;
yet if they be@@ think themselves in the land whi@@ ther they are carried captive , and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their cap@@ tivity , saying , We have sin@@ ned , we have done am@@ iss , and have dealt w@@ ick@@ edly ;
now therefore arise , O LORD God , into thy resting place , thou , and the ark of thy strength : let thy priests , O LORD God , be clo@@ thed with salvation , and let thy saints rejoice in goodness .
and when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down , and the glory of the LORD upon the house , they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pav@@ ement , and wor@@ shipped , and praised the LORD , saying , For he is good ; for his mercy endu@@ re@@ th for ever .
and king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand ox@@ en , and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep : so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God .
moreover Solomon hal@@ lowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD : for there he offered burnt offerings , and the fat of the peace offerings , because the br@@ as@@ en altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings , and the meat offerings , and the fat .
also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days , and all Israel with him , a very great congregation , from the entering in of Ham@@ ath unto the river of Egypt .
and on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents , glad and mer@@ ry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had sh@@ ew@@ ed unto David , and to Solomon , and to Israel his people .
thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD , and the king 's house : and all that came into Solomon 's heart to make in the house of the LORD , and in his own house , he prosper@@ ously effected .
and the LORD appeared to Solomon by night , and said unto him , I have heard thy prayer , and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice .
if I shut up heaven that there be no rain , or if I command the lo@@ cu@@ sts to dev@@ our the land , or if I send pesti@@ l@@ ence among my people ;
if my people , which are called by my name , shall humble themselves , and pray , and seek my face , and turn from their wicked ways ; then will I hear from heaven , and will forgive their sin , and will heal their land .
now mine eyes shall be open , and mine ears att@@ ent unto the prayer that is made in this place .
and as for thee , if thou wil@@ t walk before me , as David thy father walked , and do according to all that I have commanded thee , and shalt observe my statues and my judgments ;
then will I st@@ ablis@@ h the throne of thy kingdom , according as I have coven@@ anted with David thy father , saying , There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel .
but if ye turn away , and for@@ sake my statutes and my commandments , which I have set before you , and shall go and serve other gods , and worship them ;
then will I pl@@ uck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have sancti@@ fied for my name , will I cast out of my sight , and will make it to be a prover@@ b and a by@@ word among all nations .
and this house , which is high , shall be an aston@@ ishment to every one that pass@@ eth by it ; so that he shall say , Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land , and unto this house ?
that the cities which Hur@@ am had restored to Solomon , Solomon built them , and caused the children of Israel to dwell there .
also he built B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on the upper , and B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on the ne@@ ther , f@@ enced cities , with walls , gates , and bars ;
as for all the people that were left of the Hit@@ ti@@ tes , and the A@@ mor@@ ites , and the Per@@ iz@@ z@@ ites , and the Hi@@ v@@ ites , and the Je@@ bus@@ ites , which were not of Israel ,
but of their children , who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel consumed not , them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day .
but of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work ; but they were men of war , and chief of his cap@@ tains , and cap@@ tains of his ch@@ ari@@ ots and hor@@ sem@@ en .
even after a certain rate every day , offering according to the commandment of Moses , on the sab@@ baths , and on the new mo@@ ons , and on the solemn fe@@ asts , three times in the year , even in the feast of un@@ leav@@ ened bread , and in the feast of weeks , and in the feast of tab@@ ern@@ acles .
and they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Lev@@ ites concerning any matter , or concerning the treasures .
and Hur@@ am sent him by the hands of his servants ships , and servants that had knowledge of the sea ; and they went with the servants of Solomon to O@@ ph@@ ir , and took th@@ ence four hundred and fifty talents of gold , and brought them to king Solomon .
and she said to the king , It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of th@@ ine acts , and of thy wisdom :
and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold , and of spices great abundance , and precious stones : neither was there any such sp@@ ice as the queen of She@@ ba gave king Solomon .
and the king made of the al@@ gum trees terraces to the house of the LORD , and to the king 's palace , and har@@ ps and p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies for singers : and there were none such seen before in the land of Jud@@ ah .
and king Solomon gave to the queen of She@@ ba all her desire , whatsoever she asked , beside that which she had brought unto the king . so she turned , and went away to her own land , she and her servants .
and three hundred shi@@ elds made he of beaten gold : three hundred she@@ k@@ els of gold went to one shield . and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon .
and there were six steps to the throne , with a foot@@ stool of gold , which were fast@@ ened to the throne , and stays on each side of the sitting place , and two lions standing by the stays :
and all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold : none were of silver ; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
and all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon , to hear his wisdom , that God had put in his heart .
and they brought every man his present , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and ra@@ iment , harness , and spices , horses , and mul@@ es , a rate year by year .
and it came to pass , when J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , who was in Egypt , whi@@ ther he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king , heard it , that J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am returned out of Egypt .
and he said unto them , What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people , which have spoken to me , saying , E@@ ase somewhat the y@@ oke that thy father did put upon us ?
for whereas my father put a heavy y@@ oke upon you , I will put more to your y@@ oke : my father ch@@ asti@@ sed you with whi@@ ps , but I will ch@@ as@@ tise you with scor@@ pi@@ ons .
so the king hear@@ k@@ ened not unto the people : for the cause was of God , that the LORD might perform his word , which he sp@@ ake by the hand of A@@ hij@@ ah the Sh@@ il@@ on@@ ite to J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat .
but as for the children of Israel that d@@ wel@@ t in the cities of Jud@@ ah , Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am re@@ igned over them .
then king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am sent H@@ ador@@ am that was over the tribute ; and the children of Israel st@@ oned him with stones , that he died . but king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made speed to get him up to his ch@@ ari@@ ot , to flee to Jerusalem .
speak unto Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am the son of Solomon , king of Jud@@ ah , and to all Israel in Jud@@ ah and Benjamin , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Y@@ e shall not go up , nor fight against your brethren : return every man to his house : for this thing is done of me . and they obeyed the words of the LORD , and returned from going against J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am .
for the Lev@@ ites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem : for J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest 's office unto the LORD :
and after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem , to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers .
and Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am loved Ma@@ acha@@ h the daughter of Ab@@ sal@@ om above all his wives and his conc@@ ub@@ ines : ( for he took eighteen wives , and thre@@ es@@ core conc@@ ub@@ ines ; and beg@@ at twenty and eight sons , and thre@@ es@@ core daughters . )
and Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made A@@ bi@@ jah the son of Ma@@ acha@@ h the chief , to be ruler among his brethren : for he thought to make him king .
and he dealt wisely , and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Jud@@ ah and Benjamin , unto every f@@ enced city : and he gave them vic@@ tual in abundance . and he desired many wives .
and it came to pass , when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am had established the kingdom , and had strengthened himself , he for@@ s@@ ook the law of the LORD , and all Israel with him .
and it came to pass , that in the fifth year of king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am Sh@@ is@@ hak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , because they had trans@@ g@@ ressed against the LORD ,
then came Sh@@ em@@ aiah the prophet to Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , and to the princes of Jud@@ ah , that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Sh@@ is@@ hak , and said unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , Y@@ e have for@@ s@@ aken me , and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Sh@@ is@@ hak .
and when the LORD saw that they hum@@ bled themselves , the word of the LORD came to Sh@@ em@@ aiah , saying , They have hum@@ bled themselves ; therefore I will not destroy them , but I will grant them some deliver@@ ance ; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Sh@@ is@@ hak .
nevertheless they shall be his servants ; that they may know my service , and the service of the king@@ doms of the countries .
so Sh@@ is@@ hak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD , and the treasures of the king 's house ; he took all : he carried away also the shi@@ elds of gold which Solomon had made .
instead of which king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made shi@@ elds of brass , and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard , that kept the entrance of the king 's house .
and when the king entered into the house of the LORD , the guard came and fetched them , and brought them again into the guard chamber .
now the acts of Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am , first and last , are they not written in the book of Sh@@ em@@ aiah the prophet , and of Id@@ do the se@@ er concerning gene@@ alo@@ gies ? and there were wars between Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am and J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am continually .
and A@@ bi@@ jah set the battle in array with an army of val@@ i@@ ant men of war , even four hundred thousand chosen men : J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men , being mighty men of val@@ our .
ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever , even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt ?
yet J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Ne@@ bat , the servant of Solomon the son of David , is risen up , and hath reb@@ elled against his lord .
and there are gathered unto him vain men , the children of Beli@@ al , and have strengthened themselves against Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am the son of Solomon , when Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am was young and ten@@ der@@ hearted , and could not withstand them .
and now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David ; and ye be a great multitude , and there are with you golden cal@@ ves , which J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am made you for gods .
and , behold , God himself is with us for our captain , and his priests with sounding trum@@ pets to cry alarm against you . O children of Israel , fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers ; for ye shall not prosper .
and when Jud@@ ah looked back , behold , the battle was before and behind : and they cried unto the LORD , and the priests sounded with the trum@@ pets .
thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time , and the children of Jud@@ ah prevailed , because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers .
so A@@ bi@@ jah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city of David : and As@@ a his son re@@ igned in his stead . in his days the land was quiet ten years .
and As@@ a did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God :
also he took away out of all the cities of Jud@@ ah the high places and the images : and the kingdom was quiet before him .
and As@@ a had an army of men that bare targets and spe@@ ars , out of Jud@@ ah three hundred thousand ; and out of Benjamin , that bare shi@@ elds and drew b@@ ows , two hundred and four@@ score thousand : all these were mighty men of val@@ our .
and there came out against them Zer@@ ah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand , and three hundred ch@@ ari@@ ots ; and came unto Ma@@ resha@@ h .
then As@@ a went out against him , and they set the battle in array in the valley of Z@@ ep@@ ha@@ th@@ ah at Ma@@ resha@@ h .
and they smo@@ te all the cities round about Ger@@ ar ; for the fear of the LORD came upon them : and they spoiled all the cities ; for there was exceeding much spoil in them .
now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God , and without a teaching priest , and without law .
and he gathered all Jud@@ ah and Benjamin , and the strangers with them out of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , and out of Sim@@ eon : for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance , when they saw that the LORD his God was with him .
in the six and thir@@ ti@@ eth year of the reign of As@@ a Ba@@ asha king of Israel came up against Jud@@ ah , and built Ram@@ ah , to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to As@@ a king of Jud@@ ah .
and Ben @@@ -@@ @ had@@ ad hear@@ k@@ ened unto king As@@ a , and sent the cap@@ tains of his armies against the cities of Israel ; and they smo@@ te I@@ j@@ on , and Dan , and A@@ bel @@@ -@@ @ m@@ aim , and all the store cities of N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i .
and at that time Han@@ ani the se@@ er came to As@@ a king of Jud@@ ah , and said unto him , Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria , and not relied on the LORD thy God , therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of th@@ ine hand .
then As@@ a was w@@ ro@@ th with the se@@ er , and put him in a prison house ; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing . and As@@ a oppressed some of the people the same time .
and As@@ a in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was dis@@ eased in his feet , until his disease was exceeding great : yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD , but to the physicians .
and he placed forces in all the f@@ enced cities of Jud@@ ah , and set gar@@ ris@@ ons in the land of Jud@@ ah , and in the cities of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , which As@@ a his father had taken .
but sought to the LORD God of his father , and walked in his commandments , and not after the do@@ ings of Israel .
and his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD : moreover he took away the high places and gro@@ ves out of Jud@@ ah .
also some of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines brought Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at presents , and tribute silver ; and the Arab@@ ians brought him f@@ locks , seven thousand and seven hundred r@@ ams , and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats .
and next to him was Je@@ ho@@ han@@ an the captain , and with him two hundred and four@@ score thousand .
and of Benjamin ; Eli@@ ada a mighty man of val@@ our , and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand .
and after certain years he went down to A@@ hab to Sam@@ aria . and A@@ hab killed sheep and ox@@ en for him in abundance , and for the people that he had with him , and persuaded him to go up with him to Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ Gil@@ e@@ ad .
therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men , and said unto them , Sh@@ all we go to Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ Gil@@ e@@ ad to battle , or shall I for@@ bear ? and they said , Go up ; for God will deliver it into the king 's hand .
but Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at said , Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides , that we might inqu@@ ire of him ?
and Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the son of Chen@@ a@@ an@@ ah had made him horns of iron , and said , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed .
and all the prophets prophe@@ si@@ ed so , saying , Go up to Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ Gil@@ e@@ ad , and prosper : for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king .
and the messenger that went to call Mic@@ aiah sp@@ ake to him , saying , Be@@ hold , the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one ass@@ ent ; let thy word therefore , I pray thee , be like one of theirs , and speak thou good .
and when he was come to the king , the king said unto him , Mic@@ aiah , shall we go to Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ Gil@@ e@@ ad to battle , or shall I for@@ bear ? and he said , Go ye up , and prosper , and they shall be delivered into your hand .
again he said , T@@ herefore hear the word of the LORD ; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne , and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left .
and the LORD said , Who shall enti@@ ce A@@ hab king of Israel , that he may go up and fall at Ram@@ o@@ th @@@ -@@ @ Gil@@ e@@ ad ? and one sp@@ ake saying after this manner , and another saying after that manner .
now therefore , behold , the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets , and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee .
and say , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the king , P@@ ut this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of afflic@@ tion and with water of afflic@@ tion , until I return in peace .
and the king of Israel said unto Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , I will disguise myself , and will go to the battle ; but put thou on thy robes . so the king of Israel disguised himself ; and they went to the battle .
and it came to pass , when the cap@@ tains of the ch@@ ari@@ ots saw Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , that they said , It is the king of Israel . therefore they comp@@ assed about him to fight : but Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at cried out , and the LORD helped him ; and God moved them to depart from him .
and a certain man drew a bow at a venture , and smo@@ te the king of Israel between the joints of the harness : therefore he said to his ch@@ ari@@ ot man , Turn th@@ ine hand , that thou may@@ est carry me out of the host ; for I am wounded .
and Je@@ hu the son of Han@@ ani the se@@ er went out to meet him , and said to king Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , shoul@@ dest thou help the un@@ go@@ dly , and love them that hate the LORD ? therefore is wrath upon thee from before the LORD .
and he charged them , saying , Th@@ us shall ye do in the fear of the LORD , faithfully , and with a perfect heart .
then there came some that told Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , saying , There com@@ eth a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria ; and , behold , they be Haz@@ az@@ on @@@ -@@ @ tam@@ ar , which is E@@ n @@@ -@@ @ G@@ ed@@ i .
and Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at stood in the congregation of Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem , in the house of the LORD , before the new court ,
and said , O LORD God of our fathers , art not thou God in heaven ? and rul@@ est not thou over all the king@@ doms of the he@@ a@@ then ? and in th@@ ine hand is there not power and might , so that none is able to withstand thee ?
art not thou our God , who did@@ st drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel , and g@@ av@@ est it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever ?
and now , behold , the children of Am@@ mon and Mo@@ ab and mount Se@@ ir , whom thou w@@ oul@@ dest not let Israel invade , when they came out of the land of Egypt , but they turned from them , and destroyed them not ;
behold , I say , how they reward us , to come to cast us out of thy possession , which thou hast given us to inherit .
and he said , hear@@ ken ye , all Jud@@ ah , and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem , and thou king Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD unto you , Be not afraid nor dis@@ may@@ ed by reason of this great multitude ; for the battle is not yours , but God 's .
and Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at bowed his head with his face to the ground : and all Jud@@ ah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD , wor@@ shipping the LORD .
and when he had consulted with the people , he appointed singers unto the LORD , and that should praise the beauty of hol@@ iness , as they went out before the army , and to say , P@@ raise the LORD ; for his mercy endu@@ re@@ th for ever .
and when Jud@@ ah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness , they looked unto the multitude , and , behold , they were dead bodies fallen to the earth , and none escaped .
and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Ber@@ acha@@ h ; for there they blessed the LORD : therefore the name of the same place was called , The valley of Ber@@ acha@@ h , unto this day .
then they returned , every man of Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem , and Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at in the forefront of them , to go again to Jerusalem with joy ; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies .
and the fear of God was on all the king@@ doms of those countries , when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel .
and Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at re@@ igned over Jud@@ ah : he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned twenty and five years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Az@@ ub@@ ah the daughter of Sh@@ il@@ hi .
How@@ be@@ it the high places were not taken away : for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers .
and he had brethren the sons of Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , Az@@ ari@@ ah , and Je@@ hi@@ el , and Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , and Az@@ ari@@ ah , and Michael , and Sh@@ eph@@ ati@@ ah : all these were the sons of Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at king of Israel .
and their father gave them great gifts of silver , and of gold , and of precious things , with f@@ enced cities in Jud@@ ah : but the kingdom gave he to Je@@ hor@@ am ; because he was the fir@@ st@@ born .
Je@@ hor@@ am was thirty and two years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned eight years in Jerusalem .
How@@ be@@ it the LORD would not destroy the house of David , because of the covenant that he had made with David , and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever .
then Je@@ hor@@ am went forth with his princes , and all his ch@@ ari@@ ots with him : and he rose up by night , and smo@@ te the E@@ dom@@ ites which comp@@ assed him in , and the cap@@ tains of the ch@@ ari@@ ots .
moreover he made high places in the mountains of Jud@@ ah , and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit for@@ n@@ ication , and compelled Jud@@ ah there@@ to .
but hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel , and hast made Jud@@ ah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a wh@@ oring , like to the wh@@ ore@@ doms of the house of A@@ hab , and also hast sl@@ ain thy brethren of thy father 's house , which were better than thy@@ self :
thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned in Jerusalem eight years , and departed without being desired . How@@ be@@ it they buried him in the city of David , but not in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of the kings .
and the inhabitants of Jerusalem made A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah his youngest son king in his stead : for the band of men that came with the Arab@@ ians to the camp had sl@@ ain all the el@@ dest . so A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ hor@@ am king of Jud@@ ah re@@ igned .
forty and two years old was A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned one year in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Ath@@ ali@@ ah the daughter of Om@@ ri .
but when Ath@@ ali@@ ah the mother of A@@ haz@@ i@@ ah saw that her son was dead , she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Jud@@ ah .
and all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God . and he said unto them , Be@@ hold , the king 's son shall reign , as the LORD hath said of the sons of David .
but let none come into the house of the LORD , save the priests , and they that minister of the Lev@@ ites ; they shall go in , for they are holy : but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD .
and he set all the people , every man having his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple , along by the altar and the temple , by the king round about .
then they brought out the king 's son , and put upon him the crown , and gave him the testimony , and made him king . and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada and his sons ano@@ inted him , and said , God save the king .
now when Ath@@ ali@@ ah heard the noise of the people running and pra@@ ising the king , she came to the people into the house of the LORD :
so they laid hands on her ; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king 's house , they sle@@ w her there .
and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada made a covenant between him , and between all the people , and between the king , that they should be the LORD 's people .
then all the people went to the house of Ba@@ al , and brake it down , and brake his al@@ t@@ ars and his images in pieces , and sle@@ w M@@ attan the priest of Ba@@ al before the al@@ t@@ ars .
and he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD , that none which was un@@ clean in any thing should enter in .
Jo@@ ash was seven years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned forty years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Zi@@ bi@@ ah of Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba .
and at the king 's commandment they made a chest , and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD .
and they made a pro@@ clamation through Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem , to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness .
and all the princes and all the people rejo@@ iced , and brought in , and cast into the chest , until they had made an end .
yet he sent prophets to them , to bring them again unto the LORD ; and they testified against them : but they would not give ear .
and they con@@ spi@@ red against him , and st@@ oned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD .
thus Jo@@ ash the king remembered not the kindness which Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada his father had done to him , but sle@@ w his son . and when he died , he said , The LORD look upon it , and require it .
for the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men , and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand , because they had for@@ s@@ aken the LORD God of their fathers . so they executed judgment against Jo@@ ash .
and these are they that con@@ spi@@ red against him ; Z@@ abad the son of Shim@@ e@@ ath an Am@@ monit@@ ess , and Je@@ ho@@ z@@ abad the son of Shim@@ rit@@ h a Mo@@ ab@@ it@@ ess .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , but not with a perfect heart .
now it came to pass , when the kingdom was established to him , that he sle@@ w his servants that had killed the king his father .
but there came a man of God to him , saying , O king , let not the army of Israel go with thee ; for the LORD is not with Israel , to w@@ it , with all the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
but if thou wil@@ t go , do it , be strong for the battle : God shall make thee fall before the enemy : for God hath power to help , and to cast down .
and Ama@@ zi@@ ah strengthened himself , and led forth his people , and went to the valley of salt , and smo@@ te of the Chi@@ dren of Se@@ ir ten thousand .
and other ten thousand left alive did the children of Jud@@ ah carry away captive , and brought them unto the top of the rock , and cast them down from the top of the rock , that they all were broken in pieces .
but the soldiers of the army which Ama@@ zi@@ ah sent back , that they should not go with him to battle , fell upon the cities of Jud@@ ah , from Sam@@ aria even unto B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ hor@@ on , and smo@@ te three thousand of them , and took much spoil .
W@@ herefore the anger of the LORD was kind@@ led against Ama@@ zi@@ ah , and he sent unto him a prophet , which said unto him , Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people , which could not deliver their own people out of th@@ ine hand ?
then Ama@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah took advice , and sent to Jo@@ ash , the son of Je@@ ho@@ a@@ haz , the son of Je@@ hu , king of Israel , saying , Come , let us see one another in the face .
thou say@@ est , L@@ o , thou hast sm@@ it@@ ten the E@@ dom@@ ites ; and th@@ ine heart lif@@ t@@ eth thee up to boast : abide now at home ; why shoul@@ dest thou med@@ dle to th@@ ine hurt , that thou shoul@@ dest fall , even thou , and Jud@@ ah with thee ?
and Jud@@ ah was put to the worse before Israel , and they fled every man to his tent .
and he took all the gold and the silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with O@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ E@@ dom , and the treasures of the king 's house , the hostages also , and returned to Sam@@ aria .
now after the time that Ama@@ zi@@ ah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem ; and he fled to L@@ ach@@ ish : but they sent to L@@ ach@@ ish after him , and sle@@ w him there .
sixteen years old was Uz@@ zi@@ ah when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned fifty and two years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was J@@ ec@@ oli@@ ah of Jerusalem .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , according to all that his father Ama@@ zi@@ ah did .
and he sought God in the days of Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , who had understanding in the visions of God : and as long as he sought the LORD , God made him to prosper .
and he went forth and war@@ red against the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and brake down the wall of G@@ ath , and the wall of Jab@@ ne@@ h , and the wall of Ash@@ do@@ d , and built cities about Ash@@ do@@ d , and among the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and the Am@@ mon@@ ites gave gifts to Uz@@ zi@@ ah : and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt ; for he strengthened himself exceedingly .
moreover Uz@@ zi@@ ah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate , and at the valley gate , and at the turning of the wall , and fortified them .
moreover Uz@@ zi@@ ah had an host of fighting men , that went out to war by bands , according to the number of their account by the hand of J@@ ei@@ el the scri@@ be and Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah the ruler , under the hand of Han@@ ani@@ ah , one of the king 's cap@@ tains .
and under their hand was an army , three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred , that made war with mighty power , to help the king against the enemy .
and he made in Jerusalem engines , invented by cunning men , to be on the towers and upon the bul@@ war@@ ks , to shoot arrows and great stones with@@ al . and his name spread far abroad ; for he was marv@@ ell@@ ously helped , till he was strong .
but when he was strong , his heart was lifted up to his destruction : for he trans@@ g@@ ressed against the LORD his God , and went into the temple of the LORD to burn inc@@ ense upon the altar of inc@@ ense .
and Az@@ ari@@ ah the priest went in after him , and with him four@@ score priests of the LORD , that were val@@ i@@ ant men :
then Uz@@ zi@@ ah was w@@ ro@@ th , and had a cen@@ ser in his hand to burn inc@@ ense : and while he was w@@ ro@@ th with the priests , the le@@ pro@@ sy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD , from beside the inc@@ ense altar .
and Az@@ ari@@ ah the chief priest , and all the priests , looked upon him , and , behold , he was le@@ pr@@ ous in his forehead , and they thrust him out from th@@ ence ; ye@@ a , himself ha@@ sted also to go out , because the LORD had sm@@ it@@ ten him .
and Uz@@ zi@@ ah the king was a le@@ per unto the day of his death , and d@@ wel@@ t in a several house , being a le@@ per ; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD : and Jo@@ th@@ am his son was over the king 's house , judging the people of the land .
so Uz@@ zi@@ ah slept with his fathers , and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings ; for they said , He is a le@@ per : and Jo@@ th@@ am his son re@@ igned in his stead .
Jo@@ th@@ am was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned sixteen years in Jerusalem . his mother 's name also was Jerus@@ ha@@ h , the daughter of Z@@ ad@@ ok .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , according to all that his father Uz@@ zi@@ ah did : How@@ be@@ it he entered not into the temple of the LORD . and the people did yet corrup@@ tly .
A@@ haz was twenty years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned sixteen years in Jerusalem : but he did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD , like David his father :
moreover he burnt inc@@ ense in the valley of the son of H@@ inno@@ m , and burnt his children in the fire , after the ab@@ om@@ inations of the he@@ a@@ then whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel .
he sacrificed also and burnt inc@@ ense in the high places , and on the hills , and under every green tree .
for Pe@@ k@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah sle@@ w in Jud@@ ah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day , which were all val@@ i@@ ant men ; because they had for@@ s@@ aken the LORD God of their fathers .
and Z@@ ich@@ ri , a mighty man of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , sle@@ w Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah the king 's son , and Az@@ ri@@ k@@ am the governor of the house , and El@@ kan@@ ah that was next to the king .
and now ye purpose to keep under the children of Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem for bond@@ men and bond@@ women unto you : but are there not with you , even with you , sins against the LORD your God ?
now hear me therefore , and deliver the cap@@ tives again , which ye have taken captive of your brethren : for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you .
then certain of the heads of the children of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , Az@@ ari@@ ah the son of Johan@@ an , Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah the son of M@@ esh@@ ill@@ emo@@ th , and Je@@ hi@@ z@@ ki@@ ah the son of Sh@@ all@@ um , and A@@ mas@@ a the son of Had@@ la@@ i , stood up against them that came from the war ,
and A@@ haz slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the city , even in Jerusalem : but they brought him not into the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of the kings of Israel : and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah his son re@@ igned in his stead .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , according to all that David his father had done .
he in the first year of his reign , in the first month , opened the doors of the house of the LORD , and repaired them .
and said unto them , He@@ ar me , ye Lev@@ ites , sancti@@ fy now yourselves , and sancti@@ fy the house of the LORD God of your fathers , and carry forth the fil@@ thiness out of the holy place .
for our fathers have t@@ resp@@ assed , and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God , and have for@@ s@@ aken him , and have turned away their faces from the hab@@ itation of the LORD , and turned their backs .
now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel , that his fierce wrath may turn away from us .
my sons , be not now neg@@ lig@@ ent : for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before him , to serve him , and that ye should minister unto him , and burn inc@@ ense .
and of the sons of Eliz@@ aph@@ an ; Shim@@ ri , and J@@ ei@@ el : and of the sons of As@@ ap@@ h ; Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , and M@@ att@@ ani@@ ah :
and of the sons of h@@ eman ; Je@@ hi@@ el , and Shim@@ ei : and of the sons of J@@ ed@@ u@@ thu@@ n ; Sh@@ em@@ aiah , and Uz@@ zi@@ el .
then they went in to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah the king , and said , We have cleans@@ ed all the house of the LORD , and the altar of burnt offering , with all the vessels thereof , and the sh@@ ew@@ bread table , with all the vessels thereof .
moreover all the vessels , which king A@@ haz in his reign did cast away in his trans@@ g@@ ression , have we prepared and sancti@@ fied , and , behold , they are before the altar of the LORD .
then He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah the king rose early , and gathered the rulers of the city , and went up to the house of the LORD .
and they brought seven bul@@ locks , and seven r@@ ams , and seven lam@@ bs , and seven he goats , for a sin offering for the kingdom , and for the sanctuary , and for Jud@@ ah . and he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD .
and he set the Lev@@ ites in the house of the LORD with cy@@ mb@@ als , with p@@ sal@@ ter@@ ies , and with har@@ ps , according to the commandment of David , and of G@@ ad the king 's se@@ er , and Na@@ than the prophet : for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets .
and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar . and when the burnt offering began , the song of the LORD began also with the trum@@ pets , and with the instruments ordained by David king of Israel .
and all the congregation wor@@ shipped , and the singers sang , and the trum@@ pet@@ ers sounded : and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished .
and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah sent to all Israel and Jud@@ ah , and wrote letters also to E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem , to keep the pas@@ sover unto the LORD God of Israel .
for the king had taken counsel , and his princes , and all the congregation in Jerusalem , to keep the pas@@ sover in the second month .
now be ye not sti@@ ff@@ nec@@ ked , as your fathers were , but yield yourselves unto the LORD , and enter into his sanctuary , which he hath sancti@@ fied for ever : and serve the LORD your God , that the fierc@@ eness of his wrath may turn away from you .
so the posts passed from city to city through the country of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h even unto Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n : but they laughed them to scor@@ n , and mo@@ cked them .
also in Jud@@ ah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes , by the word of the LORD .
and they stood in their place after their manner , according to the law of Moses the man of God : the priests sprink@@ led the blood , which they received of the hand of the Lev@@ ites .
and the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of un@@ leav@@ ened bread seven days with great gl@@ ad@@ ness : and the Lev@@ ites and the priests praised the LORD day by day , singing with loud instruments unto the LORD .
and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah sp@@ ake comfortably unto all the Lev@@ ites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD : and they did eat throughout the feast seven days , offering peace offerings , and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers .
and all the congregation of Jud@@ ah , with the priests and the Lev@@ ites , and all the congregation that came out of Israel , and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel , and that d@@ wel@@ t in Jud@@ ah , rejo@@ iced .
moreover he commanded the people that d@@ wel@@ t in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Lev@@ ites , that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD .
and concerning the children of Israel and Jud@@ ah , that d@@ wel@@ t in the cities of Jud@@ ah , they also brought in the ti@@ the of ox@@ en and sheep , and the ti@@ the of holy things which were consec@@ rated unto the LORD their God , and laid them by he@@ aps .
and K@@ ore the son of Im@@ n@@ ah the Lev@@ ite , the porter toward the east , was over the fre@@ e@@ will offerings of God , to distribute the ob@@ l@@ ations of the LORD , and the most holy things .
and next him were Eden , and Min@@ i@@ amin , and Jes@@ hua , and Sh@@ em@@ aiah , A@@ mari@@ ah , and Sh@@ ec@@ ani@@ ah , in the cities of the priests , in their set office , to give to their brethren by courses , as well to the great as to the small :
beside their gen@@ eal@@ ogy of males , from three years old and upward , even unto every one that enter@@ eth into the house of the LORD , his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses ;
both to the gen@@ eal@@ ogy of the priests by the house of their fathers , and the Lev@@ ites from twenty years old and upward , in their charges by their courses ;
and in every work that he began in the service of the house of God , and in the law , and in the commandments , to seek his God , he did it with all his heart , and prosper@@ ed .
after these things , and the establishment thereof , Sen@@ n@@ ach@@ eri@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ria came , and entered into Jud@@ ah , and enc@@ amped against the f@@ enced cities , and thought to win them for himself .
and when He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah saw that Sen@@ n@@ ach@@ eri@@ b was come , and that he was pur@@ posed to fight against Jerusalem ,
he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the foun@@ tains which were without the city : and they did help him .
so there was gathered much people together , who stopped all the foun@@ tains , and the bro@@ ok that ran through the midst of the land , saying , Why should the kings of As@@ sy@@ ria come , and find much water ?
also he strengthened himself , and built up all the wall that was broken , and raised it up to the towers , and another wall without , and repaired Mill@@ o in the city of David , and made dar@@ ts and shi@@ elds in abundance .
and he set cap@@ tains of war over the people , and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city , and sp@@ ake comfortably to them , saying ,
be strong and courageous , be not afraid nor dis@@ may@@ ed for the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , nor for all the multitude that is with him : for there be more with us than with him :
with him is an arm of flesh ; but with us is the LORD our God to help us , and to fight our battles . and the people rested themselves upon the words of He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah .
do@@ th not He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst , saying , The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria ?
hath not the same He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah taken away his high places and his al@@ t@@ ars , and commanded Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem , saying , Y@@ e shall worship before one altar , and burn inc@@ ense upon it ?
know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands ? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand ?
who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of mine hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand ?
then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall , to aff@@ right them , and to trouble them ; that they might take the city .
and for this cause He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah the king , and the prophet Isaiah the son of A@@ mo@@ z , prayed and cried to heaven .
and many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem , and presents to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah : so that he was magni@@ fied in the sight of all nations from th@@ ence@@ forth .
in those days He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah was sick to the death , and prayed unto the LORD : and he sp@@ ake unto him , and he gave him a sign .
but He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him ; for his heart was lifted up : therefore there was wrath upon him , and upon Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem .
notwithstanding He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah hum@@ bled himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah .
How@@ be@@ it in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon , who sent unto him to inqu@@ ire of the wonder that was done in the land , God left him , to try him , that he might know all that was in his heart .
and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the chief@@ est of the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of the sons of David : and all Jud@@ ah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death . and Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his son re@@ igned in his stead .
for he built again the high places which He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah his father had broken down , and he re@@ ared up al@@ t@@ ars for Ba@@ ali@@ m , and made gro@@ ves , and wor@@ shipped all the host of heaven , and served them .
also he built al@@ t@@ ars in the house of the LORD , where@@ of the LORD had said , In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever .
so Man@@ as@@ se@@ h made Jud@@ ah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to er@@ r , and to do worse than the he@@ a@@ then , whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel .
W@@ herefore the LORD brought upon them the cap@@ tains of the host of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , which took Man@@ as@@ se@@ h among the thor@@ ns , and bound him with fet@@ ters , and carried him to Babylon .
and when he was in afflic@@ tion , he bes@@ ought the LORD his God , and hum@@ bled himself greatly before the God of his fathers ,
and he repaired the altar of the LORD , and sacrificed there@@ on peace offerings and thank offerings , and commanded Jud@@ ah to serve the LORD God of Israel .
but he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , as did Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his father : for Am@@ on sacrificed unto all the carved images which Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his father had made , and served them ;
but the people of the land sle@@ w all them that had con@@ spi@@ red against king Am@@ on ; and the people of the land made Jo@@ si@@ ah his son king in his stead .
and he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD , and walked in the ways of David his father , and declined neither to the right hand , nor to the left .
and when he had broken down the al@@ t@@ ars and the gro@@ ves , and had beaten the gra@@ ven images into powder , and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel , he returned to Jerusalem .
now in the eighteenth year of his reign , when he had pur@@ ged the land , and the house , he sent Sha@@ ph@@ an the son of Az@@ ali@@ ah , and Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah the governor of the city , and Jo@@ ah the son of Jo@@ a@@ haz the recorder , to repair the house of the LORD his God .
and they put it in the hand of the work@@ men that had the oversight of the house of the LORD , and they gave it to the work@@ men that wrought in the house of the LORD , to repair and amend the house :
even to the arti@@ fic@@ ers and builders gave they it , to buy he@@ wn stone , and timber for cou@@ pl@@ ings , and to floor the houses which the kings of Jud@@ ah had destroyed .
also they were over the bearers of burdens , and were over@@ se@@ ers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service : and of the Lev@@ ites there were scri@@ bes , and officers , and porters .
and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD , Hil@@ ki@@ ah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses .
and Hil@@ ki@@ ah answered and said to Sha@@ ph@@ an the scri@@ be , I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD . and Hil@@ ki@@ ah delivered the book to Sha@@ ph@@ an .
and Sha@@ ph@@ an carried the book to the king , and brought the king word back again , saying , All that was committed to thy servants , they do it .
and the king commanded Hil@@ ki@@ ah , and A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and Ab@@ don the son of Mic@@ ah , and Sha@@ ph@@ an the scri@@ be , and As@@ aiah a servant of the king 's , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Be@@ hold , I will bring evil upon this place , and upon the inhabitants thereof , even all the cur@@ ses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Jud@@ ah :
behold , I will gather thee to thy fathers , and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace , neither shall th@@ ine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place , and upon the inhabitants of the same . so they brought the king word again .
and he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it . and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God , the God of their fathers .
moreover Jo@@ si@@ ah kept a pas@@ sover unto the LORD in Jerusalem : and they killed the pas@@ sover on the four@@ teenth day of the first month .
and prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers , after your courses , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
and stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people , and after the division of the families of the Lev@@ ites .
so kill the pas@@ sover , and sancti@@ fy yourselves , and prepare your brethren , that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses .
and his princes gave willingly unto the people , to the priests , and to the Lev@@ ites : Hil@@ ki@@ ah and Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah and Je@@ hi@@ el , rulers of the house of God , gave unto the priests for the pas@@ sover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle , and three hundred ox@@ en .
so the service was prepared , and the priests stood in their place , and the Lev@@ ites in their courses , according to the king 's commandment .
and they removed the burnt offerings , that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people , to offer unto the LORD , as it is written in the book of Moses . and so did they with the ox@@ en .
and they ro@@ asted the pas@@ sover with fire according to the ordin@@ ance : but the other holy offerings so@@ d they in pots , and in cal@@ dr@@ ons , and in p@@ ans , and divided them spe@@ ed@@ ily among all the people .
and afterward they made ready for themselves , and for the priests : because the priests the sons of Aaron were busi@@ ed in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night ; therefore the Lev@@ ites prepared for themselves , and for the priests the sons of Aaron .
nevertheless Jo@@ si@@ ah would not turn his face from him , but disguised himself , that he might fight with him , and hear@@ k@@ ened not unto the words of N@@ echo from the mouth of God , and came to fight in the valley of Me@@ gi@@ d@@ do .
and his deeds , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Jud@@ ah .
and the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem , and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned eleven years in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God .
Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon , and put them in his temple at Babylon .
now the rest of the acts of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im , and his ab@@ om@@ inations which he did , and that which was found in him , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Jud@@ ah : and Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in his son re@@ igned in his stead .
Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ach@@ in was eight years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned three months and ten days in Jerusalem : and he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD .
and when the year was expired , king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar sent , and brought him to Babylon , with the goo@@ dly vessels of the house of the LORD , and made Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah his brother king over Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem .
moreover all the chief of the priests , and the people , trans@@ g@@ ressed very much after all the ab@@ om@@ inations of the he@@ a@@ then ; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hal@@ lowed in Jerusalem .
and the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers , rising up be@@ times , and sending ; because he had compassion on his people , and on his dwelling place :
and they burnt the house of God , and brake down the wall of Jerusalem , and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire , and destroyed all the goo@@ dly vessels thereof .
and them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon ; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia :
thus sa@@ ith Cy@@ rus king of Persia , The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the king@@ doms of the earth ; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem , which is in Jud@@ ah .
then rose up the chief of the fathers of Jud@@ ah and Benjamin , and the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , with all them whose spirit God had raised , to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem .
and all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver , with gold , with goods , and with beasts , and with precious things , beside all that was willingly offered .
even those did Cy@@ rus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mi@@ thre@@ dat@@ h the treas@@ u@@ rer , and numbered them unto Sh@@ esh@@ b@@ azz@@ ar , the prince of Jud@@ ah .
and this is the number of them : thirty char@@ gers of gold , a thousand char@@ gers of silver , nine and twenty kni@@ ves ,
all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred . all these did Sh@@ esh@@ b@@ azz@@ ar bring up with them of the cap@@ tivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem .
which came with Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el : Jes@@ hua , Ne@@ h@@ emi@@ ah , Ser@@ aiah , Re@@ el@@ aiah , Mor@@ dec@@ ai , Bil@@ shan , Mis@@ par , B@@ ig@@ v@@ ai , Re@@ h@@ um , Ba@@ an@@ ah . the number of the men of the people of Israel :
the Lev@@ ites : the children of Jes@@ hua and Kad@@ mi@@ el , of the children of H@@ od@@ avi@@ ah , seventy and four .
the children of Sh@@ eph@@ ati@@ ah , the children of Hat@@ til , the children of Po@@ cher@@ eth of Ze@@ bai@@ m , the children of Am@@ i .
and the Tir@@ sha@@ tha said unto them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , till there stood up a priest with Uri@@ m and with T@@ hum@@ mi@@ m .
beside their servants and their m@@ aids , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven : and there were among them two hundred singing men and singing women .
their cam@@ els , four hundred thirty and five ; their asses , six thousand seven hundred and twenty .
and some of the chief of the fathers , when they came to the house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem , offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place :
they gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work thre@@ es@@ core and one thousand dr@@ ams of gold , and five thousand pound of silver , and one hundred priests ' garments .
so the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , and some of the people , and the singers , and the porters , and the Ne@@ thin@@ ims , d@@ wel@@ t in their cities , and all Israel in their cities .
and when the seventh month was come , and the children of Israel were in the cities , the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem .
then stood up Jes@@ hua the son of Jo@@ z@@ ad@@ ak , and his brethren the priests , and Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el the son of S@@ heal@@ ti@@ el , and his brethren , and buil@@ ded the altar of the God of Israel , to offer burnt offerings there@@ on , as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God .
and they set the altar upon his bases ; for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries : and they offered burnt offerings there@@ on unto the LORD , even burnt offerings morning and evening .
and when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD , they set the priests in their app@@ arel with trum@@ pets , and the Lev@@ ites the sons of As@@ ap@@ h with cy@@ mb@@ als , to praise the LORD , after the ordin@@ ance of David king of Israel .
but many of the priests and Lev@@ ites and chief of the fathers , who were ancient men , that had seen the first house , when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes , we@@ pt with a loud voice ; and many shouted aloud for joy :
now when the adversaries of Jud@@ ah and Benjamin heard that the children of the cap@@ tivity buil@@ ded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel ;
then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Jud@@ ah , and troubled them in building ,
then wrote Re@@ h@@ um the chancellor , and Shim@@ sha@@ i the scri@@ be , and the rest of their companions ; the Din@@ a@@ ites , the A@@ ph@@ ar@@ s@@ ath@@ ch@@ ites , the Tar@@ pel@@ ites , the A@@ ph@@ ar@@ sites , the Arch@@ ev@@ ites , the Bab@@ yl@@ onians , the Sus@@ anch@@ ites , the De@@ ha@@ v@@ ites , and the E@@ lam@@ ites ,
this is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him , even unto Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ xes the king ; Th@@ y servants the men on this side the river , and at such a time .
be it known unto the king , that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem , building the rebelli@@ ous and the bad city , and have set up the walls thereof , and joined the foundations .
be it known now unto the king , that , if this city be buil@@ ded , and the walls set up again , then will they not pay toll , tribute , and custom , and so thou shalt end@@ am@@ age the revenue of the kings .
now because we have maintenance from the king 's palace , and it was not meet for us to see the king 's dis@@ honour , therefore have we sent and certified the king ;
we certi@@ fy the king that , if this city be buil@@ ded again , and the walls thereof set up , by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river .
now when the copy of king Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ xes ' letter was read before Re@@ h@@ um , and Shim@@ sha@@ i the scri@@ be , and their companions , they went up in ha@@ ste to Jerusalem unto the Jews , and made them to cease by force and power .
then ceased the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem . so it ceased unto the second year of the reign of D@@ arius king of Persia .
then the prophets , H@@ agg@@ ai the prophet , and Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah the son of Id@@ do , prophe@@ si@@ ed unto the Jews that were in Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel , even unto them .
then rose up Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el the son of S@@ heal@@ ti@@ el , and Jes@@ hua the son of Jo@@ z@@ ad@@ ak , and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem : and with them were the prophets of God helping them .
at the same time came to them Tat@@ n@@ ai , governor on this side the river , and She@@ th@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ bo@@ z@@ n@@ ai , and their companions , and said thus unto them , Who hath commanded you to build this house , and to make up this wall ?
but the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews , that they could not cause them to cease , till the matter came to D@@ arius : and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter .
the copy of the letter that Tat@@ n@@ ai , governor on this side the river , and She@@ th@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ bo@@ z@@ n@@ ai , and his companions the A@@ ph@@ ar@@ s@@ ach@@ ites , which were on this side the river , sent unto D@@ arius the king :
but after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath , he gave them into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king of Babylon , the Chal@@ dean , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Babylon .
but in the first year of Cy@@ rus the king of Babylon the same king Cy@@ rus made a decree to build this house of God .
and said unto him , Take these vessels , go , carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem , and let the house of God be buil@@ ded in his place .
with three rows of great stones , and a row of new timber : and let the expen@@ ces be given out of the king 's house :
now therefore , Tat@@ n@@ ai , governor beyond the river , She@@ th@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ bo@@ z@@ n@@ ai , and your companions the A@@ ph@@ ar@@ s@@ ach@@ ites , which are beyond the river , be ye far from th@@ ence :
let the work of this house of God alone ; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place .
then Tat@@ n@@ ai , governor on this side the river , She@@ th@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ bo@@ z@@ n@@ ai , and their companions , according to that which D@@ arius the king had sent , so they did spe@@ ed@@ ily .
and offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bul@@ locks , two hundred r@@ ams , four hundred lam@@ bs ; and for a sin offering for all Israel , twelve he goats , according to the number of the tribes of Israel .
and the children of the cap@@ tivity kept the pas@@ sover upon the four@@ teenth day of the first month .
now after these things , in the reign of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ xes king of Persia , E@@ z@@ ra the son of Ser@@ aiah , the son of Az@@ ari@@ ah , the son of Hil@@ ki@@ ah ,
this E@@ z@@ ra went up from Babylon ; and he was a ready scri@@ be in the law of Moses , which the LORD God of Israel had given : and the king granted him all his request , according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him .
for upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon , and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem , according to the good hand of his God upon him .
I make a decree , that all they of the people of Israel , and of his priests and Lev@@ ites , in my realm , which are minded of their own fre@@ e@@ will to go up to Jerusalem , go with thee .
for@@ as@@ much as thou art sent of the king , and of his seven counsel@@ lers , to inqu@@ ire concerning Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem , according to the law of thy God which is in th@@ ine hand ;
and to carry the silver and gold , which the king and his counsel@@ lers have freely offered unto the God of Israel , whose hab@@ itation is in Jerusalem ,
and all the silver and gold that thou can@@ st find in all the province of Babylon , with the fre@@ e@@ will offering of the people , and of the priests , offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem :
that thou may@@ est buy spe@@ ed@@ ily with this money bul@@ locks , r@@ ams , lam@@ bs , with their meat offerings and their drink offerings , and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem .
the vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God , those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem .
whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven , let it be dilig@@ ently done for the house of the God of heaven : for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons ?
also we certi@@ fy you , that touching any of the priests and Lev@@ ites , singers , porters , Ne@@ thin@@ ims , or ministers of this house of God , it shall not be lawful to impose toll , tribute , or custom , upon them .
and wh@@ oso@@ ever will not do the law of thy God , and the law of the king , let judgment be executed spe@@ ed@@ ily upon him , whether it be unto death , or to ban@@ ishment , or to confisc@@ ation of goods , or to imprisonment .
of the sons of Sh@@ echan@@ i@@ ah , of the sons of Phar@@ osh ; Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah : and with him were reck@@ oned by gen@@ eal@@ ogy of the males an hundred and fifty .
and I gathered them together to the river that run@@ neth to A@@ ha@@ va ; and there ab@@ ode we in tents three days : and I viewed the people , and the priests , and found there none of the sons of Lev@@ i .
then sent I for Eli@@ ez@@ er , for Ari@@ el , for Sh@@ em@@ aiah , and for El@@ na@@ than , and for J@@ ari@@ b , and for El@@ na@@ than , and for Na@@ than , and for Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , and for M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lam , chief men ; also for Jo@@ i@@ ari@@ b , and for El@@ na@@ than , men of understanding .
and I sent them with commandment unto Id@@ do the chief at the place C@@ asi@@ phia , and I told them what they should say unto Id@@ do , and to his brethren the Ne@@ thin@@ ims , at the place C@@ asi@@ phia , that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God .
also of the Ne@@ thin@@ ims , whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Lev@@ ites , two hundred and twenty Ne@@ thin@@ ims : all of them were expressed by name .
then I proclaimed a fast there , at the river of A@@ ha@@ va , that we might aff@@ l@@ ict ourselves before our God , to seek of him a right way for us , and for our little ones , and for all our substance .
and weighed unto them the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , even the offering of the house of our God , which the king , and his counsel@@ lers , and his lords , and all Israel there present , had offered :
and I said unto them , Y@@ e are holy unto the LORD ; the vessels are holy also ; and the silver and the gold are a fre@@ e@@ will offering unto the LORD God of your fathers .
watch ye , and keep them , until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the Lev@@ ites , and chief of the fathers of Israel , at Jerusalem , in the chambers of the house of the LORD .
so took the priests and the Lev@@ ites the weight of the silver , and the gold , and the vessels , to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God .
then we departed from the river of A@@ ha@@ va on the twel@@ fth day of the first month , to go unto Jerusalem : and the hand of our God was upon us , and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy , and of such as lay in wait by the way .
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves , and for their sons : so that the holy seed have ming@@ led themselves with the people of those lands : ye@@ a , the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this t@@ resp@@ ass .
and when I heard this thing , I rent my garment and my mantle , and pl@@ ucked off the hair of my head and of my beard , and sat down aston@@ ied .
and at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heav@@ iness ; and having rent my garment and my mantle , I fell upon my knees , and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God .
and said , O my God , I am ashamed and bl@@ ush to lift up my face to thee , my God : for our ini@@ qu@@ ities are increased over our head , and our t@@ resp@@ ass is grown up unto the heavens .
now when E@@ z@@ ra had prayed , and when he had confessed , we@@ eping and casting himself down before the house of God , there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children : for the people we@@ pt very sore .
and Sh@@ echan@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ hi@@ el , one of the sons of EL@@ AM , answered and said unto E@@ z@@ ra , We have t@@ resp@@ assed against our God , and have taken strange wives of the people of the land : yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing .
arise ; for this matter belong@@ eth unto thee : we also will be with thee : be of good courage , and do it .
then arose E@@ z@@ ra , and made the chief priests , the Lev@@ ites , and all Israel , to swear that they should do according to this word . and they sw@@ are .
and they made pro@@ clamation throughout Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the cap@@ tivity , that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem ;
and that wh@@ oso@@ ever would not come within three days , according to the counsel of the princes and the elders , all his substance should be forfe@@ ited , and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away .
and E@@ z@@ ra the priest stood up , and said unto them , Y@@ e have trans@@ g@@ ressed , and have taken strange wives , to increase the t@@ resp@@ ass of Israel .
now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers , and do his pleasure : and separate yourselves from the people of the land , and from the strange wives .
but the people are many , and it is a time of much rain , and we are not able to stand without , neither is this a work of one day or two : for we are many that have trans@@ g@@ ressed in this thing .
and they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month .
and among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives : namely , of the sons of Jes@@ hua the son of Jo@@ z@@ ad@@ ak , and his brethren ; Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah , and Eli@@ ez@@ er , and J@@ ari@@ b , and G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah .
and of the sons of H@@ ari@@ m ; Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah , and Elijah , and Sh@@ em@@ aiah , and Je@@ hi@@ el , and Uz@@ zi@@ ah .
moreover of Israel : of the sons of Par@@ osh ; Ram@@ i@@ ah , and J@@ ez@@ i@@ ah , and Mal@@ chi@@ ah , and Mi@@ amin , and Ele@@ az@@ ar , and Mal@@ chi@@ jah , and Ben@@ aiah .
and of the sons of EL@@ AM ; M@@ att@@ ani@@ ah , Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , and Je@@ hi@@ el , and Ab@@ di , and Jer@@ emo@@ th , and Eli@@ ah .
the words of Ne@@ h@@ emi@@ ah the son of H@@ ach@@ ali@@ ah . and it came to pass in the month Ch@@ is@@ le@@ u , in the twentieth year , as I was in Sh@@ ush@@ an the palace ,
that Han@@ ani , one of my brethren , came , he and certain men of Jud@@ ah ; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped , which were left of the cap@@ tivity , and concerning Jerusalem .
and they said unto me , The remn@@ ant that are left of the cap@@ tivity there in the province are in great afflic@@ tion and repro@@ ach : the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down , and the gates thereof are burned with fire .
and said , I bes@@ e@@ ech thee , O LORD God of heaven , the great and terrible God , that keep@@ eth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments :
we have dealt very corrup@@ tly against thee , and have not kept the commandments , nor the statutes , nor the judgments , which thou comman@@ ded@@ st thy servant Moses .
now these are thy servants and thy people , whom thou hast re@@ deemed by thy great power , and by thy strong hand .
W@@ herefore the king said unto me , Why is thy coun@@ tenance sad , seeing thou art not sick ? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart . then I was very sore afraid ,
and said unto the king , Let the king live for ever : why should not my coun@@ tenance be sad , when the city , the place of my fathers ' se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res , li@@ eth waste , and the gates thereof are consumed with fire ?
and I said unto the king , If it please the king , and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight , that thou w@@ oul@@ dest send me unto Jud@@ ah , unto the city of my fathers ' se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res , that I may build it .
and the king said unto me , ( the queen also sitting by him , ) For how long shall thy journey be ? and when wil@@ t thou return ? so it pleased the king to send me ; and I set him a time .
moreover I said unto the king , If it please the king , let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river , that they may convey me over till I come into Jud@@ ah ;
then I came to the governors beyond the river , and gave them the king 's letters . now the king had sent cap@@ tains of the army and hor@@ sem@@ en with me .
when San@@ ball@@ at the Hor@@ on@@ ite , and Tob@@ i@@ ah the servant , the Am@@ mon@@ ite , heard of it , it griev@@ ed them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel .
then I went on to the gate of the fountain , and to the king 's pool : but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass .
and the rulers knew not whi@@ ther I went , or what I did ; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews , nor to the priests , nor to the no@@ bles , nor to the rulers , nor to the rest that did the work .
then said I unto them , Y@@ e see the distress that we are in , how Jerusalem li@@ eth waste , and the gates thereof are burned with fire : come , and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem , that we be no more a repro@@ ach .
but when San@@ ball@@ at the Hor@@ on@@ ite , and Tob@@ i@@ ah the servant , the Am@@ mon@@ ite , and G@@ es@@ hem the Arabian , heard it , they laughed us to scor@@ n , and desp@@ ised us , and said , What is this thing that ye do ? will ye rebel against the king ?
then answered I them , and said unto them , The God of heaven , he will prosper us ; therefore we his servants will arise and build : but ye have no portion , nor right , nor memorial , in Jerusalem .
then Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests , and they buil@@ ded the sheep gate ; they sancti@@ fied it , and set up the doors of it ; even unto the tower of Me@@ ah they sancti@@ fied it , unto the tower of Han@@ an@@ e@@ el .
and next unto him buil@@ ded the men of Jer@@ ich@@ o . and next to them buil@@ ded Z@@ acc@@ ur the son of Im@@ ri .
and next unto them repaired Mer@@ emo@@ th the son of Uri@@ jah , the son of Ko@@ z . and next unto them repaired M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lam the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of Mes@@ he@@ z@@ ab@@ e@@ el . and next unto them repaired Z@@ ad@@ ok the son of Ba@@ ana .
moreover the old gate repaired Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the son of Pas@@ e@@ ah , and M@@ esh@@ ul@@ lam the son of Bes@@ o@@ de@@ i@@ ah ; they laid the beams thereof , and set up the doors thereof , and the locks thereof , and the bars thereof .
next unto him repaired Uz@@ zi@@ el the son of Har@@ ha@@ i@@ ah , of the g@@ old@@ s@@ mi@@ ths . next unto him also repaired Han@@ ani@@ ah the son of one of the ap@@ oth@@ ec@@ aries , and they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall .
and next unto them repaired J@@ ed@@ aiah the son of Har@@ um@@ ap@@ h , even over against his house . and next unto him repaired H@@ att@@ ush the son of H@@ ash@@ ab@@ ni@@ ah .
and next unto him repaired Sh@@ all@@ um the son of H@@ alo@@ h@@ esh , the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem , he and his daughters .
the valley gate repaired H@@ anu@@ n , and the inhabitants of Z@@ ano@@ ah ; they built it , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof , and the bars thereof , and a thousand cub@@ its on the wall unto the d@@ ung gate .
but the d@@ ung gate repaired Mal@@ chi@@ ah the son of Rec@@ hab , the ruler of part of B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ h@@ acc@@ er@@ em ; he built it , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof , and the bars thereof .
after him repaired the Lev@@ ites , Re@@ h@@ um the son of B@@ ani . next unto him repaired H@@ ash@@ ab@@ i@@ ah , the ruler of the half part of Ke@@ il@@ ah , in his part .
after him repaired their brethren , Bav@@ ai the son of Hen@@ ad@@ ad , the ruler of the half part of Ke@@ il@@ ah .
and next to him repaired E@@ zer the son of Jes@@ hua , the ruler of M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h , another piece over against the going up to the arm@@ our@@ y at the turning of the wall .
after him Bar@@ uch the son of Zab@@ bai ear@@ ne@@ stly repaired the other piece , from the turning of the wall unto the door of the house of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the high priest .
after him repaired Mer@@ emo@@ th the son of Uri@@ jah the son of Ko@@ z another piece , from the door of the house of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b even to the end of the house of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b .
after him repaired Bin@@ nu@@ i the son of Hen@@ ad@@ ad another piece , from the house of Az@@ ari@@ ah unto the turning of the wall , even unto the corner .
Pal@@ al the son of Uz@@ ai , over against the turning of the wall , and the tower which li@@ eth out from the king 's high house , that was by the court of the prison . after him Ped@@ aiah the son of Par@@ osh .
moreover the Ne@@ thin@@ ims d@@ wel@@ t in O@@ ph@@ el , unto the place over against the water gate toward the east , and the tower that li@@ eth out .
now Tob@@ i@@ ah the Am@@ mon@@ ite was by him , and he said , Even that which they build , if a fox go up , he shall even break down their stone wall .
hear , O our God ; for we are desp@@ ised : and turn their repro@@ ach upon their own head , and give them for a prey in the land of cap@@ tivity :
and cover not their ini@@ qu@@ ity , and let not their sin be blo@@ tted out from before thee : for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders .
and our adversaries said , They shall not know , neither see , till we come in the midst among them , and sl@@ ay them , and cause the work to cease .
therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall , and on the higher places , I even set the people after their families with their s@@ words , their spe@@ ars , and their b@@ ows .
and it came to pass , when our enemies heard that it was known unto us , and God had brought their counsel to n@@ ought , that we returned all of us to the wall , every one unto his work .
for the builders , every one had his sword gir@@ ded by his side , and so buil@@ ded . and he that sounded the trum@@ pet was by me .
so neither I , nor my brethren , nor my servants , nor the men of the guard which followed me , none of us put off our clothes , saving that every one put them off for washing .
for there were that said , We , our sons , and our daughters , are many : therefore we take up corn for them , that we may eat , and live .
then I consulted with myself , and I rebu@@ ked the no@@ bles , and the rulers , and said unto them , Y@@ e exact us@@ ury , every one of his brother . and I set a great assembly against them .
also I said , It is not good that ye do : ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God because of the repro@@ ach of the he@@ a@@ then our enemies ?
I likewise , and my brethren , and my servants , might exact of them money and corn : I pray you , let us leave off this us@@ ury .
then said they , We will restore them , and will require nothing of them ; so will we do as thou say@@ est . then I called the priests , and took an oath of them , that they should do according to this promise .
but the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people , and had taken of them bread and wine , beside forty she@@ k@@ els of silver ; ye@@ a , even their servants bare rule over the people : but so did not I , because of the fear of God .
moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers , beside those that came unto us from among the he@@ a@@ then that are about us .
that San@@ ball@@ at and G@@ es@@ hem sent unto me , saying , Come , let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of O@@ no . but they thought to do me mis@@ chief .
and I sent messengers unto them , saying , I am doing a great work , so that I C@@ AN@@ NOT come down : why should the work cease , whilst I leave it , and come down to you ?
where@@ in was written , It is reported among the he@@ a@@ then , and G@@ ash@@ m@@ u sa@@ ith it , that thou and the Jews think to rebel : for which cause thou buil@@ dest the wall , that thou may@@ est be their king , according to these words .
and thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem , saying , There is a king in Jud@@ ah : and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words . come now therefore , and let us take counsel together .
for they all made us afraid , saying , Their hands shall be weakened from the work , that it be not done . now therefore , O God , strengthen my hands .
and I said , Should such a man as I flee ? and who is there , that , being as I am , would go into the temple to save his life ? I will not go in .
and , lo , I perceived that God had not sent him ; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me : for Tob@@ i@@ ah and San@@ ball@@ at had hired him .
therefore was he hired , that I should be afraid , and do so , and sin , and that they might have matter for an evil report , that they might repro@@ ach me .
my God , think thou upon Tob@@ i@@ ah and San@@ ball@@ at according to these their works , and on the proph@@ et@@ ess No@@ adi@@ ah , and the rest of the prophets , that would have put me in fear .
and it came to pass , that when all our enemies heard thereof , and all the he@@ a@@ then that were about us saw these things , they were much cast down in their own eyes : for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God .
now it came to pass , when the wall was built , and I had set up the doors , and the porters and the singers and the Lev@@ ites were appointed ,
that I gave my brother Han@@ ani , and Han@@ ani@@ ah the ruler of the palace , charge over Jerusalem : for he was a faithful man , and feared God above many .
who came with Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el , Jes@@ hua , Ne@@ h@@ emi@@ ah , Az@@ ari@@ ah , Ra@@ am@@ i@@ ah , N@@ ah@@ am@@ ani , Mor@@ dec@@ ai , Bil@@ shan , Mis@@ per@@ eth , B@@ ig@@ v@@ ai , Ne@@ h@@ um , Ba@@ an@@ ah . the number , I say , of the men of the people of Israel was this ;
the children of P@@ ah@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ Mo@@ ab , of the children of Jes@@ hua and Jo@@ ab , two thousand and eight hundred and eighteen .
the men of Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im , Ch@@ eph@@ ir@@ ah , and Be@@ ero@@ th , seven hundred forty and three .
and the Tir@@ sha@@ tha said unto them , that they should not eat of the most holy things , till there stood up a priest with Uri@@ m and T@@ hum@@ mi@@ m .
beside their man@@ servants and their mai@@ d@@ servants , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven : and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women .
and some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work . the Tir@@ sha@@ tha gave to the treasure a thousand dr@@ ams of gold , fifty bas@@ ons , five hundred and thirty priests ' garments .
and some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand dr@@ ams of gold , and two thousand and two hundred pound of silver .
and E@@ z@@ ra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women , and all that could hear with understanding , upon the first day of the seventh month .
and E@@ z@@ ra opened the book in the sight of all the people ; ( for he was above all the people ; ) and when he opened it , all the people stood up :
and E@@ z@@ ra blessed the LORD , the great God . and all the people answered , A@@ men , A@@ men , with lifting up their hands : and they bowed their heads , and wor@@ shipped the LORD with their faces to the ground .
so the Lev@@ ites sti@@ l@@ led all the people , saying , Hold your peace , for the day is holy ; neither be ye griev@@ ed .
and all the people went their way to eat , and to drink , and to send portions , and to make great mir@@ th , because they had understood the words that were declared unto them .
and they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses , that the children of Israel should dwell in boo@@ ths in the feast of the seventh month :
so the people went forth , and brought them , and made themselves boo@@ ths , every one upon the roof of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of the house of God , and in the street of the water gate , and in the street of the gate of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting , and with s@@ ack@@ clothes , and earth upon them .
then stood up upon the stairs , of the Lev@@ ites , Jes@@ hua , and B@@ ani , Kad@@ mi@@ el , She@@ ban@@ i@@ ah , Bun@@ ni , S@@ here@@ bi@@ ah , B@@ ani , and Chen@@ ani , and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God .
thou art the LORD the God , who did@@ st choose Ab@@ ram , and br@@ ough@@ test him forth out of U@@ r of the Chal@@ de@@ es , and g@@ av@@ est him the name of Abraham ;
and thou did@@ st divide the sea before them , so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land ; and their persec@@ utors thou thre@@ west into the de@@ eps , as a stone into the mighty waters .
moreover thou le@@ dd@@ est them in the day by a cloudy pillar ; and in the night by a pillar of fire , to give them light in the way where@@ in they should go .
and mad@@ est known unto them thy holy sab@@ bath , and comman@@ ded@@ st them prec@@ epts , statutes , and laws , by the hand of Moses thy servant :
moreover thou g@@ av@@ est them king@@ doms and nations , and did@@ st divide them into corners : so they possessed the land of Si@@ hon , and the land of the king of H@@ esh@@ bon , and the land of O@@ g king of Bash@@ an .
their children also multi@@ pli@@ ed@@ st thou as the stars of heaven , and br@@ ough@@ test them into the land , concerning which thou had@@ st promised to their fathers , that they should go in to possess it .
so the children went in and possessed the land , and thou subdu@@ ed@@ st before them the inhabitants of the land , the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ites , and g@@ av@@ est them into their hands , with their kings , and the people of the land , that they might do with them as they would .
nevertheless they were dis@@ obedient , and reb@@ elled against thee , and cast thy law behind their backs , and sle@@ w thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee , and they wrought great provocations .
yet many years did@@ st thou for@@ bear them , and testi@@ fi@@ ed@@ st against them by thy spirit in thy prophets : yet would they not give ear : therefore g@@ av@@ est thou them into the hand of the people of the lands .
How@@ be@@ it thou art just in all that is brought upon us ; for thou hast done right , but we have done w@@ ick@@ edly :
neither have our kings , our princes , our priests , nor our fathers , kept thy law , nor hear@@ k@@ ened unto thy commandments and thy testim@@ onies , where@@ with thou did@@ st testify against them .
behold , we are servants this day , and for the land that thou g@@ av@@ est unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof , behold , we are servants in it :
and it yiel@@ det@@ h much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins : also they have dom@@ inion over our bodies , and over our cattle , at their pleasure , and we are in great distress .
and that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land , nor take their daughters for our sons :
also we made ordin@@ ances for us , to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a she@@ kel for the service of the house of our God ;
and to bring the fir@@ st@@ fruits of our ground , and the fir@@ st@@ fruits of all fruit of all trees , year by year , unto the house of the LORD :
and the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Lev@@ ites , when the Lev@@ ites take ti@@ thes : and the Lev@@ ites shall bring up the ti@@ the of the ti@@ thes unto the house of our God , to the chambers , into the treasure house .
and the rulers of the people d@@ wel@@ t at Jerusalem : the rest of the people also cast lots , to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city , and nine parts to dwell in other cities .
now these are the chief of the province that d@@ wel@@ t in Jerusalem : but in the cities of Jud@@ ah d@@ wel@@ t every one in his possession in their cities , to w@@ it , Israel , the priests , and the Lev@@ ites , and the Ne@@ thin@@ ims , and the children of Solomon 's servants .
and their brethren that did the work of the house were eight hundred twenty and two : and Ad@@ aiah the son of J@@ ero@@ ham , the son of Pel@@ ali@@ ah , the son of Am@@ zi , the son of Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , the son of Pash@@ ur , the son of Mal@@ chi@@ ah ,
and his brethren , chief of the fathers , two hundred forty and two : and A@@ mas@@ hai the son of Az@@ are@@ el , the son of Ah@@ as@@ ai , the son of M@@ esh@@ ill@@ emo@@ th , the son of Im@@ mer ,
and their brethren , mighty men of val@@ our , an hundred twenty and eight : and their over@@ se@@ er was Zab@@ di@@ el , the son of one of the great men .
also of the Lev@@ ites : Sh@@ em@@ aiah the son of H@@ ash@@ u@@ b , the son of Az@@ ri@@ k@@ am , the son of H@@ ash@@ ab@@ i@@ ah , the son of Bun@@ ni ;
the over@@ se@@ er also of the Lev@@ ites at Jerusalem was Uz@@ zi the son of B@@ ani , the son of H@@ ash@@ ab@@ i@@ ah , the son of M@@ att@@ ani@@ ah , the son of Mic@@ ha . of the sons of As@@ ap@@ h , the singers were over the business of the house of God .
and for the villages , with their fields , some of the children of Jud@@ ah d@@ wel@@ t at Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ ar@@ ba , and in the villages thereof , and at Di@@ bon , and in the villages thereof , and at J@@ ek@@ ab@@ ze@@ el , and in the villages thereof ,
Z@@ ano@@ ah , Ad@@ ul@@ lam , and in their villages , at L@@ ach@@ ish , and the fields thereof , at A@@ ze@@ k@@ ah , and in the villages thereof . and they d@@ wel@@ t from Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba unto the valley of H@@ inno@@ m .
S@@ all@@ u , am@@ ok , Hil@@ ki@@ ah , J@@ ed@@ aiah . these were the chief of the priests and of their brethren in the days of Jes@@ hua .
and in the days of Jo@@ i@@ ak@@ im were priests , the chief of the fathers : of Ser@@ aiah , Mer@@ aiah ; of Jer@@ emi@@ ah , Han@@ ani@@ ah ;
the Lev@@ ites in the days of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b , Jo@@ i@@ ada , and Johan@@ an , and J@@ ad@@ du@@ a , were recorded chief of the fathers : also the priests , to the reign of D@@ arius the Persian .
also from the house of Gil@@ gal , and out of the fields of Ge@@ ba and Az@@ m@@ av@@ eth : for the singers had buil@@ ded them villages round about Jerusalem .
then I brought up the princes of Jud@@ ah upon the wall , and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks , where@@ of one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the d@@ ung gate :
and his brethren , Sh@@ em@@ aiah , and Az@@ ar@@ ael , Mil@@ al@@ ai , Gil@@ al@@ ai , Ma@@ ai , N@@ eth@@ an@@ e@@ el , and Jud@@ ah , Han@@ ani , with the musical instruments of David the man of God , and E@@ z@@ ra the scri@@ be before them .
also that day they offered great sacrifices , and rejo@@ iced : for God had made them rejoice with great joy : the wives also and the children rejo@@ iced : so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even af@@ ar off .
for in the days of David and As@@ ap@@ h of old there were chief of the singers , and songs of praise and thank@@ s@@ giving unto God .
on that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people ; and therein was found written , that the Am@@ mon@@ ite and the Mo@@ ab@@ ite should not come into the congregation of God for ever ;
because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water , but hired Bal@@ a@@ am against them , that he should curse them : How@@ be@@ it our God turned the curse into a blessing .
and before this , Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the priest , having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God , was allied unto Tob@@ i@@ ah :
but in all this time was not I at Jerusalem : for in the two and thir@@ ti@@ eth year of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ xes king of Babylon came I unto the king , and after certain days obtained I leave of the king :
and I came to Jerusalem , and understood of the evil that Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b did for Tob@@ i@@ ah , in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God .
and it griev@@ ed me sore : therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tob@@ i@@ ah out of the chamber .
then I commanded , and they cleans@@ ed the chambers : and thi@@ ther brought I again the vessels of the house of God , with the meat offering and the frank@@ inc@@ ense .
and I perceived that the portions of the Lev@@ ites had not been given them : for the Lev@@ ites and the singers , that did the work , were fled every one to his field .
then cont@@ ended I with the rulers , and said , Why is the house of God for@@ s@@ aken ? and I gathered them together , and set them in their place .
then brought all Jud@@ ah the ti@@ the of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treas@@ uries .
remember me , O my God , concerning this , and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God , and for the offices thereof .
then I cont@@ ended with the no@@ bles of Jud@@ ah , and said unto them , What evil thing is this that ye do , and prof@@ ane the sab@@ bath day ?
then I testified against them , and said unto them , Why lodge ye about the wall ? if ye do so again , I will lay hands on you . from that time forth came they no more on the sab@@ bath .
and I commanded the Lev@@ ites that they should clean@@ se themselves , and that they should come and keep the gates , to sancti@@ fy the sab@@ bath day . remember me , O my God , concerning this also , and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy .
and one of the sons of Jo@@ i@@ ada , the son of Eli@@ as@@ hi@@ b the high priest , was son in law to San@@ ball@@ at the Hor@@ on@@ ite : therefore I ch@@ ased him from me .
thus cleans@@ ed I them from all strangers , and appointed the wards of the priests and the Lev@@ ites , every one in his business ;
and for the wood offering , at times appointed , and for the fir@@ st@@ fruits . remember me , O my God , for good .
in the third year of his reign , he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants ; the power of Persia and Media , the no@@ bles and princes of the provinces , being before him :
when he sh@@ ew@@ ed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent maj@@ esty many days , even an hundred and four@@ score days .
and when these days were expired , the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Sh@@ ush@@ an the palace , both unto great and small , seven days , in the court of the garden of the king 's palace ;
and they gave them drink in vessels of gold , ( the vessels being diverse one from another , ) and royal wine in abundance , according to the state of the king .
also V@@ ash@@ ti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
on the seventh day , when the heart of the king was mer@@ ry with wine , he commanded Me@@ human , Biz@@ tha , Har@@ bon@@ a , B@@ ig@@ tha , and Ab@@ ag@@ tha , Z@@ eth@@ ar , and Car@@ c@@ as , the seven Cham@@ ber@@ l@@ ains that served in the presence of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us the king ,
and Mem@@ uc@@ an answered before the king and the princes , V@@ ash@@ ti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only , but also to all the princes , and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women , so that they shall desp@@ ise their husbands in their eyes , when it shall be reported , The king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us commanded V@@ ash@@ ti the queen to be brought in before him , but she came not .
likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king 's princes , which have heard of the deed of the queen . thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath .
and when the king 's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire , ( for it is great , ) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour , both to great and small .
now in Sh@@ ush@@ an the palace there was a certain Jew , whose name was Mor@@ dec@@ ai , the son of J@@ air , the son of Shim@@ ei , the son of K@@ ish , a Ben@@ jam@@ ite ;
who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the cap@@ tivity which had been carried away with J@@ econ@@ i@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king of Babylon had carried away .
then thus came every mai@@ den unto the king ; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king 's house .
and the king loved Es@@ ther above all the women , and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the vir@@ gins ; so that he set the royal crown upon her head , and made her queen instead of V@@ ash@@ ti .
then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants , even Es@@ ther 's feast ; and he made a release to the provinces , and gave gifts , according to the state of the king .
in those days , while Mor@@ dec@@ ai sat in the king 's gate , two of the king 's Cham@@ ber@@ l@@ ains , B@@ ig@@ than and Ter@@ esh , of those which kept the door , were w@@ ro@@ th , and sought to lay hand on the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
and when inqui@@ sition was made of the matter , it was found out ; therefore they were both han@@ ged on a tree : and it was written in the book of the chron@@ icles before the king .
and all the king 's servants , that were in the king 's gate , bowed , and rever@@ enced Ham@@ an : for the king had so commanded concerning him . but Mor@@ dec@@ ai bowed not , nor did him reverence .
then the king 's servants , which were in the king 's gate , said unto Mor@@ dec@@ ai , Why trans@@ gres@@ s@@ est thou the king 's commandment ?
and the king said unto Ham@@ an , The silver is given to thee , the people also , to do with them as it seem@@ eth good to thee .
the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people , that they should be ready against that day .
the posts went out , being ha@@ st@@ ened by the king 's commandment , and the decree was given in Sh@@ ush@@ an the palace . and the king and Ham@@ an sat down to drink ; but the city Sh@@ ush@@ an was perpl@@ exed .
when Mor@@ dec@@ ai perceived all that was done , Mor@@ dec@@ ai rent his clothes , and put on s@@ ack@@ cloth with ashes , and went out into the midst of the city , and cried with a loud and a bitter cry ;
so Es@@ ther 's m@@ aids and her Cham@@ ber@@ l@@ ains came and told it her . then was the queen exceedingly griev@@ ed ; and she sent ra@@ iment to clo@@ the Mor@@ dec@@ ai , and to take away his s@@ ack@@ cloth from him : but he received it not .
then called Es@@ ther for Hat@@ ach , one of the king 's Cham@@ ber@@ l@@ ains , whom he had appointed to attend upon her , and gave him a commandment to Mor@@ dec@@ ai , to know what it was , and why it was .
so Hat@@ ach went forth to Mor@@ dec@@ ai unto the street of the city , which was before the king 's gate .
and Mor@@ dec@@ ai told him of all that had happened unto him , and of the sum of the money that Ham@@ an had promised to pay to the king 's treas@@ uries for the Jews , to destroy them .
then Mor@@ dec@@ ai commanded to answer Es@@ ther , Th@@ ink not with thy@@ self that thou shalt escape in the king 's house , more than all the Jews .
then said the king unto her , What wil@@ t thou , queen Es@@ ther ? and what is thy request ? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom .
and Es@@ ther answered , If it seem good unto the king , let the king and Ham@@ an come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him .
then the king said , C@@ ause Ham@@ an to make ha@@ ste , that he may do as Es@@ ther hath said . so the king and Ham@@ an came to the banquet that Es@@ ther had prepared .
and the king said unto Es@@ ther at the banquet of wine , What is thy petition ? and it shall be granted thee : and what is thy request ? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed .
if I have found favour in the sight of the king , and if it please the king to grant my petition , and to perform my request , let the king and Ham@@ an come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them , and I will do tomorrow as the king hath said .
then went Ham@@ an forth that day joyful and with a glad heart : but when Ham@@ an saw Mor@@ dec@@ ai in the king 's gate , that he stood not up , nor moved for him , he was full of indignation against Mor@@ dec@@ ai .
and Ham@@ an told them of the glory of his riches , and the multitude of his children , and all the things where@@ in the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
Ham@@ an said moreover , Y@@ ea , Es@@ ther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself ; and to mor@@ row am I invited unto her also with the king .
on that night could not the king sleep , and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chron@@ icles ; and they were read before the king .
and it was found written , that Mor@@ dec@@ ai had told of B@@ ig@@ th@@ ana and Ter@@ esh , two of the king 's Cham@@ ber@@ l@@ ains , the keepers of the door , who sought to lay hand on the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us .
and the king said , What honour and dignity hath been done to Mor@@ dec@@ ai for this ? then said the king 's servants that minist@@ ered unto him , There is nothing done for him .
and the king said , Who is in the court ? now Ham@@ an was come into the outward court of the king 's house , to speak unto the king to hang Mor@@ dec@@ ai on the g@@ allows that he had prepared for him .
and the king 's servants said unto him , Be@@ hold , Ham@@ an stand@@ eth in the court . and the king said , Let him come in .
so Ham@@ an came in . and the king said unto him , What shall be done unto the man whom the king deli@@ ght@@ eth to honour ? now Ham@@ an thought in his heart , To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself ?
let the royal app@@ arel be brought which the king us@@ eth to wear , and the horse that the king ri@@ det@@ h upon , and the crown royal which is set upon his head :
then the king said to Ham@@ an , Make ha@@ ste , and take the app@@ arel and the horse , as thou hast said , and do even so to Mor@@ dec@@ ai the Jew , that sit@@ t@@ eth at the king 's gate : let nothing fail of all that thou has spoken .
then took Ham@@ an the app@@ arel and the horse , and ar@@ ra@@ yed Mor@@ dec@@ ai , and brought him on horse@@ back through the street of the city , and proclaimed before him , Th@@ us shall it be done unto the man whom the king deli@@ ght@@ eth to honour .
and while they were yet talking with him , came the king 's Cham@@ ber@@ l@@ ains , and ha@@ sted to bring Ham@@ an unto the banquet that Es@@ ther had prepared .
and the king said again unto Es@@ ther on the second day at the banquet of wine , What is thy petition , queen Es@@ ther ? and it shall be granted thee : and what is thy request ? and it shall be performed , even to the half of the kingdom .
for we are sold , I and my people , to be destroyed , to be sl@@ ain , and to perish . but if we had been sold for bond@@ men and bond@@ women , I had held my tongue , although the enemy could not counter@@ v@@ ail the king 's damage .
then the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us answered and said unto Es@@ ther the queen , Who is he , and where is he , that Dur@@ st presume in his heart to do so ?
and the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden : and Ham@@ an stood up to make request for his life to Es@@ ther the queen ; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king .
and Har@@ bon@@ ah , one of the Cham@@ ber@@ l@@ ains , said before the king , Be@@ hold also , the g@@ allows fifty cub@@ its high , which Ham@@ an had made for Mor@@ dec@@ ai , who had spoken good for the king , stand@@ eth in the house of Ham@@ an . then the king said , H@@ ang him there@@ on .
on that day did the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us give the house of Ham@@ an the Jews ' enemy unto Es@@ ther the queen . and Mor@@ dec@@ ai came before the king ; for Es@@ ther had told what he was unto her .
and Es@@ ther sp@@ ake yet again before the king , and fell down at his feet , and bes@@ ought him with tears to put away the mis@@ chief of Ham@@ an the Ag@@ ag@@ ite , and his device that he had devised against the Jews .
for how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people ? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kind@@ red ?
then the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us said unto Es@@ ther the queen and to Mor@@ dec@@ ai the Jew , Be@@ hold , I have given Es@@ ther the house of Ham@@ an , and him they have han@@ ged upon the g@@ allows , because he laid his hand upon the Jews .
and he wrote in the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us ' name , and sealed it with the king 's ring , and sent letters by posts on horse@@ back , and riders on mul@@ es , cam@@ els , and young dro@@ med@@ aries :
upon one day in all the provinces of king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , namely , upon the thir@@ teenth day of the twel@@ fth month , which is the month Ad@@ ar .
the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people , and that the Jews should be ready against that day to av@@ enge themselves on their enemies .
and Mor@@ dec@@ ai went out from the presence of the king in royal app@@ arel of blue and white , and with a great crown of gold , and with a garment of fine linen and purple : and the city of Sh@@ ush@@ an rejo@@ iced and was glad .
the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , to lay hand on such as sought their hurt : and no man could withstand them ; for the fear of them fell upon all people .
and all the rulers of the provinces , and the li@@ eut@@ en@@ ants , and the deputies , and officers of the king , helped the Jews ; because the fear of Mor@@ dec@@ ai fell upon them .
thus the Jews smo@@ te all their enemies with the stroke of the sword , and slaughter , and destruction , and did what they would unto those that hated them .
the ten sons of Ham@@ an the son of Ham@@ med@@ atha , the enemy of the Jews , sle@@ w they ; but on the spoil laid they not their hand .
and the king commanded it so to be done : and the decree was given at Sh@@ ush@@ an ; and they han@@ ged Ham@@ an 's ten sons .
for the Jews that were in Sh@@ ush@@ an gathered themselves together on the four@@ teenth day also of the month Ad@@ ar , and sle@@ w three hundred men at Sh@@ ush@@ an ; but on the prey they laid not their hand .
on the thir@@ teenth day of the month Ad@@ ar ; and on the four@@ teenth day of the same rested they , and made it a day of fe@@ asting and gl@@ ad@@ ness .
but the Jews that were at Sh@@ ush@@ an assembled together on the thir@@ teenth day thereof ; and on the four@@ teenth thereof ; and on the fif@@ teenth day of the same they rested , and made it a day of fe@@ asting and gl@@ ad@@ ness .
therefore the Jews of the villages , that d@@ wel@@ t in the un@@ w@@ alled towns , made the four@@ teenth day of the month Ad@@ ar a day of gl@@ ad@@ ness and fe@@ asting , and a good day , and of sending portions one to another .
to st@@ ablis@@ h this among them , that they should keep the four@@ teenth day of the month Ad@@ ar , and the fif@@ teenth day of the same , yearly ,
W@@ herefore they called these days Pur@@ im after the name of P@@ ur . therefore for all the words of this letter , and of that which they had seen concerning this matter , and which had come unto them ,
to confirm these days of Pur@@ im in their times appointed , according as Mor@@ dec@@ ai the Jew and Es@@ ther the queen had enjo@@ ined them , and as they had decre@@ ed for themselves and for their seed , the matters of the fast@@ ings and their cry .
and all the acts of his power and of his might , and the declaration of the greatness of Mor@@ dec@@ ai , where@@ unto the king advanced him , are they not written in the book of the chron@@ icles of the kings of Media and Persia ?
there was a man in the land of U@@ z , whose name was Job ; and that man was perfect and upright , and one that feared God , and es@@ chew@@ ed evil .
his substance also was seven thousand sheep , and three thousand cam@@ els , and five hundred y@@ oke of ox@@ en , and five hundred she asses , and a very great household ; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east .
now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD , and Satan came also among them .
hast not thou made an hedge about him , and about his house , and about all that he hath on every side ? thou hast blessed the work of his hands , and his substance is increased in the land .
but put forth th@@ ine hand now , and touch all that he hath , and he will curse thee to thy face .
and the LORD said unto Satan , Be@@ hold , all that he hath is in thy power ; only upon himself put not forth th@@ ine hand . so Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD .
while he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , The fire of God is fallen from heaven , and hath burned up the sheep , and the servants , and consumed them ; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee .
while he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , The Chal@@ de@@ ans made out three bands , and fell upon the cam@@ els , and have carried them away , ye@@ a , and sl@@ ain the servants with the edge of the sword ; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee .
while he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , Th@@ y sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their el@@ dest brother 's house :
and , behold , there came a great wind from the wilderness , and smo@@ te the four corners of the house , and it fell upon the young men , and they are dead ; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee .
then Job arose , and rent his mantle , and sha@@ ved his head , and fell down upon the ground , and wor@@ shipped ,
and said , N@@ aked came I out of my mother 's womb , and naked shall I return thi@@ ther : the LORD gave , and the LORD hath taken away ; blessed be the name of the LORD .
but put forth th@@ ine hand now , and touch his bone and his flesh , and he will curse thee to thy face .
so went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD , and smo@@ te Job with sore bo@@ ils from the sole of his foot unto his crown .
but he said unto her , Th@@ ou spe@@ ak@@ est as one of the foolish women spe@@ ak@@ eth . what ? shall we receive good at the hand of God , and shall we not receive evil ? in all this did not Job sin with his lips .
and when they lifted up their eyes af@@ ar off , and knew him not , they lifted up their voice , and we@@ pt ; and they rent every one his mantle , and sprink@@ led dust upon their heads toward heaven .
let the day perish where@@ in I was born , and the night in which it was said , There is a man child conceived .
let darkness and the shadow of death st@@ ain it ; let a cloud dwell upon it ; let the black@@ ness of the day terri@@ fy it .
as for that night , let darkness seize upon it ; let it not be joined unto the days of the year , let it not come into the number of the months .
remember , I pray thee , who ever perished , being innocent ? or where were the righteous cut off ?
how much less in them that dwell in houses of clay , whose foundation is in the dust , which are crushed before the moth ?
his children are far from safety , and they are crushed in the gate , neither is there any to deliver them .
whose harvest the hungry e@@ at@@ eth up , and tak@@ eth it even out of the thor@@ ns , and the rob@@ ber sw@@ allow@@ eth up their substance .
he tak@@ eth the wise in their own craft@@ iness : and the counsel of the fro@@ ward is carried head@@ long .
but he sav@@ eth the poor from the sword , from their mouth , and from the hand of the mighty .
behold , happy is the man whom God correc@@ t@@ eth : therefore desp@@ ise not thou the cha@@ st@@ ening of the Almighty :
even that it would please God to destroy me ; that he would let loose his hand , and cut me off !
then should I yet have comfort ; ye@@ a , I would har@@ den myself in sorrow : let him not spare ; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One .
my brethren have dealt dece@@ it@@ fully as a bro@@ ok , and as the stream of bro@@ o@@ ks they pass away ;
what time they wax warm , they v@@ anish : when it is hot , they are consumed out of their place .
when I lie down , I say , When shall I arise , and the night be gone ? and I am full of tos@@ s@@ ings to and fro unto the d@@ aw@@ ning of the day .
my flesh is clo@@ thed with worms and clo@@ ds of dust ; my skin is broken , and become lo@@ ath@@ some .
therefore I will not refrain my mouth ; I will speak in the angu@@ ish of my spirit ; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul .
I have sin@@ ned ; what shall I do unto thee , O thou preserv@@ er of men ? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee , so that I am a burden to myself ?
and why d@@ ost thou not pardon my trans@@ g@@ ression , and take away mine ini@@ qu@@ ity ? for now shall I sleep in the dust ; and thou shalt seek me in the morning , but I shall not be .
he is wise in heart , and mighty in strength : who hath hardened himself against him , and hath prosper@@ ed ?
behold , he tak@@ eth away , who can hinder him ? who will say unto him , What do@@ est thou ?
if I justify myself , mine own mouth shall condemn me : if I say , I am perfect , it shall also prove me perverse .
the earth is given into the hand of the wicked : he cover@@ eth the faces of the judges thereof ; if not , where , and who is he ?
now my days are swif@@ ter than a post : they flee away , they see no good .
they are passed away as the swift ships : as the eagle that ha@@ st@@ eth to the prey .
if I say , I will forget my complaint , I will leave off my heav@@ iness , and comfort myself :
is it good unto thee that thou shoul@@ dest op@@ press , that thou shoul@@ dest desp@@ ise the work of th@@ ine hands , and shine upon the counsel of the wicked ?
remember , I bes@@ e@@ ech thee , that thou hast made me as the clay ; and wil@@ t thou bring me into dust again ?
thou hast clo@@ thed me with skin and flesh , and hast f@@ enced me with bones and sin@@ ews .
if I be wicked , w@@ oe unto me ; and if I be righteous , yet will I not lift up my head . I am full of confusion ; therefore see thou mine afflic@@ tion ;
W@@ herefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb ? Oh that I had given up the ghost , and no eye had seen me !
a land of darkness , as darkness itself ; and of the shadow of death , without any order , and where the light is as darkness .
for vain man would be wise , though man be born like a wild ass 's col@@ t .
also thou shalt lie down , and none shall make thee afraid ; ye@@ a , many shall make suit unto thee .
but ask now the beasts , and they shall teach thee ; and the f@@ ow@@ ls of the air , and they shall tell thee :
he discover@@ eth deep things out of darkness , and br@@ ing@@ eth out to light the shadow of death .
they gro@@ pe in the dark without light , and he mak@@ eth them to stag@@ ger like a drun@@ ken man .
hold your peace , let me alone , that I may speak , and let come on me what will .
for thou writ@@ est bitter things against me , and mak@@ est me to possess the ini@@ qu@@ ities of my youth .
thou put@@ test my feet also in the stocks , and look@@ est narrowly unto all my paths ; thou sett@@ est a print upon the heels of my feet .
he com@@ eth forth like a flower , and is cut down : he fle@@ eth also as a shadow , and continu@@ eth not .
for there is hope of a tree , if it be cut down , that it will spr@@ out again , and that the tender branch thereof will not cease .
O that thou w@@ oul@@ dest hide me in the grave , that thou w@@ oul@@ dest keep me secret , until thy wrath be past , that thou w@@ oul@@ dest appoint me a set time , and remember me !
the wicked man tr@@ avail@@ eth with pain all his days , and the number of years is hidden to the op@@ pres@@ sor .
trouble and angu@@ ish shall make him afraid ; they shall prevail against him , as a king ready to the battle .
and thou hast filled me with wrinkles , which is a witness against me : and my lean@@ ness rising up in me be@@ areth witness to my face .
he te@@ areth me in his wrath , who hat@@ eth me : he gn@@ ash@@ eth upon me with his teeth ; mine enemy sharpen@@ eth his eyes upon me .
his arch@@ ers compass me round about , he cle@@ av@@ eth my re@@ ins as@@ under , and do@@ th not spare ; he p@@ ou@@ re@@ th out my g@@ all upon the ground .
when a few years are come , then I shall go the way wh@@ ence I shall not return .
lay down now , put me in a su@@ rety with thee ; who is he that will strike hands with me ?
I have said to corruption , Th@@ ou art my father : to the worm , Th@@ ou are my mother , and my sister .
how long will it be ere ye make an end of words ? mark , and afterwards we will speak .
the light shall be dark in his tab@@ ern@@ acle , and his candle shall be put out with him .
for he is cast into a net by his own feet , and he wal@@ ket@@ h upon a sn@@ are .
surely such are the dwell@@ ings of the wicked , and this is the place of him that know@@ eth not God .
these ten times have ye repro@@ ached me : ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me .
they that dwell in mine house , and my m@@ aids , count me for a stranger : I am an alien in their sight .
have pity upon me , have pity upon me , O ye my friends ; for the hand of God hath touched me .
know@@ est thou not this of old , since man was placed upon earth ,
his bones are full of the sin of his youth , which shall lie down with him in the dust .
surely he shall not feel qui@@ et@@ ness in his belly , he shall not save of that which he desired .
when he is about to fill his belly , God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him , and shall rain it upon him while he is eating .
all darkness shall be hid in his secret places : a fire not blown shall consume him ; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tab@@ ern@@ acle .
for what pleasure hath he in his house after him , when the number of his months is cut off in the midst ?
for ye say , Where is the house of the prince ? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked ?
that the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction ? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath .
the clo@@ ds of the valley shall be sweet unto him , and every man shall draw after him , as there are innumerable before him .
can a man be profitable unto God , as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself ?
is not God in the height of heaven ? and behold the height of the stars , how high they are !
yet he filled their houses with good things : but the counsel of the wicked is far from me .
thou shalt make thy prayer unto him , and he shall hear thee , and thou shalt pay thy v@@ ows .
thou shalt also decree a thing , and it shall be established unto thee : and the light shall shine upon thy ways .
on the left hand , where he do@@ th work , but I C@@ AN@@ NOT behold him : he hi@@ det@@ h himself on the right hand , that I C@@ AN@@ NOT see him :
but he know@@ eth the way that I take : when he hath tried me , I shall come forth as gold .
why , seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty , do they that know him not see his days ?
they are wet with the showers of the mountains , and embrace the rock for want of a shelter .
they are of those that rebel against the light ; they know not the ways thereof , nor abide in the paths thereof .
the murderer rising with the light kill@@ eth the poor and ne@@ edy , and in the night is as a thief .
in the dark they dig through houses , which they had marked for themselves in the daytime : they know not the light .
they are exalted for a little while , but are gone and brought low ; they are taken out of the way as all other , and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn .
how then can man be justified with God ? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman ?
he hath comp@@ assed the waters with bounds , until the day and night come to an end .
lo , these are parts of his ways : but how little a portion is heard of him ? but the thunder of his power who can understand ?
as God liv@@ eth , who hath taken away my judgment ; and the Almighty , who hath v@@ exed my soul ;
for what is the hope of the hypo@@ cr@@ ite , though he hath gained , when God tak@@ eth away his soul ?
if his children be multiplied , it is for the sword : and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread .
the rich man shall lie down , but he shall not be gathered : he open@@ eth his eyes , and he is not .
the flood break@@ eth out from the inhabit@@ ant ; even the waters forgotten of the foot : they are dried up , they are gone away from men .
it C@@ AN@@ NOT be valued with the gold of O@@ ph@@ ir , with the precious ony@@ x , or the s@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire .
no mention shall be made of coral , or of pear@@ ls : for the price of wisdom is above rub@@ ies .
then did he see it , and declare it ; he prepared it , ye@@ a , and searched it out .
and unto man he said , Be@@ hold , the fear of the Lord , that is wisdom ; and to depart from evil is understanding .
the young men saw me , and hid themselves : and the aged arose , and stood up .
my root was spread out by the waters , and the de@@ w lay all night upon my branch .
and they waited for me as for the rain ; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain .
I chose out their way , and sat chief , and d@@ wel@@ t as a king in the army , as one that comfor@@ t@@ eth the mour@@ ners .
but now they that are younger than I have me in deri@@ sion , whose fathers I would have disd@@ ained to have set with the dogs of my flock .
upon my right hand rise the youth ; they push away my feet , and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction .
my har@@ p also is turned to mourning , and my organ into the voice of them that we@@ ep .
if mine heart have been deceived by a woman , or if I have laid wait at my neighbour 's door ;
( for from my youth he was brought up with me , as with a father , and I have guided her from my mother 's womb ; )
if I rejo@@ iced at the destruction of him that hated me , or lifted up myself when evil found him :
then was kind@@ led the wrath of Eli@@ hu the son of Bar@@ ach@@ el the Bu@@ z@@ ite , of the kind@@ red of R@@ am : against Job was his wrath kind@@ led , because he justified himself rather than God .
for I know not to give fl@@ attering titles ; in so doing my maker would soon take me away .
behold , I am according to thy wish in God 's stead : I also am formed out of the clay .
behold , in this thou art not just : I will answer thee , that God is greater than man .
he shall pray unto God , and he will be favourable unto him : and he shall see his face with joy : for he will render unto man his righteousness .
he loo@@ ket@@ h upon men , and if any say , I have sin@@ ned , and perver@@ ted that which was right , and it prof@@ ited me not ;
he will deliver his soul from going into the pit , and his life shall see the light .
when he gi@@ v@@ eth qui@@ et@@ ness , who then can make trouble ? and when he hi@@ det@@ h his face , who then can behold him ? whether it be done against a nation , or against a man only :
should it be according to thy mind ? he will re@@ comp@@ ense it , whether thou refuse , or whether thou choose ; and not I : therefore speak what thou know@@ est .
but now , because it is not so , he hath visited in his anger ; yet he know@@ eth it not in great extrem@@ ity :
but if they obey not , they shall perish by the sword , and they shall die without knowledge .
but thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked : judgment and justice take hold on thee .
for he sa@@ ith to the snow , Be thou on the earth ; likewise to the small rain , and to the great rain of his strength .
and it is turned round about by his coun@@ sels : that they may do whatsoever he comman@@ det@@ h them upon the face of the world in the earth .
hear@@ ken unto this , O Job : stand still , and consider the won@@ dr@@ ous works of God .
touching the Almighty , we C@@ AN@@ NOT find him out : he is excellent in power , and in judgment , and in plenty of justice : he will not aff@@ l@@ ict .
have the gates of death been opened unto thee ? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death ?
that thou shoul@@ dest take it to the bound thereof , and that thou shoul@@ dest know the paths to the house thereof ?
the waters are hid as with a stone , and the face of the deep is frozen .
who hath put wisdom in the inward parts ? or who hath given understanding to the heart ?
who provi@@ det@@ h for the ra@@ ven his food ? when his young ones cry unto God , they wander for lack of meat .
know@@ est thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth ? or can@@ st thou mark when the hin@@ ds do cal@@ ve ?
their young ones are in good liking , they grow up with corn ; they go forth , and return not unto them .
he sw@@ allow@@ eth the ground with fierc@@ eness and rage : neither believ@@ eth he that it is the sound of the trum@@ pet .
he sa@@ ith among the trum@@ pets , H@@ a , ha ; and he sm@@ ell@@ eth the battle af@@ ar off , the thunder of the cap@@ tains , and the shouting .
she dwell@@ eth and ab@@ id@@ eth on the rock , upon the cra@@ g of the rock , and the strong place .
hast thou an arm like God ? or can@@ st thou thunder with a voice like him ?
behold now beh@@ emo@@ th , which I made with thee ; he e@@ at@@ eth grass as an ox .
he tak@@ eth it with his eyes : his nose pierc@@ eth through sn@@ ares .
lay th@@ ine hand upon him , remember the battle , do no more .
behold , the hope of him is in vain : shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him ?
the arrow C@@ AN@@ NOT make him flee : sl@@ ing@@ stones are turned with him into stub@@ ble .
so the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning : for he had fourteen thousand sheep , and six thousand cam@@ els , and a thousand y@@ oke of ox@@ en , and a thousand she asses .
after this lived Job an hundred and forty years , and saw his sons , and his sons ' sons , even four generations .
blessed is the man that wal@@ ket@@ h not in the counsel of the un@@ go@@ dly , nor stand@@ eth in the way of sinners , nor sit@@ t@@ eth in the seat of the scor@@ n@@ ful .
kiss the Son , lest he be angry , and ye perish from the way , when his wrath is kind@@ led but a little . blessed are all they that put their trust in him .
O ye sons of men , how long will ye turn my glory into shame ? how long will ye love van@@ ity , and seek after leasing ? Sel@@ ah .
my voice shalt thou hear in the morning , O LORD ; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee , and will look up .
but let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice : let them ever shout for joy , because thou def@@ end@@ est them : let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee .
I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness : and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high .
the LORD is known by the judgment which he execut@@ eth : the wicked is sn@@ ared in the work of his own hands . H@@ ig@@ g@@ ai@@ on . Sel@@ ah .
he sit@@ t@@ eth in the lur@@ king places of the villages : in the secret places do@@ th he murder the innocent : his eyes are priv@@ ily set against the poor .
in the LORD put I my trust : how say ye to my soul , Fle@@ e as a bird to your mountain ?
for the oppression of the poor , for the sigh@@ ing of the ne@@ edy , now will I arise , sa@@ ith the LORD ; I will set him in safety from him that pu@@ ff@@ eth at him .
how long wil@@ t thou forget me , O LORD ? for ever ? how long wil@@ t thou hide thy face from me ?
Lord , who shall abide in thy tab@@ ern@@ acle ? who shall dwell in thy holy hill ?
sh@@ ew thy marv@@ ell@@ ous lov@@ ing@@ kindness , O thou that sav@@ est by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them .
then the channels of waters were seen , and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebu@@ ke , O LORD , at the blast of the breath of thy no@@ str@@ ils .
thou hast delivered me from the stri@@ vings of the people ; and thou hast made me the head of the he@@ a@@ then : a people whom I have not known shall serve me .
their line is gone out through all the earth , and their words to the end of the world . in them hath he set a tab@@ ern@@ acle for the sun ,
the law of the LORD is perfect , converting the soul : the testimony of the LORD is sure , making wise the simple .
keep back thy servant also from presu@@ mp@@ tuous sins ; let them not have dom@@ inion over me : then shall I be upright , and I shall be innocent from the great trans@@ g@@ ression .
save , LORD : let the king hear us when we call .
therefore shalt thou make them turn their back , when thou shalt make ready th@@ ine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them .
all they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship : all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him : and none can keep alive his own soul .
to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee , and not be silent . O LORD my God , I will give thanks unto thee for ever .
for I have heard the slan@@ der of many : fear was on every side : while they took counsel together against me , they devised to take away my life .
Oh how great is thy goodness , which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee ; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men !
thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man : thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues .
for this shall every one that is go@@ dly pray unto thee in a time when thou may@@ est be found : surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come ni@@ gh unto him .
be ye not as the horse , or as the mu@@ le , which have no understanding : whose mouth must be held in with bit and bri@@ dle , lest they come near unto thee .
many sor@@ rows shall be to the wicked : but he that trust@@ eth in the LORD , mercy shall compass him about .
be glad in the LORD , and rejoice , ye righteous : and shout for joy , all ye that are upright in heart .
let them be conf@@ ounded and put to shame that seek after my soul : let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt .
let destruction come upon him at un@@ awa@@ res ; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself : into that very destruction let him fall .
all my bones shall say , LORD , who is like unto thee , which deliver@@ est the poor from him that is too strong for him , ye@@ a , the poor and the ne@@ edy from him that spo@@ il@@ eth him ?
but in mine ad@@ versity they rejo@@ iced , and gathered themselves together : ye@@ a , the ab@@ jects gathered themselves together against me , and I knew it not ; they did tear me , and ceased not :
let them shout for joy , and be glad , that favour my righteous cause : ye@@ a , let them say continually , Let the LORD be magni@@ fied , which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant .
for yet a little while , and the wicked shall not be : ye@@ a , thou shalt dilig@@ ently consider his place , and it shall not be .
the wicked have drawn out the sword , and have bent their bow , to cast down the poor and ne@@ edy , and to sl@@ ay such as be of upright conversation .
but the wicked shall perish , and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lam@@ bs : they shall consume ; into smoke shall they consume away .
for such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth ; and they that be cur@@ sed of him shall be cut off .
he is ever mer@@ ciful , and len@@ det@@ h ; and his seed is blessed .
the LORD will not leave him in his hand , nor condemn him when he is judged .
for innumerable evils have comp@@ assed me about : mine ini@@ qu@@ ities have taken hold upon me , so that I am not able to look up ; they are more than the ha@@ irs of mine head : therefore my heart fail@@ eth me .
O my God , my soul is cast down within me : therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan , and of the Her@@ mon@@ ites , from the hill M@@ iz@@ ar .
yet the LORD will command his lov@@ ing@@ kindness in the daytime , and in the night his song shall be with me , and my prayer unto the God of my life .
why art thou cast down , O my soul ? and why art thou dis@@ qui@@ eted within me ? hope thou in God : for I shall yet praise him , who is the health of my coun@@ tenance , and my God .
why art thou cast down , O my soul ? and why art thou dis@@ qui@@ eted within me ? hope in God : for I shall yet praise him , who is the health of my coun@@ tenance , and my God .
how thou did@@ st drive out the he@@ a@@ then with thy hand , and plan@@ t@@ ed@@ st them ; how thou did@@ st aff@@ l@@ ict the people , and cast them out .
for they got not the land in possession by their own sword , neither did their own arm save them : but thy right hand , and th@@ ine arm , and the light of thy coun@@ tenance , because thou had@@ st a favour unto them .
and in thy maj@@ esty ride prosper@@ ously because of truth and me@@ ek@@ ness and righteousness ; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things .
the princes of the people are gathered together , even the people of the God of Abraham : for the shi@@ elds of the earth belong unto God : he is greatly exalted .
beautiful for situation , the joy of the whole earth , is mount Z@@ ion , on the sides of the north , the city of the great King .
wh@@ os@@ o off@@ er@@ eth praise glori@@ fi@@ eth me : and to him that or@@ der@@ eth his conversation ari@@ ght will I sh@@ ew the salvation of God .
God shall likewise destroy thee for ever , he shall take thee away , and pl@@ uck thee out of thy dwelling place , and root thee out of the land of the living . Sel@@ ah .
every one of them is gone back : they are altogether become fil@@ thy ; there is none that do@@ eth good , no , not one .
there were they in great fear , where no fear was : for God hath scattered the bones of him that enc@@ amp@@ eth against thee : thou hast put them to shame , because God hath desp@@ ised them .
Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Z@@ ion ! when God br@@ ing@@ eth back the cap@@ tivity of his people , Jacob shall rejoice , and Israel shall be glad .
for it was not an enemy that repro@@ ached me ; then I could have borne it : neither was it he that hated me that did magni@@ fy himself against me ; then I would have hid myself from him :
but it was thou , a man mine equal , my guide , and mine acquaintance .
thou tell@@ est my wan@@ der@@ ings : put thou my tears into thy bottle : are they not in thy book ?
they have prepared a net for my steps ; my soul is bowed down : they have di@@ gged a pit before me , into the midst where@@ of they are fallen themselves . Sel@@ ah .
let them melt away as waters which run continually : when he ben@@ det@@ h his bow to shoot his arrows , let them be as cut in pieces .
as a sn@@ ail which mel@@ t@@ eth , let every one of them pass away : like the un@@ timely birth of a woman , that they may not see the sun .
but I will sing of thy power ; ye@@ a , I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning : for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble .
thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee , that it may be displayed because of the truth . Sel@@ ah .
they search out ini@@ qu@@ ities ; they accomplish a dilig@@ ent search : both the inward thought of every one of them , and the heart , is deep .
blessed is the man whom thou choos@@ est , and caus@@ est to approach unto thee , that he may dwell in thy courts : we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house , even of thy holy temple .
by terrible things in righteousness wil@@ t thou answer us , O God of our salvation ; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth , and of them that are af@@ ar off upon the sea :
thou vis@@ it@@ est the earth , and water@@ est it : thou greatly en@@ richest it with the river of God , which is full of water : thou prepa@@ rest them corn , when thou hast so provided for it .
the past@@ ures are clo@@ thed with f@@ locks ; the valleys also are covered over with corn ; they shout for joy , they also sing .
if I regard ini@@ qu@@ ity in my heart , the Lord will not hear me :
O let the nations be glad and sing for joy : for thou shalt judge the people righte@@ ously , and govern the nations upon earth . Sel@@ ah .
the ch@@ ari@@ ots of God are twenty thousand , even thousands of angels : the Lord is among them , as in Sinai , in the holy place .
thou hast asc@@ ended on high , thou hast led cap@@ tivity captive : thou hast received gifts for men ; ye@@ a , for the rebelli@@ ous also , that the LORD God might dwell among them .
but God shall wound the head of his enemies , and the hair@@ y scal@@ p of such an one as go@@ eth on still in his t@@ resp@@ asses .
the Lord said , I will bring again from Bash@@ an , I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea :
rebu@@ ke the company of spear@@ men , the multitude of the bul@@ ls , with the cal@@ ves of the people , till every one submit himself with pieces of silver : sc@@ atter thou the people that delight in war .
to him that ri@@ det@@ h upon the heavens of heavens , which were of old ; lo , he do@@ th send out his voice , and that a mighty voice .
but as for me , my prayer is unto thee , O LORD , in an acceptable time : O God , in the multitude of thy mercy hear me , in the truth of thy salvation .
repro@@ ach hath broken my heart ; and I am full of heav@@ iness : and I looked for some to take pity , but there was none ; and for comfor@@ ters , but I found none .
let their table become a sn@@ are before them : and that which should have been for their welfare , let it become a trap .
by thee have I been Hol@@ den up from the womb : thou art he that took me out of my mother 's bow@@ els : my praise shall be continually of thee .
now also when I am old and gra@@ y@@ headed , O God , for@@ sake me not ; until I have sh@@ ew@@ ed thy strength unto this generation , and thy power to every one that is to come .
he shall judge the poor of the people , he shall save the children of the ne@@ edy , and shall break in pieces the op@@ pres@@ sor .
therefore pride comp@@ ass@@ eth them about as a chain ; violence cover@@ eth them as a garment .
if I say , I will speak thus ; behold , I should offend against the generation of thy children .
they have cast fire into thy sanctuary , they have de@@ filed by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground .
O deliver not the soul of thy tur@@ t@@ le@@ do@@ ve unto the multitude of the wicked : forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever .
all the horns of the wicked also will I cut off ; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted .
for he established a testimony in Jacob , and appointed a law in Israel , which he commanded our fathers , that they should make them known to their children :
and might not be as their fathers , a stubborn and rebelli@@ ous generation ; a generation that set not their heart ari@@ ght , and whose spirit was not st@@ ed@@ fast with God .
he caused an east wind to blow in the heaven : and by his power he brought in the south wind .
but he , being full of compassion , for@@ gave their ini@@ qu@@ ity , and destroyed them not : ye@@ a , many a time turned he his anger away , and did not stir up all his wrath .
the dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the f@@ ow@@ ls of the heaven , the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth .
let the sigh@@ ing of the prisoner come before thee ; according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die ;
he should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat : and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee .
they know not , neither will they understand ; they walk on in darkness : all the foundations of the earth are out of course .
keep not thou silence , O God : hold not thy peace , and be not still , O God .
make their no@@ bles like O@@ re@@ b , and like Ze@@ eb : ye@@ a , all their princes as Ze@@ ba@@ h , and as Z@@ al@@ mun@@ na :
ye@@ a , the spar@@ row hath found an house , and the swallow a nest for herself , where she may lay her young , even th@@ ine al@@ t@@ ars , O LORD of hosts , my King , and my God .
bow down th@@ ine ear , O LORD , hear me : for I am poor and ne@@ edy .
teach me thy way , O LORD ; I will walk in thy truth : unite my heart to fear thy name .
for who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD ? who among the sons of the mighty can be lik@@ ened unto the LORD ?
God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints , and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him .
then thou sp@@ ak@@ est in vision to thy holy one , and s@@ ai@@ d@@ st , I have laid help upon one that is mighty ; I have exalted one chosen out of the people .
and let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us : and establish thou the work of our hands upon us ; ye@@ a , the work of our hands establish thou it .
he that dwell@@ eth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty .
the LORD re@@ ig@@ neth , he is clo@@ thed with maj@@ esty ; the LORD is clo@@ thed with strength , where@@ with he hath gir@@ ded himself : the world also is st@@ ablis@@ hed , that it C@@ AN@@ NOT be moved .
unless the LORD had been my help , my soul had almost d@@ wel@@ t in silence .
when I said , My foot sli@@ pp@@ eth ; thy mercy , O LORD , held me up .
and he shall bring upon them their own ini@@ qu@@ ity , and shall cut them off in their own w@@ ick@@ edness ; ye@@ a , the LORD our God shall cut them off .
unto whom I sw@@ are in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest .
ye that love the LORD , hate evil : he preserv@@ eth the souls of his saints ; he deliver@@ eth them out of the hand of the wicked .
make a joyful noise unto the LORD , all the earth : make a loud noise , and rejoice , and sing praise .
wh@@ os@@ o priv@@ ily slan@@ der@@ eth his neighbour , him will I cut off : him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer .
but the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him , and his righteousness unto children 's children ;
to such as keep his covenant , and to those that remember his commandments to do them .
he caus@@ eth the grass to grow for the cattle , and her@@ b for the service of man : that he may bring forth food out of the earth ;
praise ye the LORD . O give thanks unto the LORD ; for he is good : for his mercy endu@@ re@@ th for ever .
that I may see the good of thy chosen , that I may rejoice in the gl@@ ad@@ ness of thy nation , that I may glory with th@@ ine inheritance .
O God , my heart is fixed ; I will sing and give praise , even with my glory .
for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the dece@@ it@@ ful are opened against me : they have spoken against me with a lying tongue .
thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power , in the be@@ au@@ ties of hol@@ iness from the womb of the morning : thou hast the de@@ w of thy youth .
he shall judge among the he@@ a@@ then , he shall fill the places with the dead bodies ; he shall wound the heads over many countries .
the wicked shall see it , and be griev@@ ed ; he shall gn@@ ash with his teeth , and melt away : the desire of the wicked shall perish .
he mak@@ eth the bar@@ ren woman to keep house , and to be a joyful mother of children . praise ye the LORD .
the heaven , even the heavens , are the LORD 's : but the earth hath he given to the children of men .
in the courts of the LORD 's house , in the midst of thee , O Jerusalem . praise ye the LORD .
they comp@@ assed me about ; ye@@ a , they comp@@ assed me about : but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them .
blessed be he that com@@ eth in the name of the LORD : we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD .
thy testim@@ onies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful .
let th@@ ine hand help me ; for I have chosen thy prec@@ epts .
in my distress I cried unto the LORD , and he heard me .
whi@@ ther the tribes go up , the tribes of the LORD , unto the testimony of Israel , to give thanks unto the name of the LORD .
peace be within thy walls , and prosperity within thy palaces .
our soul is exceedingly filled with the scor@@ ning of those that are at ease , and with the contempt of the proud .
do good , O LORD , unto those that be good , and to them that are upright in their hearts .
as for such as turn aside unto their cro@@ oked ways , the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of ini@@ qu@@ ity : but peace shall be upon Israel .
he that go@@ eth forth and we@@ ep@@ eth , bearing precious seed , shall doub@@ tless come again with rejo@@ icing , bringing his she@@ aves with him .
surely I have behaved and qui@@ eted myself , as a child that is we@@ an@@ ed of his mother : my soul is even as a we@@ an@@ ed child .
if thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them , their children shall also sit upon thy throne for ever@@ more .
it is like the precious o@@ int@@ ment upon the head , that ran down upon the beard , even Aaron 's beard : that went down to the skirts of his garments ;
as the de@@ w of Her@@ mon , and as the de@@ w that descended upon the mountains of Z@@ ion : for there the LORD commanded the blessing , even life for ever@@ more .
praise ye the LORD . praise ye the name of the LORD ; praise him , O ye servants of the LORD .
for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song ; and they that wasted us required of us mir@@ th , saying , S@@ ing us one of the songs of Z@@ ion .
though I walk in the midst of trouble , thou wil@@ t revive me : thou shalt stretch forth th@@ ine hand against the wrath of mine enemies , and thy right hand shall save me .
the LORD will perfect that which concer@@ neth me : thy mercy , O LORD , endu@@ re@@ th for ever : for@@ sake not the works of th@@ ine own hands .
O LORD , thou hast searched me , and known me .
thou know@@ est my down@@ sitting and mine uprising , thou understand@@ est my thought af@@ ar off .
the proud have hid a sn@@ are for me , and cor@@ ds ; they have spread a net by the way@@ side ; they have set gins for me . Sel@@ ah .
as for the head of those that compass me about , let the mis@@ chief of their own lips cover them .
for the enemy hath persecuted my soul ; he hath sm@@ it@@ ten my life down to the ground ; he hath made me to dwell in darkness , as those that have been long dead .
the LORD open@@ eth the eyes of the blind : the LORD ra@@ is@@ eth them that are bowed down : the LORD lov@@ eth the righteous :
let them praise the name of the LORD : for he commanded , and they were created .
he hath also st@@ ablis@@ hed them for ever and ever : he hath made a decree which shall not pass .
kings of the earth , and all people ; princes , and all judges of the earth :
if they say , Come with us , let us lay wait for blood , let us lur@@ k priv@@ ily for the innocent without cause :
so are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain ; which tak@@ eth away the life of the owners thereof .
turn you at my re@@ proof : behold , I will pour out my spirit unto you , I will make known my words unto you .
he lay@@ eth up sound wisdom for the righteous : he is a Buck@@ ler to them that walk upri@@ gh@@ tly .

I have taught thee in the way of wisdom ; I have led thee in right paths .
let her be as the loving h@@ ind and pleasant ro@@ e ; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times ; and be thou ra@@ vis@@ hed always with her love .
his own ini@@ qu@@ ities shall take the wicked himself , and he shall be Hol@@ den with the cor@@ ds of his sins .
he shall die without instruction ; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astr@@ ay .
for the commandment is a lamp ; and the law is light ; and re@@ proof@@ s of instruction are the way of life :

therefore came I forth to meet thee , dilig@@ ently to seek thy face , and I have found thee .
he hath taken a bag of money with him , and will come home at the day appointed .

she cri@@ eth at the gates , at the entry of the city , at the coming in at the doors .
all the words of my mouth are in righteousness ; there is nothing fro@@ ward or perverse in them .

the back@@ slider in heart shall be filled with his own ways : and a good man shall be satisfied from himself .
in all labour there is profit : but the talk of the lips ten@@ det@@ h only to pen@@ ury .

in the house of the righteous is much treasure : but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble .
the way of the wicked is an ab@@ om@@ ination unto the LORD : but he lov@@ eth him that follow@@ eth after righteousness .

folly is joy to him that is des@@ tit@@ ute of wisdom : but a man of understanding wal@@ ket@@ h upri@@ gh@@ tly .
the LORD hath made all things for himself : ye@@ a , even the wicked for the day of evil .
when a man 's ways please the LORD , he mak@@ eth even his enemies to be at peace with him .
in the light of the king 's coun@@ tenance is life ; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain .
the wise in heart shall be called prudent : and the sweet@@ ness of the lips increas@@ eth learning .
understanding is a well@@ spring of life unto him that hath it : but the instruction of fo@@ ols is folly .
there is a way that seem@@ eth right unto a man , but the end thereof are the ways of death .
a violent man entic@@ eth his neighbour , and lead@@ eth him into the way that is not good .
children 's children are the crown of old men ; and the glory of children are their fathers .

wisdom is before him that hath understanding ; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth .
better is the poor that wal@@ ket@@ h in his integrity , than he that is perverse in his lips , and is a fool .
many will int@@ re@@ at the favour of the prince : and every man is a friend to him that gi@@ v@@ eth gifts .

the king 's wrath is as the ro@@ aring of a lion ; but his favour is as de@@ w upon the grass .
a foolish son is the calamity of his father : and the cont@@ entions of a wife are a continual dropping .

it is an honour for a man to cease from strife : but every fool will be meddling .

as the cold of snow in the time of harvest , so is a faithful messenger to them that send him : for he refresh@@ eth the soul of his masters .
confidence in an un@@ faithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth , and a foot out of joint .
as he that tak@@ eth away a garment in cold weather , and as vin@@ eg@@ ar upon nit@@ re , so is he that sing@@ eth songs to an heavy heart .
if th@@ ine enemy be hungry , give him bread to eat ; and if he be thir@@ sty , give him water to drink :
he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down , and without walls .
as the bird by wandering , as the swallow by flying , so the curse ca@@ useless shall not come .
he that sen@@ det@@ h a message by the hand of a fool cut@@ t@@ eth off the feet , and drin@@ ket@@ h damage .
where no wood is , there the fire go@@ eth out : so where there is no tal@@ e@@ be@@ arer , the strife ceas@@ eth .
a lying tongue hat@@ eth those that are afflicted by it ; and a fl@@ attering mouth work@@ eth ruin .
a stone is heavy , and the sand weigh@@ ty ; but a fool 's wrath is heavier than them both .
as a bird that wan@@ der@@ eth from her nest , so is a man that wan@@ der@@ eth from his place .
o@@ int@@ ment and perf@@ ume rejoice the heart : so do@@ th the sweet@@ ness of a man 's friend by hearty counsel .
th@@ ine own friend , and thy father 's friend , for@@ sake not ; neither go into thy brother 's house in the day of thy calamity : for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off .
though thou shoul@@ dest br@@ ay a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pe@@ st@@ le , yet will not his fool@@ is@@ hness depart from him .
for the trans@@ g@@ ression of a land many are the princes thereof : but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged .
they that for@@ sake the law praise the wicked : but such as keep the law contend with them .
the rich man is wise in his own conce@@ it ; but the poor that hath understanding search@@ eth him out .
when righteous men do rejoice , there is great glory : but when the wicked rise , a man is hidden .
a faithful man shall abound with blessings : but he that mak@@ eth ha@@ ste to be rich shall not be innocent .
to have respect of persons is not good : for for a piece of bread that man will trans@@ gress .
he that ha@@ st@@ eth to be rich hath an evil eye , and consider@@ eth not that poverty shall come upon him .
when the righteous are in authority , the people rejoice : but when the wicked be@@ areth rule , the people mour@@ n .
the righteous consider@@ eth the cause of the poor : but the wicked regar@@ det@@ h not to know it .
correct thy son , and he shall give thee rest ; ye@@ a , he shall give delight unto thy soul .
an unjust man is an ab@@ om@@ ination to the just : and he that is upright in the way is ab@@ om@@ ination to the wicked .
the words of A@@ gu@@ r the son of J@@ ake@@ h , even the prophecy : the man sp@@ ake unto I@@ thi@@ el , even unto I@@ thi@@ el and U@@ cal ,
who hath asc@@ ended up into heaven , or descended ? who hath gathered the wind in his fi@@ sts ? who hath bound the waters in a garment ? who hath established all the ends of the earth ? what is his name , and what is his son 's name , if thou can@@ st tell ?
there is a generation , whose teeth are as s@@ words , and their jaw teeth as kni@@ ves , to dev@@ our the poor from off the earth , and the ne@@ edy from among men .
the hor@@ sel@@ each hath two daughters , crying , Gi@@ ve , give . there are three things that are never satisfied , ye@@ a , four things say not , It is enough :
if thou hast done fool@@ ishly in lifting up thy@@ self , or if thou hast thought evil , lay th@@ ine hand upon thy mouth .
surely the chur@@ ning of milk br@@ ing@@ eth forth butter , and the wr@@ inging of the nose br@@ ing@@ eth forth blood : so the forcing of wrath br@@ ing@@ eth forth strife .
what , my son ? and what , the son of my womb ? and what , the son of my v@@ ows ?
it is not for kings , O Lem@@ u@@ el , it is not for kings to drink wine ; nor for princes strong drink :
the heart of her husband do@@ th safely trust in her , so that he shall have no need of spoil .
favour is dece@@ it@@ ful , and beauty is vain : but a woman that fe@@ areth the LORD , she shall be praised .
I commun@@ ed with mine own heart , saying , L@@ o , I am come to great estate , and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem : ye@@ a , my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge .
I made me gardens and or@@ char@@ ds , and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits :
and I turned myself to behold wisdom , and madness , and folly : for what can the man do that com@@ eth after the king ? even that which hath been already done .
for there is no rem@@ embrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever ; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten . and how Di@@ eth the wise man ? as the fool .
for there is a man whose labour is in wisdom , and in knowledge , and in equity ; yet to a man that hath not lab@@ oured therein shall he leave it for his portion . this also is van@@ ity and a great evil .
there is nothing better for a man , than that he should eat and drink , and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour . this also I saw , that it was from the hand of God .
he hath made every thing beautiful in his time : also he hath set the world in their heart , so that no man can find out the work that God mak@@ eth from the beginning to the end .
I know that there is no good in them , but for a man to rejoice , and to do good in his life .
and moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment , that w@@ ick@@ edness was there ; and the place of righteousness , that ini@@ qu@@ ity was there .
for that which be@@ fall@@ eth the sons of men be@@ fall@@ eth beasts ; even one thing be@@ fall@@ eth them : as the one Di@@ eth , so Di@@ eth the other ; ye@@ a , they have all one breath ; so that a man hath no pre@@ emin@@ ence above a beast : for all is van@@ ity .
so I returned , and considered all the op@@ pressions that are done under the sun : and behold the tears of such as were oppressed , and they had no comfor@@ ter ; and on the side of their op@@ pres@@ sors there was power ; but they had no comfor@@ ter .
ye@@ a , better is he than both they , which hath not yet been , who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun .
again , I considered all trav@@ ail , and every right work , that for this a man is envi@@ ed of his neighbour . this is also van@@ ity and v@@ ex@@ ation of spirit .
better is an handful with qui@@ et@@ ness , than both the hands full with trav@@ ail and v@@ ex@@ ation of spirit .
for if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow : but w@@ oe to him that is alone when he fall@@ eth ; for he hath not another to help him up .
for out of prison he com@@ eth to reign ; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becom@@ eth poor .
if thou se@@ est the oppression of the poor , and violent perver@@ ting of judgment and justice in a province , mar@@ vel not at the matter : for he that is higher than the highest regar@@ det@@ h ; and there be higher than they .
moreover he hath not seen the sun , nor known any thing : this hath more rest than the other .
for what hath the wise more than the fool ? what hath the poor , that know@@ eth to walk before the living ?
better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire : this is also van@@ ity and v@@ ex@@ ation of spirit .
for who know@@ eth what is good for man in this life , all the days of his vain life which he sp@@ en@@ det@@ h as a shadow ? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun ?
it is better to go to the house of mourning , than to go to the house of fe@@ asting : for that is the end of all men ; and the living will lay it to his heart .
sorrow is better than laughter : for by the sadness of the coun@@ tenance the heart is made better .
in the day of prosperity be joyful , but in the day of ad@@ versity consider : God also hath set the one over against the other , to the end that man should find nothing after him .
it is good that thou shoul@@ dest take hold of this ; ye@@ a , also from this withdraw not th@@ ine hand : for he that fe@@ areth God shall come forth of them all .
I applied mine heart to know , and to search , and to seek out wisdom , and the reason of things , and to know the w@@ ick@@ edness of folly , even of fool@@ is@@ hness and madness :
I counsel thee to keep the king 's commandment , and that in regard of the oath of God .
wh@@ os@@ o keep@@ eth the commandment shall feel no evil thing : and a wise man 's heart discer@@ neth both time and judgment .
there is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit ; neither hath he power in the day of death : and there is no discharge in that war ; neither shall w@@ ick@@ edness deliver those that are given to it .
because sentence against an evil work is not executed spe@@ ed@@ ily , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil .
though a sinner do evil an hundred times , and his days be prolonged , yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God , which fear before him :
but it shall not be well with the wicked , neither shall he prolong his days , which are as a shadow ; because he fe@@ areth not before God .
then I commended mir@@ th , because a man hath no better thing under the sun , than to eat , and to drink , and to be mer@@ ry : for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life , which God gi@@ v@@ eth him under the sun .
for the living know that they shall die : but the dead know not any thing , neither have they any more a reward ; for the memory of them is forgotten .
also their love , and their hatred , and their envy , is now perished ; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun .
for man also know@@ eth not his time : as the f@@ ishes that are taken in an evil net , and as the birds that are caught in the sn@@ are ; so are the sons of men sn@@ ared in an evil time , when it fall@@ eth suddenly upon them .
there was a little city , and few men within it ; and there came a great king against it , and be@@ sieg@@ ed it , and built great bul@@ war@@ ks against it :
dead flies cause the o@@ int@@ ment of the ap@@ oth@@ ec@@ ary to send forth a st@@ inking sav@@ our : so do@@ th a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour .
a wise man 's heart is at his right hand ; but a fool 's heart at his left .
ye@@ a also , when he that is a fool wal@@ ket@@ h by the way , his wisdom fail@@ eth him , and he sa@@ ith to every one that he is a fool .
if the iron be blunt , and he do not wh@@ et the edge , then must he put to more strength : but wisdom is profitable to direct .
a fool also is full of words : a man C@@ AN@@ NOT tell what shall be ; and what shall be after him , who can tell him ?
give a portion to seven , and also to eight ; for thou know@@ est not what evil shall be upon the earth .
if the clouds be full of rain , they empty themselves upon the earth : and if the tree fall toward the south , or toward the north , in the place where the tree fall@@ eth , there it shall be .
in the day when the keepers of the house shall trem@@ ble , and the strong men shall bow themselves , and the gr@@ inders cease because they are few , and those that look out of the windows be dark@@ ened ,
or ever the silver cord be loos@@ ed , or the golden bowl be broken , or the p@@ itch@@ er be broken at the fountain , or the wheel broken at the ci@@ stern .
and moreover , because the preacher was wise , he still taught the people knowledge ; ye@@ a , he gave good heed , and sought out , and set in order many prover@@ bs .
let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter : fear God , and keep his commandments : for this is the whole duty of man .
as the apple tree among the trees of the wood , so is my beloved among the sons . I sat down under his shadow with great delight , and his fruit was sweet to my taste .
my beloved is like a ro@@ e or a young hart : behold , he stand@@ eth behind our wall , he loo@@ ket@@ h forth at the windows , sh@@ ew@@ ing himself through the lat@@ tice .
my beloved sp@@ ake , and said unto me , R@@ ise up , my love , my fair one , and come away .
the fi@@ g tree put@@ t@@ eth forth her green fi@@ gs , and the v@@ ines with the tender grap@@ e give a good smell . arise , my love , my fair one , and come away .
I will rise now , and go about the city in the streets , and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul lov@@ eth : I sought him , but I found him not .
who is this that com@@ eth out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke , perf@@ um@@ ed with my@@ rr@@ h and frank@@ inc@@ ense , with all pow@@ ders of the merchant ?
behold his bed , which is Solomon 's ; thre@@ es@@ core val@@ i@@ ant men are about it , of the val@@ i@@ ant of Israel .
he made the pillars thereof of silver , the bottom thereof of gold , the covering of it of purple , the midst thereof being paved with love , for the daughters of Jerusalem .
go forth , O ye daughters of Z@@ ion , and behold king Solomon with the crown where@@ with his mother crowned him in the day of his esp@@ ous@@ als , and in the day of the gl@@ ad@@ ness of his heart .
behold , thou art fair , my love ; behold , thou art fair ; thou hast d@@ oves ' eyes within thy locks : thy hair is as a flock of goats , that appear from mount Gil@@ e@@ ad .
thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shor@@ n , which came up from the washing ; where@@ of every one bear twins , and none is bar@@ ren among them .
thy lips are like a thread of scar@@ let , and thy speech is com@@ ely : thy temples are like a piece of a p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate within thy locks .
until the day break , and the shadows flee away , I will get me to the mountain of my@@ rr@@ h , and to the hill of frank@@ inc@@ ense .
come with me from Lebanon , my spouse , with me from Lebanon : look from the top of A@@ man@@ a , from the top of Shen@@ ir and Her@@ mon , from the lions ' dens , from the mountains of the le@@ op@@ ards .
thy lips , O my spouse , drop as the honey@@ comb : honey and milk are under thy tongue ; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon .
my beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door , and my bow@@ els were moved for him .
I rose up to open to my beloved ; and my hands dropped with my@@ rr@@ h , and my fingers with sweet sm@@ elling my@@ rr@@ h , upon the handles of the lock .
I opened to my beloved ; but my beloved had withdrawn himself , and was gone : my soul failed when he sp@@ ake : I sought him , but I could not find him ; I called him , but he gave me no answer .
what is thy beloved more than another beloved , O thou fai@@ rest among women ? what is thy beloved more than another beloved , that thou d@@ ost so charge us ?
my beloved is gone down into his garden , to the beds of spices , to feed in the gardens , and to gather l@@ ilies .
I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley , and to see whether the vine flourished , and the p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates bud@@ ded .
and the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved , that go@@ eth down swe@@ etly , causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak .
I charge you , O daughters of Jerusalem , that ye stir not up , nor awake my love , until he please .
who is this that com@@ eth up from the wilderness , leaning upon her beloved ? I raised thee up under the apple tree : there thy mother brought thee forth : there she brought thee forth that bare thee .
Solomon had a viney@@ ard at Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ Ham@@ on ; he let out the viney@@ ard unto keepers ; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver .
my viney@@ ard , which is mine , is before me : thou , O Solomon , must have a thousand , and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred .
thou that dwell@@ est in the gardens , the companions hear@@ ken to thy voice : cause me to hear it .
the vision of Isaiah the son of A@@ mo@@ z , which he saw concerning Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem in the days of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , Jo@@ th@@ am , A@@ haz , and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , kings of Jud@@ ah .
hear , O heavens , and give ear , O earth : for the LORD hath spoken , I have nourished and brought up children , and they have reb@@ elled against me .
why should ye be stricken any more ? ye will revolt more and more : the whole head is sick , and the whole heart faint .
your country is des@@ ol@@ ate , your cities are burned with fire : your land , strangers dev@@ our it in your presence , and it is des@@ ol@@ ate , as overthrown by strangers .
and the daughter of Z@@ ion is left as a cottage in a viney@@ ard , as a lodge in a garden of c@@ uc@@ um@@ bers , as a be@@ sieg@@ ed city .
except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remn@@ ant , we should have been as So@@ dom , and we should have been like unto Gom@@ or@@ rah .
bring no more vain ob@@ l@@ ations ; inc@@ ense is an ab@@ om@@ ination unto me ; the new mo@@ ons and sab@@ baths , the calling of assemblies , I C@@ AN@@ NOT away with ; it is ini@@ qu@@ ity , even the solemn meeting .
and when ye spread forth your hands , I will hide mine eyes from you : ye@@ a , when ye make many prayers , I will not hear : your hands are full of blood .
wash you , make you clean ; put away the evil of your do@@ ings from before mine eyes ; cease to do evil ;
come now , and let us reason together , sa@@ ith the LORD : though your sins be as scar@@ let , they shall be as white as snow ; though they be red like cri@@ m@@ son , they shall be as wool .
thy princes are rebelli@@ ous , and companions of thieves : every one lov@@ eth gifts , and follow@@ eth after rewards : they judge not the fa@@ ther@@ less , neither do@@ th the cause of the widow come unto them .
therefore sa@@ ith the Lord , the LORD of hosts , the mighty One of Israel , Ah , I will ease me of mine adversaries , and av@@ enge me of mine enemies :
and the strong shall be as to@@ w , and the maker of it as a spark , and they shall both burn together , and none shall qu@@ en@@ ch them .
and he shall judge among the nations , and shall rebu@@ ke many people : and they shall beat their s@@ words into pl@@ ow@@ shares , and their spe@@ ars into pr@@ un@@ in@@ gh@@ oo@@ ks : nation shall not lift up sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
their land also is full of silver and gold , neither is there any end of their treasures ; their land is also full of horses , neither is there any end of their ch@@ ari@@ ots :
their land also is full of idols ; they worship the work of their own hands , that which their own fingers have made :
and upon all the c@@ ed@@ ars of Lebanon , that are high and lifted up , and upon all the o@@ aks of Bash@@ an ,
in that day a man shall cast his idols of silver , and his idols of gold , which they made each one for himself to worship , to the mol@@ es and to the b@@ ats ;
and the people shall be oppressed , every one by another , and every one by his neighbour : the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient , and the base against the hon@@ our@@ able .
in that day shall he swear , saying , I will not be an heal@@ er ; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing : make me not a ruler of the people .
as for my people , children are their op@@ pres@@ sors , and women rule over them . O my people , they which lead thee cause thee to er@@ r , and destroy the way of thy paths .
the LORD will enter into judgment with the anci@@ ents of his people , and the princes thereof : for ye have eaten up the viney@@ ard ; the spoil of the poor is in your houses .
moreover the LORD sa@@ ith , Because the daughters of Z@@ ion are ha@@ u@@ ghty , and walk with stretched forth nec@@ ks and w@@ ant@@ on eyes , walking and min@@ cing as they go , and making a tin@@ k@@ ling with their feet :
in that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious , and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and com@@ ely for them that are escaped of Israel .
and the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Z@@ ion , and upon her assemblies , a cloud and smoke by day , and the shining of a fl@@ aming fire by night : for upon all the glory shall be a defence .
now will I sing to my well@@ beloved a song of my beloved touching his viney@@ ard . my well@@ beloved hath a viney@@ ard in a very fruitful hill :
and I will lay it waste : it shall not be pr@@ un@@ ed , nor di@@ gged ; but there shall come up bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns : I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it .
for the viney@@ ard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel , and the men of Jud@@ ah his pleasant plant : and he looked for judgment , but behold oppression ; for righteousness , but behold a cry .
w@@ oe unto them that join house to house , that lay field to field , till there be no place , that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth !
in mine ears said the LORD of hosts , Of a truth many houses shall be des@@ ol@@ ate , even great and fair , without inhabit@@ ant .
ye@@ a , ten acres of viney@@ ard shall yield one bath , and the seed of an Hom@@ er shall yield an ep@@ ha@@ h .
and the har@@ p , and the vi@@ ol , the tab@@ ret , and pipe , and wine , are in their fe@@ asts : but they regard not the work of the LORD , neither consider the operation of his hands .
therefore my people are gone into cap@@ tivity , because they have no knowledge : and their hon@@ our@@ able men are fam@@ ished , and their multitude dried up with thirst .
but the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment , and God that is holy shall be sancti@@ fied in righteousness .
that say , Let him make speed , and ha@@ sten his work , that we may see it : and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw ni@@ gh and come , that we may know it !
w@@ oe unto them that are mighty to drink wine , and men of strength to ming@@ le strong drink :
and he will lift up an en@@ sign to the nations from far , and will h@@ iss unto them from the end of the earth : and , behold , they shall come with speed swiftly :
and in that day they shall ro@@ ar against them like the ro@@ aring of the sea : and if one look unto the land , behold darkness and sorrow , and the light is dark@@ ened in the heavens thereof .
and one cried unto another , and said , Holy , holy , holy , is the LORD of hosts : the whole earth is full of his glory .
then said I , W@@ oe is me ! for I am un@@ done ; because I am a man of un@@ clean lips , and I dwell in the midst of a people of un@@ clean lips : for mine eyes have seen the King , the LORD of hosts .
then flew one of the ser@@ ap@@ him@@ s unto me , having a live coal in his hand , which he had taken with the t@@ ongs from off the altar :
and it came to pass in the days of A@@ haz the son of Jo@@ th@@ am , the son of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , king of Jud@@ ah , that Re@@ zin the king of Syria , and Pe@@ k@@ ah the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah , king of Israel , went up toward Jerusalem to war against it , but could not prevail against it .
and it was told the house of David , saying , Syria is con@@ feder@@ ate with E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im . and his heart was moved , and the heart of his people , as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind .
then said the LORD unto Isaiah , Go forth now to meet A@@ haz , thou , and S@@ hear @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ash@@ u@@ b thy son , at the end of the condu@@ it of the upper pool in the highway of the ful@@ ler 's field ;
and say unto him , Take heed , and be quiet ; fear not , neither be fain@@ the@@ ar@@ ted for the two tails of these smoking fire@@ brands , for the fierce anger of Re@@ zin with Syria , and of the son of Rem@@ ali@@ ah .
and he said , He@@ ar ye now , O house of David ; Is it a small thing for you to weary men , but will ye weary my God also ?
the LORD shall bring upon thee , and upon thy people , and upon thy father 's house , days that have not come , from the day that E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im departed from Jud@@ ah ; even the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
and they shall come , and shall rest all of them in the des@@ ol@@ ate valleys , and in the holes of the rocks , and upon all thor@@ ns , and upon all bushes .
and it shall come to pass , for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter : for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land .
and it shall come to pass in that day , that every place shall be , where there were a thousand v@@ ines at a thousand sil@@ ver@@ lings , it shall even be for bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns .
and on all hills that shall be di@@ gged with the mat@@ to@@ ck , there shall not come thi@@ ther the fear of bri@@ ers and thor@@ ns : but it shall be for the sending forth of ox@@ en , and for the t@@ reading of lesser cattle .
moreover the LORD said unto me , Take thee a great roll , and write in it with a man 's pen concerning Ma@@ her @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ al@@ al @@@ -@@ @ hash @@@ -@@ @ ba@@ z .
for before the child shall have knowledge to cry , My father , and my mother , the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Sam@@ aria shall be taken away before the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
and he shall pass through Jud@@ ah ; he shall over@@ flow and go over , he shall reach even to the neck ; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land , O Im@@ manuel .
take counsel together , and it shall come to n@@ ought ; speak the word , and it shall not stand : for God is with us .
for the LORD sp@@ ake thus to me with a strong hand , and instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this people , saying ,
and I will wait upon the LORD , that hi@@ det@@ h his face from the house of Jacob , and I will look for him .
behold , I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts , which dwell@@ eth in mount Z@@ ion .
to the law and to the testimony : if they speak not according to this word , it is because there is no light in them .
thou hast multiplied the nation , and not increased the joy : they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest , and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil .
for thou hast broken the y@@ oke of his burden , and the staff of his shoulder , the rod of his op@@ pres@@ sor , as in the day of Mi@@ dian .
for every battle of the warrior is with confused noise , and garments rolled in blood ; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire .
for unto us a child is born , unto us a son is given : and the government shall be upon his shoulder : and his name shall be called Won@@ der@@ ful , Coun@@ seller , The mighty God , The everlasting Father , The Prince of Peace .
and all the people shall know , even E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im and the inhabit@@ ant of Sam@@ aria , that say in the pride and st@@ out@@ ness of heart ,
therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Re@@ zin against him , and join his enemies together ;
the ancient and hon@@ our@@ able , he is the head ; and the prophet that teach@@ eth lies , he is the tail .
for the leaders of this people cause them to er@@ r ; and they that are led of them are destroyed .
and he shall s@@ nat@@ ch on the right hand , and be hungry ; and he shall eat on the left hand , and they shall not be satisfied : they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm :
Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im ; and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , Man@@ as@@ se@@ h : and they together shall be against Jud@@ ah . for all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
and what will ye do in the day of vis@@ itation , and in the des@@ ol@@ ation which shall come from far ? to whom will ye flee for help ? and where will ye leave your glory ?
without me they shall bow down under the prisoners , and they shall fall under the sl@@ ain . for all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
W@@ herefore it shall come to pass , that when the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Z@@ ion and on Jerusalem , I will punish the fruit of the st@@ out heart of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , and the glory of his high looks .
therefore shall the Lord , the Lord of hosts , send among his fat ones lean@@ ness ; and under his glory he shall kind@@ le a burning like the burning of a fire .
and the light of Israel shall be for a fire , and his Holy One for a flame : and it shall burn and dev@@ our his thor@@ ns and his bri@@ ers in one day ;
and shall consume the glory of his forest , and of his fruitful field , both soul and body : and they shall be as when a stand@@ ard@@ be@@ arer fain@@ t@@ eth .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D of hosts , O my people that dwell@@ est in Z@@ ion , be not afraid of the As@@ sy@@ rian : he shall sm@@ ite thee with a rod , and shall lift up his staff against thee , after the manner of Egypt .
and the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Mi@@ dian at the rock of O@@ re@@ b : and as his rod was upon the sea , so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt .
he is come to Ai@@ ath , he is passed to Mi@@ gr@@ on ; at Mic@@ h@@ mash he hath laid up his carriages :
lift up thy voice , O daughter of G@@ alli@@ m : cause it to be heard unto La@@ ish , O poor An@@ ath@@ o@@ th .
behold , the Lord , the LORD of hosts , shall lo@@ p the b@@ ough with terror : and the high ones of stature shall be he@@ wn down , and the ha@@ u@@ ghty shall be hum@@ bled .
they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain : for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD , as the waters cover the sea .
and in that day there shall be a root of Jes@@ se , which shall stand for an en@@ sign of the people ; to it shall the Genti@@ les seek : and his rest shall be glorious .
the envy also of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall depart , and the adversaries of Jud@@ ah shall be cut off : E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall not envy Jud@@ ah , and Jud@@ ah shall not ve@@ x E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
but they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines toward the west ; they shall spoil them of the east together : they shall lay their hand upon E@@ dom and Mo@@ ab ; and the children of Am@@ mon shall obey them .
and there shall be an highway for the remn@@ ant of his people , which shall be left , from As@@ sy@@ ria ; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt .
and in that day thou shalt say , O LORD , I will praise thee : though thou w@@ ast angry with me , th@@ ine anger is turned away , and thou comfor@@ t@@ ed@@ st me .
I have commanded my sancti@@ fied ones , I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger , even them that rejoice in my high@@ ness .
they come from a far country , from the end of heaven , even the LORD , and the weapons of his indignation , to destroy the whole land .
behold , the day of the LORD com@@ eth , cruel both with wrath and fierce anger , to lay the land des@@ ol@@ ate : and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it .
their children also shall be d@@ ashed to pieces before their eyes ; their houses shall be spoiled , and their wives ra@@ vis@@ hed .
and Babylon , the glory of king@@ doms , the beauty of the Chal@@ de@@ es ' excell@@ ency , shall be as when God over@@ threw So@@ dom and Gom@@ or@@ rah .
but wild beasts of the desert shall lie there ; and their houses shall be full of dol@@ eful creatures ; and ow@@ ls shall dwell there , and sat@@ yr@@ s shall dance there .
and the people shall take them , and bring them to their place : and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and hand@@ m@@ aids : and they shall take them cap@@ tives , whose cap@@ tives they were ; and they shall rule over their op@@ pres@@ sors .
and it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest from thy sorrow , and from thy fear , and from the hard bond@@ age where@@ in thou w@@ ast made to serve ,
that thou shalt take up this prover@@ b against the king of Babylon , and say , How hath the op@@ pres@@ sor ceased ! the golden city ceased !
hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming : it stir@@ re@@ th up the dead for thee , even all the chief ones of the earth ; it hath raised up from their thr@@ ones all the kings of the nations .
thy pom@@ p is brought down to the grave , and the noise of thy vi@@ ols : the worm is spread under thee , and the worms cover thee .
for thou hast said in th@@ ine heart , I will asc@@ end into heaven , I will ex@@ alt my throne above the stars of God : I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation , in the sides of the north :
they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee , and consider thee , saying , Is this the man that made the earth to trem@@ ble , that did shake king@@ doms ;
but thou art cast out of thy grave like an ab@@ om@@ in@@ able branch , and as the ra@@ iment of those that are sl@@ ain , thrust through with a sword , that go down to the stones of the pit ; as a car@@ case tro@@ dden under feet .
thou shalt not be joined with them in burial , because thou hast destroyed thy land , and sl@@ ain thy people : the seed of ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers shall never be renowned .
prepare slaughter for his children for the ini@@ qu@@ ity of their fathers ; that they do not rise , nor possess the land , nor fill the face of the world with cities .
for I will rise up against them , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , and cut off from Babylon the name , and remn@@ ant , and son , and ne@@ phe@@ w , sa@@ ith the LORD .
that I will break the As@@ sy@@ rian in my land , and upon my mountains t@@ read him under foot : then shall his y@@ oke depart from off them , and his burden depart from off their shoulders .
for the LORD of hosts hath pur@@ posed , and who shall dis@@ ann@@ ul it ? and his hand is stretched out , and who shall turn it back ?
rejoice not thou , whole Palest@@ ina , because the rod of him that smo@@ te thee is broken : for out of the ser@@ pent 's root shall come forth a cock@@ at@@ rice , and his fruit shall be a fiery flying ser@@ pent .
and the fir@@ st@@ born of the poor shall feed , and the ne@@ edy shall lie down in safety : and I will kill thy root with famine , and he shall sl@@ ay thy remn@@ ant .
how@@ l , O gate ; cry , O city ; thou , whole Palest@@ ina , art dissolved : for there shall come from the north a smoke , and none shall be alone in his appointed times .
the burden of Mo@@ ab . because in the night A@@ r of Mo@@ ab is laid waste , and brought to silence ; because in the night K@@ ir of Mo@@ ab is laid waste , and brought to silence ;
he is gone up to B@@ aj@@ ith , and to Di@@ bon , the high places , to we@@ ep : Mo@@ ab shall how@@ l over Ne@@ bo , and over Me@@ deb@@ a : on all their heads shall be bal@@ dness , and every beard cut off .
and H@@ esh@@ bon shall cry , and Ele@@ al@@ eh : their voice shall be heard even unto Ja@@ haz : therefore the armed soldiers of Mo@@ ab shall cry out ; his life shall be griev@@ ous unto him .
for the cry is gone round about the borders of Mo@@ ab ; the how@@ ling thereof unto E@@ gl@@ aim , and the how@@ ling thereof unto Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ eli@@ m .
for the waters of Dim@@ on shall be full of blood : for I will bring more upon Dim@@ on , lions upon him that escap@@ eth of Mo@@ ab , and upon the remn@@ ant of the land .
take counsel , execute judgment ; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the no@@ on@@ day ; hide the out@@ casts ; be@@ wr@@ ay not him that wan@@ der@@ eth .
and in mercy shall the throne be established : and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of David , judging , and seeking judgment , and ha@@ sting righteousness .
we have heard of the pride of Mo@@ ab ; he is very proud : even of his ha@@ u@@ ght@@ iness , and his pride , and his wrath : but his lies shall not be so .
therefore shall Mo@@ ab how@@ l for Mo@@ ab , every one shall how@@ l : for the foundations of K@@ ir @@@ -@@ @ ha@@ res@@ eth shall ye mour@@ n ; surely they are stricken .
and it shall come to pass , when it is seen that Mo@@ ab is weary on the high place , that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray ; but he shall not prevail .
but now the LORD hath spoken , saying , Within three years , as the years of an hi@@ rel@@ ing , and the glory of Mo@@ ab shall be contem@@ ned , with all that great multitude ; and the remn@@ ant shall be very small and fee@@ ble .
the burden of Damascus . behold , Damascus is taken away from being a city , and it shall be a ru@@ inous heap .
the fortress also shall cease from E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and the kingdom from Damascus , and the remn@@ ant of Syria : they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
and it shall be as when the har@@ vest@@ man gather@@ eth the corn , and re@@ ap@@ eth the ears with his arm ; and it shall be as he that gather@@ eth ears in the valley of Rep@@ ha@@ im .
in that day shall his strong cities be as a for@@ s@@ aken b@@ ough , and an up@@ per@@ most branch , which they left because of the children of Israel : and there shall be des@@ ol@@ ation .
because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation , and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength , therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants , and shalt set it with strange sli@@ ps :
in the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow , and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish : but the harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow .
the nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters : but God shall rebu@@ ke them , and they shall flee far off , and shall be ch@@ ased as the cha@@ ff of the mountains before the wind , and like a rolling thing before the whir@@ l@@ wind .
and behold at even@@ ing@@ tide trouble ; and before the morning he is not . this is the portion of them that spoil us , and the lot of them that rob us .
all ye inhabitants of the world , and dwellers on the earth , see ye , when he lif@@ t@@ eth up an en@@ sign on the mountains ; and when he blow@@ eth a trum@@ pet , hear ye .
the burden of Egypt . behold , the LORD ri@@ det@@ h upon a swift cloud , and shall come into Egypt : and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence , and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it .
and I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians : and they shall fight every one against his brother , and every one against his neighbour ; city against city , and kingdom against kingdom .
and the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord ; and a fierce king shall rule over them , sa@@ ith the Lord , the LORD of hosts .
the f@@ ish@@ ers also shall mour@@ n , and all they that cast angle into the bro@@ o@@ ks shall lam@@ ent , and they that spread nets upon the waters shall langu@@ ish .
surely the princes of Zo@@ an are fo@@ ols , the counsel of the wise counsel@@ lers of Phar@@ aoh is become bru@@ tish : how say ye unto Phar@@ aoh , I am the son of the wise , the son of ancient kings ?
where are they ? where are thy wise men ? and let them tell thee now , and let them know what the LORD of hosts hath pur@@ posed upon Egypt .
and the LORD shall be known to Egypt , and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day , and shall do sacrifice and ob@@ lation ; ye@@ a , they shall vo@@ w a vo@@ w unto the LORD , and perform it .
at the same time sp@@ ake the LORD by Isaiah the son of A@@ mo@@ z , saying , Go and loose the s@@ ack@@ cloth from off thy lo@@ ins , and put off thy shoe from thy foot . and he did so , walking naked and b@@ are@@ foot .
so shall the king of As@@ sy@@ ria lead away the Egyptians prisoners , and the Ethiop@@ ians cap@@ tives , young and old , naked and b@@ are@@ foot , even with their but@@ to@@ cks uncovered , to the shame of Egypt .
the burden of the desert of the sea . as whir@@ l@@ winds in the south pass through ; so it com@@ eth from the desert , from a terrible land .
therefore are my lo@@ ins filled with pain : p@@ ang@@ s have taken hold upon me , as the p@@ ang@@ s of a woman that tr@@ avail@@ eth : I was bowed down at the hearing of it ; I was dis@@ may@@ ed at the seeing of it .
and he cried , A lion : my lord , I stand continually upon the watch@@ tower in the daytime , and I am set in my ward whole nights :
and , behold , here com@@ eth a ch@@ ari@@ ot of men , with a couple of hor@@ sem@@ en . and he answered and said , Babylon is fallen , is fallen ; and all the gra@@ ven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground .
O my thresh@@ ing , and the corn of my floor : that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel , have I declared unto you .
the burden of Dum@@ ah . he call@@ eth to me out of Se@@ ir , Wat@@ ch@@ man , what of the night ? watch@@ man , what of the night ?
for they fled from the s@@ words , from the drawn sword , and from the bent bow , and from the griev@@ ousness of war .
the burden of the valley of vision . what ail@@ eth thee now , that thou art wholly gone up to the hous@@ et@@ ops ?
all thy rulers are fled together , they are bound by the arch@@ ers : all that are found in thee are bound together , which have fled from far .
therefore said I , Look away from me ; I will we@@ ep bit@@ terly , labour not to comfort me , because of the spo@@ iling of the daughter of my people .
ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David , that they are many : and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool .
and ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem , and the houses have ye broken down to forti@@ fy the wall .
and in that day did the Lord GO@@ D of hosts call to we@@ eping , and to mourning , and to bal@@ dness , and to gir@@ ding with s@@ ack@@ cloth :
and it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts , Su@@ rely this ini@@ qu@@ ity shall not be pur@@ ged from you till ye die , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D of hosts .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D of hosts , Go , get thee unto this treas@@ u@@ rer , even unto She@@ b@@ na , which is over the house , and say ,
what hast thou here ? and whom hast thou here , that thou hast he@@ wed thee out a se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re here , as he that he@@ w@@ eth him out a se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re on high , and that grav@@ eth an hab@@ itation for himself in a rock ?
he will surely violently turn and tos@@ s thee like a ball into a large country : there shalt thou die , and there the ch@@ ari@@ ots of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord 's house .
and I will clo@@ the him with thy robe , and strengthen him with thy gir@@ dle , and I will commit thy government into his hand : and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and to the house of Jud@@ ah .
and I will fast@@ en him as a nail in a sure place ; and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father 's house .
in that day , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , shall the nail that is fast@@ ened in the sure place be removed , and be cut down , and fall ; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off : for the LORD hath spoken it .
the burden of Ty@@ re . how@@ l , ye ships of Tar@@ sh@@ ish ; for it is laid waste , so that there is no house , no entering in : from the land of Ch@@ it@@ tim it is revealed to them .
and by great waters the seed of Si@@ h@@ or , the harvest of the river , is her revenue ; and she is a mar@@ t of nations .
be thou ashamed , O Z@@ id@@ on : for the sea hath spoken , even the strength of the sea , saying , I trav@@ ail not , nor bring forth children , neither do I nour@@ ish up young men , nor bring up vir@@ gins .
as at the report concerning Egypt , so shall they be so@@ rely p@@ ained at the report of Ty@@ re .
who hath taken this counsel against Ty@@ re , the crow@@ ning city , whose merchants are princes , whose traffickers are the hon@@ our@@ able of the earth ?
behold the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; this people was not , till the As@@ sy@@ rian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness : they set up the towers thereof , they raised up the palaces thereof ; and he brought it to ruin .
take an har@@ p , go about the city , thou har@@ lot that hast been forgotten ; make sweet melody , sing many songs , that thou may@@ est be remembered .
behold , the LORD mak@@ eth the earth empty , and mak@@ eth it waste , and tur@@ neth it upside down , and sc@@ atter@@ eth abroad the inhabitants thereof .
the land shall be utterly emp@@ tied , and utterly spoiled : for the LORD hath spoken this word .
the earth mour@@ neth and f@@ ad@@ eth away , the world langu@@ ish@@ eth and f@@ ad@@ eth away , the ha@@ u@@ ghty people of the earth do langu@@ ish .
the earth also is de@@ filed under the inhabitants thereof ; because they have trans@@ g@@ ressed the laws , changed the ordin@@ ance , broken the everlasting covenant .
therefore hath the curse dev@@ oured the earth , and they that dwell therein are des@@ ol@@ ate : therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned , and few men left .
the earth shall re@@ el to and fro like a drun@@ k@@ ard , and shall be removed like a cottage ; and the trans@@ g@@ ression thereof shall be heavy upon it ; and it shall fall , and not rise again .
and they shall be gathered together , as prisoners are gathered in the pit , and shall be shut up in the prison , and after many days shall they be visited .
then the moon shall be conf@@ ounded , and the sun ashamed , when the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Z@@ ion , and in Jerusalem , and before his anci@@ ents glori@@ ously .
O LORD , thou art my God ; I will ex@@ alt thee , I will praise thy name ; for thou hast done wonderful things ; thy coun@@ sels of old are faith@@ fulness and truth .
for thou hast made of a city an heap ; of a def@@ enced city a ruin : a palace of strangers to be no city ; it shall never be built .
for thou hast been a strength to the poor , a strength to the ne@@ edy in his distress , a refuge from the storm , a shadow from the heat , when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall .
and in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things , a feast of wines on the le@@ es , of fat things full of marrow , of wines on the le@@ es well refined .
and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people , and the V@@ ail that is spread over all nations .
and it shall be said in that day , L@@ o , this is our God ; we have waited for him , and he will save us : this is the LORD ; we have waited for him , we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation .
for in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest , and Mo@@ ab shall be tro@@ dden down under him , even as straw is tro@@ dden down for the dun@@ gh@@ ill .
and he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them , as he that swim@@ met@@ h spread@@ eth forth his hands to swim : and he shall bring down their pride together with the spo@@ ils of their hands .
thou wil@@ t keep him in perfect peace , whose mind is stayed on thee : because he trust@@ eth in thee .
ye@@ a , in the way of thy judgments , O LORD , have we waited for thee ; the desire of our soul is to thy name , and to the rem@@ embrance of thee .
let favour be sh@@ ew@@ ed to the wicked , yet will he not learn righteousness : in the land of upri@@ ghtness will he deal un@@ justly , and will not behold the maj@@ esty of the LORD .
O LORD our God , other lords beside thee have had dom@@ inion over us : but by thee only will we make mention of thy name .
they are dead , they shall not live ; they are deceased , they shall not rise : therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them , and made all their memory to perish .
come , my people , enter thou into thy chambers , and shut thy doors about thee : hide thy@@ self as it were for a little moment , until the indignation be over@@ past .
for , behold , the LORD com@@ eth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their ini@@ qu@@ ity : the earth also shall disclose her blood , and shall no more cover her sl@@ ain .
in that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish lev@@ i@@ athan the pierc@@ ing ser@@ pent , even lev@@ i@@ athan that cro@@ oked ser@@ pent ; and he shall sl@@ ay the dragon that is in the sea .
or let him take hold of my strength , that he may make peace with me ; and he shall make peace with me .
hath he sm@@ it@@ ten him , as he smo@@ te those that smo@@ te him ? or is he sl@@ ain according to the slaughter of them that are sl@@ ain by him ?
in measure , when it shoo@@ t@@ eth forth , thou wil@@ t debate with it : he st@@ ay@@ eth his rough wind in the day of the east wind .
yet the def@@ enced city shall be des@@ ol@@ ate , and the hab@@ itation for@@ s@@ aken , and left like a wilderness : there shall the cal@@ f feed , and there shall he lie down , and consume the branches thereof .
behold , the Lord hath a mighty and strong one , which as a temp@@ est of hail and a destroying storm , as a flood of mighty waters over@@ flowing , shall cast down to the earth with the hand .
to whom he said , This is the rest where@@ with ye may cause the weary to rest ; and this is the refreshing : yet they would not hear .
W@@ herefore hear the word of the LORD , ye scor@@ n@@ ful men , that rule this people which is in Jerusalem .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D , Be@@ hold , I lay in Z@@ ion for a foundation a stone , a tried stone , a precious corner stone , a sure foundation : he that believ@@ eth shall not make ha@@ ste .
and your covenant with death shall be dis@@ ann@@ ul@@ led , and your agreement with hell shall not stand ; when the over@@ flowing scourge shall pass through , then ye shall be tro@@ dden down by it .
from the time that it go@@ eth forth it shall take you : for morning by morning shall it pass over , by day and by night : and it shall be a v@@ ex@@ ation only to understand the report .
for the LORD shall rise up as in mount Per@@ az@@ im , he shall be w@@ ro@@ th as in the valley of Gi@@ be@@ on , that he may do his work , his strange work ; and bring to pass his act , his strange act .
now therefore be ye not mo@@ c@@ kers , lest your bands be made strong : for I have heard from the Lord GO@@ D of hosts a consumption , even determined upon the whole earth .
bread corn is bru@@ ised ; because he will not ever be thresh@@ ing it , nor break it with the wheel of his cart , nor bru@@ ise it with his hor@@ sem@@ en .
this also com@@ eth forth from the LORD of hosts , which is wonderful in counsel , and excellent in working .
and thou shalt be brought down , and shalt speak out of the ground , and thy speech shall be low out of the dust , and thy voice shall be , as of one that hath a familiar spirit , out of the ground , and thy speech shall whis@@ per out of the dust .
moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust , and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as cha@@ ff that pass@@ eth away : ye@@ a , it shall be at an instant suddenly .
and the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ari@@ el , even all that fight against her and her m@@ unition , and that distress her , shall be as a dream of a night vision .
W@@ herefore the Lord said , for@@ as@@ much as this people draw near me with their mouth , and with their lips do honour me , but have removed their heart far from me , and their fear toward me is taught by the prec@@ ept of men :
therefore , behold , I will proceed to do a marv@@ ell@@ ous work among this people , even a marv@@ ell@@ ous work and a wonder : for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish , and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid .
is it not yet a very little while , and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field , and the fruitful field shall be este@@ em@@ ed as a forest ?
the me@@ ek also shall increase their joy in the LORD , and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel .
for the terrible one is brought to n@@ ought , and the s@@ corner is consumed , and all that watch for ini@@ qu@@ ity are cut off :
therefore thus sa@@ ith the LORD , who re@@ deemed Abraham , concerning the house of Jacob , Jacob shall not now be ashamed , neither shall his face now wax pale .
but when he se@@ eth his children , the work of mine hands , in the midst of him , they shall sancti@@ fy my name , and sancti@@ fy the Holy One of Jacob , and shall fear the God of Israel .
w@@ oe to the rebelli@@ ous children , sa@@ ith the LORD , that take counsel , but not of me ; and that cover with a covering , but not of my spirit , that they may add sin to sin :
for the Egyptians shall help in vain , and to no purpose : therefore have I cried concerning this , Their strength is to sit still .
now go , write it before them in a table , and note it in a book , that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever :
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D , the Holy One of Israel ; In returning and rest shall ye be saved ; in qui@@ et@@ ness and in confidence shall be your strength : and ye would not .
for the people shall dwell in Z@@ ion at Jerusalem : thou shalt we@@ ep no more : he will be very gr@@ acious unto thee at the voice of thy cry ; when he shall hear it , he will answer thee .
and though the Lord give you the bread of ad@@ versity , and the water of afflic@@ tion , yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more , but th@@ ine eyes shall see thy teachers :
and th@@ ine ears shall hear a word behind thee , saying , This is the way , walk ye in it , when ye turn to the right hand , and when ye turn to the left .
ye shall def@@ ile also the covering of thy gra@@ ven images of silver , and the or@@ nament of thy mol@@ ten images of gold : thou shalt cast them away as a menstr@@ uous cloth ; thou shalt say unto it , Get thee hence .
then shall he give the rain of thy seed , that thou shalt sow the ground with@@ al ; and bread of the increase of the earth , and it shall be fat and pl@@ ent@@ eous : in that day shall thy cattle feed in large past@@ ures .
and there shall be upon every high mountain , and upon every high hill , rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter , when the towers fall .
moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun , and the light of the sun shall be sev@@ en@@ fold , as the light of seven days , in the day that the LORD b@@ ind@@ eth up the breach of his people , and heal@@ eth the stroke of their wound .
behold , the name of the LORD com@@ eth from far , burning with his anger , and the burden thereof is heavy : his lips are full of indignation , and his tongue as a dev@@ ouring fire :
and his breath , as an over@@ flowing stream , shall reach to the midst of the neck , to si@@ ft the nations with the si@@ eve of van@@ ity : and there shall be a bri@@ dle in the j@@ aws of the people , causing them to er@@ r .
and in every place where the grounded staff shall pass , which the LORD shall lay upon him , it shall be with tab@@ rets and har@@ ps : and in battles of shaking will he fight with it .
for T@@ oph@@ et is ordained of old ; ye@@ a , for the king it is prepared ; he hath made it deep and large : the pile thereof is fire and much wood ; the breath of the LORD , like a stream of bri@@ m@@ stone , do@@ th kind@@ le it .
now the Egyptians are men , and not God ; and their horses flesh , and not spirit . when the LORD shall stretch out his hand , both he that help@@ eth shall fall , and he that is hol@@ pen shall fall down , and they all shall fail together .
as birds flying , so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem ; defending also he will deliver it ; and passing over he will preserve it .
for in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver , and his idols of gold , which your own hands have made unto you for a sin .
and he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear , and his princes shall be afraid of the en@@ sign , sa@@ ith the LORD , whose fire is in Z@@ ion , and his furnace in Jerusalem .
and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind , and a covert from the temp@@ est ; as rivers of water in a dry place , as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land .
rise up , ye women that are at ease ; hear my voice , ye ca@@ reless daughters ; give ear unto my speech .
upon the land of my people shall come up thor@@ ns and bri@@ ers ; ye@@ a , upon all the houses of joy in the joy@@ ous city :
because the palaces shall be for@@ s@@ aken ; the multitude of the city shall be left ; the for@@ ts and towers shall be for dens for ever , a joy of wild asses , a past@@ ure of f@@ locks ;
until the spirit be poured upon us from on high , and the wilderness be a fruitful field , and the fruitful field be counted for a forest .
O LORD , be gr@@ acious unto us ; we have waited for thee : be thou their arm every morning , our salvation also in the time of trouble .
and your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the cat@@ er@@ pill@@ er : as the running to and fro of lo@@ cu@@ sts shall he run upon them .
the LORD is exalted ; for he dwell@@ eth on high : he hath filled Z@@ ion with judgment and righteousness .
and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times , and strength of salvation : the fear of the LORD is his treasure .
hear , ye that are far off , what I have done ; and , ye that are near , acknowledge my might .
he shall dwell on high : his place of defence shall be the mun@@ itions of rocks : bread shall be given him ; his waters shall be sure .
look upon Z@@ ion , the city of our solem@@ n@@ ities : th@@ ine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet hab@@ itation , a tab@@ ern@@ acle that shall not be taken down ; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed , neither shall any of the cor@@ ds thereof be broken .
thy tack@@ lings are loos@@ ed ; they could not well strengthen their m@@ ast , they could not spread the sail : then is the prey of a great spoil divided ; the lame take the prey .
come near , ye nations , to hear ; and hear@@ ken , ye people : let the earth hear , and all that is therein ; the world , and all things that come forth of it .
for the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations , and his fury upon all their armies : he hath utterly destroyed them , he hath delivered them to the slaughter .
their sl@@ ain also shall be cast out , and their st@@ ink shall come up out of their car@@ cases , and the mountains shall be melted with their blood .
for my sword shall be bath@@ ed in heaven : behold , it shall come down upon I@@ dum@@ ea , and upon the people of my curse , to judgment .
and the un@@ ic@@ or@@ ns shall come down with them , and the bul@@ locks with the bul@@ ls ; and their land shall be so@@ aked with blood , and their dust made fat with fat@@ ness .
and thor@@ ns shall come up in her palaces , net@@ tles and br@@ am@@ bles in the fort@@ resses thereof : and it shall be an hab@@ itation of dragons , and a court for ow@@ ls .
there shall the great owl make her nest , and lay , and hat@@ ch , and gather under her shadow : there shall the vul@@ tures also be gathered , every one with her mate .
seek ye out of the book of the LORD , and read : no one of these shall fail , none shall want her mate : for my mouth it hath commanded , and his spirit it hath gathered them .
say to them that are of a fearful heart , Be strong , fear not : behold , your God will come with vengeance , even God with a re@@ comp@@ ence ; he will come and save you .
then shall the lame man leap as an hart , and the tongue of the dumb sing : for in the wilderness shall waters break out , and streams in the desert .
and the par@@ ched ground shall become a pool , and the thir@@ sty land springs of water : in the hab@@ itation of dragons , where each lay , shall be grass with re@@ eds and r@@ ushes .
no lion shall be there , nor any ra@@ ven@@ ous beast shall go up there@@ on , it shall not be found there ; but the re@@ deemed shall walk there :
now it came to pass in the four@@ teenth year of king He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , that Sen@@ n@@ ach@@ eri@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ria came up against all the def@@ enced cities of Jud@@ ah , and took them .
and the king of As@@ sy@@ ria sent Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h from L@@ ach@@ ish to Jerusalem unto king He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah with a great army . and he stood by the condu@@ it of the upper pool in the highway of the ful@@ ler 's field .
then came forth unto him Eli@@ ak@@ im , Hil@@ ki@@ ah 's son , which was over the house , and She@@ b@@ na the scri@@ be , and Jo@@ ah , As@@ ap@@ h 's son , the recorder .
I say , say@@ est thou , ( but they are but vain words ) I have counsel and strength for war : now on whom d@@ ost thou trust , that thou reb@@ ell@@ est against me ?
but if thou say to me , We trust in the LORD our God : is it not he , whose high places and whose al@@ t@@ ars He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah hath taken away , and said to Jud@@ ah and to Jerusalem , Y@@ e shall worship before this altar ?
now therefore give pledges , I pray thee , to my master the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , and I will give thee two thousand horses , if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them .
how then wil@@ t thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master 's servants , and put thy trust on Egypt for ch@@ ari@@ ots and for hor@@ sem@@ en ?
then said Eli@@ ak@@ im and She@@ b@@ na and Jo@@ ah unto Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h , Spe@@ ak , I pray thee , unto thy servants in the Syrian language ; for we understand it : and speak not to us in the Jews ' language , in the ears of the people that are on the wall .
but Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h said , H@@ ath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words ? hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall , that they may eat their own d@@ ung , and drink their own p@@ iss with you ?
then Rab@@ sha@@ ke@@ h stood , and cried with a loud voice in the Jews ' language , and said , He@@ ar ye the words of the great king , the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
neither let He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah make you trust in the LORD , saying , The LORD will surely deliver us : this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
hear@@ ken not to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah : for thus sa@@ ith the king of As@@ sy@@ ria , Make an agreement with me by a present , and come out to me : and eat ye every one of his vine , and every one of his fi@@ g tree , and drink ye every one the waters of his own ci@@ stern ;
beware lest He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah persuade you , saying , The LORD will deliver us . hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria ?
where are the gods of Ham@@ ath and Ar@@ p@@ had ? where are the gods of Sep@@ harv@@ aim ? and have they delivered Sam@@ aria out of my hand ?
who are they among all the gods of these lands , that have delivered their land out of my hand , that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand ?
and he sent Eli@@ ak@@ im , who was over the household , and She@@ b@@ na the scri@@ be , and the elders of the priests covered with s@@ ack@@ cloth , unto Isaiah the prophet the son of A@@ mo@@ z .
and Isaiah said unto them , Th@@ us shall ye say unto your master , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard , where@@ with the servants of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria have bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed me .
behold , I will send a blast upon him , and he shall hear a rum@@ our , and return to his own land ; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land .
thus shall ye speak to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , saying , Let not thy God , in whom thou trust@@ est , deceive thee , saying , Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah received the letter from the hand of the messengers , and read it : and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah went up unto the house of the LORD , and spread it before the LORD .
incl@@ ine th@@ ine ear , O LORD , and hear ; open th@@ ine eyes , O LORD , and see : and hear all the words of Sen@@ n@@ ach@@ eri@@ b , which hath sent to repro@@ ach the living God .
and have cast their gods into the fire : for they were no gods , but the work of men 's hands , wood and stone : therefore they have destroyed them .
now therefore , O LORD our God , save us from his hand , that all the king@@ doms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD , even thou only .
whom hast thou repro@@ ached and bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed ? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice , and lifted up th@@ ine eyes on high ? even against the Holy One of Israel .
I have di@@ gged , and drunk water ; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of the be@@ sieg@@ ed places .
hast thou not heard long ago , how I have done it ; and of ancient times , that I have formed it ? now have I brought it to pass , that thou shoul@@ dest be to lay waste def@@ enced cities into ru@@ inous he@@ aps .
therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dis@@ may@@ ed and conf@@ ounded : they were as the grass of the field , and as the green her@@ b , as the grass on the hous@@ et@@ ops , and as corn b@@ lasted before it be grown up .
and the remn@@ ant that is escaped of the house of Jud@@ ah shall again take root downward , and bear fruit upward :
and said , Rem@@ ember now , O LORD , I bes@@ e@@ ech thee , how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart , and have done that which is good in thy sight . and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah we@@ pt sore .
go , and say to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , the God of David thy father , I have heard thy prayer , I have seen thy tears : behold , I will add unto thy days fifteen years .
and this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD , that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken ;
behold , I will bring again the shadow of the degrees , which is gone down in the sun dial of A@@ haz , ten degrees backward . so the sun returned ten degrees , by which degrees it was gone down .
the writing of He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , when he had been sick , and was recovered of his sickness :
I said in the cutting off of my days , I shall go to the gates of the grave : I am deprived of the resi@@ due of my years .
I reck@@ oned till morning , that , as a lion , so will he break all my bones : from day even to night wil@@ t thou make an end of me .
like a crane or a swallow , so did I chat@@ ter : I did mour@@ n as a do@@ ve : mine eyes fail with looking upward : O LORD , I am oppressed ; undertake for me .
what shall I say ? he hath both spoken unto me , and himself hath done it : I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul .
behold , for peace I had great bitterness : but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption : for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back .
for the grave C@@ AN@@ NOT praise thee , death can not celebrate thee : they that go down into the pit C@@ AN@@ NOT hope for thy truth .
the LORD was ready to save me : therefore we will sing my songs to the str@@ ing@@ ed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD .
He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah also had said , What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD ?
at that time Mer@@ od@@ ach @@@ -@@ @ bal@@ adan , the son of Bal@@ adan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present to He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah : for he had heard that he had been sick , and was recovered .
then came Isaiah the prophet unto king He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , and said unto him , What said these men ? and from wh@@ ence came they unto thee ? and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah said , They are come from a far country unto me , even from Babylon .
behold , the days come , that all that is in th@@ ine house , and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day , shall be carried to Babylon : nothing shall be left , sa@@ ith the LORD .
and of thy sons that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt be@@ get , shall they take away ; and they shall be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s in the palace of the king of Babylon .
then said He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah to Isaiah , Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken . he said moreover , For there shall be peace and truth in my days .
speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem , and cry unto her , that her warfare is accomplished , that her ini@@ qu@@ ity is par@@ d@@ oned : for she hath received of the LORD 's hand double for all her sins .
every valley shall be exalted , and every mountain and hill shall be made low : and the cro@@ oked shall be made straight , and the rough places plain :
the voice said , C@@ ry . and he said , What shall I cry ? all flesh is grass , and all the good@@ liness thereof is as the flower of the field :
behold , the Lord GO@@ D will come with strong hand , and his arm shall rule for him : behold , his reward is with him , and his work before him .
with whom took he counsel , and who instructed him , and taught him in the path of judgment , and taught him knowledge , and sh@@ ew@@ ed to him the way of understanding ?
the work@@ man mel@@ t@@ eth a gra@@ ven image , and the g@@ old@@ sm@@ ith spread@@ eth it over with gold , and cast@@ eth silver chains .
he that is so impoverished that he hath no ob@@ lation choos@@ eth a tree that will not rot ; he see@@ ket@@ h unto him a cunning work@@ man to prepare a gra@@ ven image , that shall not be moved .
have ye not known ? have ye not heard ? hath it not been told you from the beginning ? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth ?
to whom then will ye lik@@ en me , or shall I be equal ? sa@@ ith the Holy One .
hast thou not known ? hast thou not heard , that the everlasting God , the LORD , the Creator of the ends of the earth , fain@@ t@@ eth not , neither is weary ? there is no searching of his understanding .
but they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength ; they shall mount up with wings as eag@@ les ; they shall run , and not be weary ; and they shall walk , and not faint .
keep silence before me , O islands ; and let the people renew their strength : let them come near ; then let them speak : let us come near together to judgment .
who raised up the righteous man from the east , called him to his foot , gave the nations before him , and made him rule over kings ? he gave them as the dust to his sword , and as driven stub@@ ble to his bow .
thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth , and called thee from the chief men thereof , and said unto thee , Th@@ ou art my servant ; I have chosen thee , and not cast thee away .
fear thou not ; for I am with thee : be not dis@@ may@@ ed ; for I am thy God : I will strengthen thee ; ye@@ a , I will help thee ; ye@@ a , I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness .
behold , all they that were incen@@ sed against thee shall be ashamed and conf@@ ounded : they shall be as nothing ; and they that strive with thee shall perish .
fear not , thou worm Jacob , and ye men of Israel ; I will help thee , sa@@ ith the LORD , and thy re@@ deem@@ er , the Holy One of Israel .
behold , I will make thee a new sharp thresh@@ ing instrument having teeth : thou shalt th@@ resh the mountains , and beat them small , and shalt make the hills as cha@@ ff .
thou shalt fan them , and the wind shall carry them away , and the whir@@ l@@ wind shall sc@@ atter them : and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD , and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel .
I have raised up one from the north , and he shall come : from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name : and he shall come upon princes as upon mor@@ ter , and as the pot@@ ter t@@ read@@ eth clay .
for I be@@ held , and there was no man ; even among them , and there was no coun@@ seller , that , when I asked of them , could answer a word .
a bru@@ ised re@@ ed shall he not break , and the smoking fla@@ x shall he not qu@@ en@@ ch : he shall bring forth judgment unto truth .
he shall not fail nor be discouraged , till he have set judgment in the earth : and the is@@ les shall wait for his law .
I the LORD have called thee in righteousness , and will hold th@@ ine hand , and will keep thee , and give thee for a covenant of the people , for a light of the Genti@@ les ;
I am the LORD : that is my name : and my glory will I not give to another , neither my praise to gra@@ ven images .
behold , the former things are come to pass , and new things do I declare : before they spring forth I tell you of them .
sing unto the LORD a new song , and his praise from the end of the earth , ye that go down to the sea , and all that is therein ; the is@@ les , and the inhabitants thereof .
let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice , the villages that K@@ edar do@@ th inhabit : let the inhabitants of the rock sing , let them shout from the top of the mountains .
the LORD shall go forth as a mighty man , he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war : he shall cry , ye@@ a , ro@@ ar ; he shall prevail against his enemies .
but this is a people robbed and spoiled ; they are all of them sn@@ ared in holes , and they are hid in prison houses : they are for a prey , and none deliver@@ eth ; for a spoil , and none sa@@ ith , Restore .
who gave Jacob for a spoil , and Israel to the rob@@ bers ? did not the LORD , he against whom we have sin@@ ned ? for they would not walk in his ways , neither were they obedient unto his law .
but now thus sa@@ ith the LORD that created thee , O Jacob , and he that formed thee , O Israel , Fe@@ ar not : for I have re@@ deemed thee , I have called thee by thy name ; thou art mine .
when thou pass@@ est through the waters , I will be with thee ; and through the rivers , they shall not over@@ flow thee : when thou walk@@ est through the fire , thou shalt not be burned ; neither shall the flame kind@@ le upon thee .
fear not : for I am with thee : I will bring thy seed from the east , and gather thee from the west ;
I will say to the north , Gi@@ ve up ; and to the south , Keep not back : bring my sons from far , and my daughters from the ends of the earth ;
ye are my witnesses , sa@@ ith the LORD , and my servant whom I have chosen : that ye may know and believe me , and understand that I am he : before me there was no God formed , neither shall there be after me .
I have declared , and have saved , and I have sh@@ ew@@ ed , when there was no strange god among you : therefore ye are my witnesses , sa@@ ith the LORD , that I am God .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , which mak@@ eth a way in the sea , and a path in the mighty waters ;
behold , I will do a new thing ; now it shall spring forth ; shall ye not know it ? I will even make a way in the wilderness , and rivers in the desert .
the beast of the field shall honour me , the dragons and the ow@@ ls : because I give waters in the wilderness , and rivers in the desert , to give drink to my people , my chosen .
thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings ; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices . I have not caused thee to serve with an offering , nor wear@@ ied thee with inc@@ ense .
thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money , neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices : but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins , thou hast wear@@ ied me with th@@ ine ini@@ qu@@ ities .
I , even I , am he that blo@@ tt@@ eth out thy trans@@ gres@@ sions for mine own sake , and will not remember thy sins .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD that made thee , and formed thee from the womb , which will help thee ; Fe@@ ar not , O Jacob , my servant ; and thou , Jes@@ ur@@ un , whom I have chosen .
for I will pour water upon him that is thir@@ sty , and floods upon the dry ground : I will pour my spirit upon thy seed , and my blessing upon th@@ ine offspring :
one shall say , I am the LORD 's ; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob ; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD , and surname himself by the name of Israel .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD the King of Israel , and his re@@ deem@@ er the LORD of hosts ; I am the first , and I am the last ; and beside me there is no God .
and who , as I , shall call , and shall declare it , and set it in order for me , since I appointed the ancient people ? and the things that are coming , and shall come , let them sh@@ ew unto them .
fear ye not , neither be afraid : have not I told thee from that time , and have declared it ? ye are even my witnesses . is there a God beside me ? ye@@ a , there is no God ; I know not any .
they that make a gra@@ ven image are all of them van@@ ity ; and their d@@ elec@@ table things shall not profit ; and they are their own witnesses ; they see not , nor know ; that they may be ashamed .
behold , all his fellows shall be ashamed : and the work@@ men , they are of men : let them all be gathered together , let them stand up ; yet they shall fear , and they shall be ashamed together .
he bur@@ neth part thereof in the fire ; with part thereof he e@@ at@@ eth flesh ; he ro@@ ast@@ eth ro@@ ast , and is satisfied : ye@@ a , he war@@ met@@ h himself , and sa@@ ith , A@@ ha , I am warm , I have seen the fire :
and the resi@@ due thereof he mak@@ eth a god , even his gra@@ ven image : he fall@@ eth down unto it , and worshi@@ pp@@ eth it , and pra@@ y@@ eth unto it , and sa@@ ith , Deli@@ ver me ; for thou art my god .
remember these , O Jacob and Israel ; for thou art my servant : I have formed thee ; thou art my servant : O Israel , thou shalt not be forgotten of me .
I have blo@@ tted out , as a thick cloud , thy trans@@ gres@@ sions , and , as a cloud , thy sins : return unto me ; for I have re@@ deemed thee .
sing , O ye heavens ; for the LORD hath done it : shout , ye lower parts of the earth : break forth into singing , ye mountains , O forest , and every tree therein : for the LORD hath re@@ deemed Jacob , and glori@@ fied himself in Israel .
that fru@@ strat@@ eth the tok@@ ens of the li@@ ars , and mak@@ eth div@@ in@@ ers mad ; that tur@@ neth wise men backward , and mak@@ eth their knowledge foolish ;
that sa@@ ith of Cy@@ rus , He is my shepherd , and shall perform all my pleasure : even saying to Jerusalem , Th@@ ou shalt be built ; and to the temple , Th@@ y foundation shall be laid .
and I will give thee the treasures of darkness , and hidden riches of secret places , that thou may@@ est know that I , the LORD , which call thee by thy name , am the God of Israel .
I am the LORD , and there is none else , there is no God beside me : I gir@@ ded thee , though thou hast not known me :
drop down , ye heavens , from above , and let the skies pour down righteousness : let the earth open , and let them bring forth salvation , and let righteousness spring up together ; I the LORD have created it .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , the Holy One of Israel , and his Maker , As@@ k me of things to come concerning my sons , and concerning the work of my hands command ye me .
I have made the earth , and created man upon it : I , even my hands , have stretched out the heavens , and all their host have I commanded .
I have raised him up in righteousness , and I will direct all his ways : he shall build my city , and he shall let go my cap@@ tives , not for price nor reward , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
they shall be ashamed , and also conf@@ ounded , all of them : they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols .
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD that created the heavens ; God himself that formed the earth and made it ; he hath established it , he created it not in vain , he formed it to be inhabited : I am the LORD ; and there is none else .
I have not spoken in secret , in a dark place of the earth : I said not unto the seed of Jacob , Se@@ ek ye me in vain : I the LORD speak righteousness , I declare things that are right .
look unto me , and be ye saved , all the ends of the earth : for I am God , and there is none else .
I have sworn by myself , the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness , and shall not return , That unto me every knee shall bow , every tongue shall swear .
surely , shall one say , in the LORD have I righteousness and strength : even to him shall men come ; and all that are incen@@ sed against him shall be ashamed .
B@@ el bow@@ eth down , Ne@@ bo sto@@ op@@ eth , their idols were upon the beasts , and upon the cattle : your carriages were heavy load@@ en ; they are a burden to the weary beast .
they st@@ oop , they bow down together ; they could not deliver the burden , but themselves are gone into cap@@ tivity .
and even to your old age I am he ; and even to ho@@ ar ha@@ irs will I carry you : I have made , and I will bear ; even I will carry , and will deliver you .
they lav@@ ish gold out of the bag , and weigh silver in the balance , and hire a g@@ old@@ sm@@ ith ; and he mak@@ eth it a god : they fall down , ye@@ a , they worship .
remember the former things of old : for I am God , and there is none else ; I am God , and there is none like me ,
I bring near my righteousness ; it shall not be far off , and my salvation shall not tar@@ ry : and I will place salvation in Z@@ ion for Israel my glory .
come down , and sit in the dust , O virgin daughter of Babylon , sit on the ground : there is no throne , O daughter of the Chal@@ de@@ ans : for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate .
take the mil@@ l@@ stones , and gr@@ ind meal : un@@ cover thy locks , make bare the leg , un@@ cover the thi@@ gh , pass over the rivers .
and thou s@@ ai@@ d@@ st , I shall be a lady for ever : so that thou did@@ st not lay these things to thy heart , neither did@@ st remember the latter end of it .
therefore hear now this , thou that art given to pleasures , that dwell@@ est ca@@ relessly , that say@@ est in th@@ ine heart , I am , and none else beside me ; I shall not sit as a widow , neither shall I know the loss of children :
stand now with th@@ ine enchan@@ tments , and with the multitude of thy sorcer@@ ies , where@@ in thou hast lab@@ oured from thy youth ; if so be thou shalt be able to profit , if so be thou may@@ est prevail .
thou art wear@@ ied in the multitude of thy coun@@ sels . let now the astro@@ log@@ ers , the St@@ arg@@ az@@ ers , the monthly prog@@ no@@ stic@@ ators , stand up , and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee .
behold , they shall be as stub@@ ble ; the fire shall burn them ; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame : there shall not be a coal to warm at , nor fire to sit before it .
for they call themselves of the holy city , and stay themselves upon the God of Israel ; The LORD of hosts is his name .
I have even from the beginning declared it to thee ; before it came to pass I sh@@ ew@@ ed it thee : lest thou shoul@@ dest say , M@@ ine idol hath done them , and my gra@@ ven image , and my mol@@ ten image , hath commanded them .
ye@@ a , thou hear@@ dest not ; ye@@ a , thou k@@ newest not ; ye@@ a , from that time that th@@ ine ear was not opened : for I knew that thou w@@ oul@@ dest deal very treach@@ er@@ ously , and w@@ ast called a trans@@ gres@@ sor from the womb .
for mine own sake , even for mine own sake , will I do it : for how should my name be polluted ? and I will not give my glory unto another .
hear@@ ken unto me , O Jacob and Israel , my called ; I am he ; I am the first , I also am the last .
all ye , assemble yourselves , and hear ; which among them hath declared these things ? the LORD hath loved him : he will do his pleasure on Babylon , and his arm shall be on the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
I , even I , have spoken ; ye@@ a , I have called him : I have brought him , and he shall make his way prosperous .
go ye forth of Babylon , flee ye from the Chal@@ de@@ ans , with a voice of singing declare ye , tell this , utter it even to the end of the earth ; say ye , The LORD hath re@@ deemed his servant Jacob .
and they thir@@ sted not when he led them through the deserts : he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them : he cl@@ ave the rock also , and the waters g@@ ushed out .
and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword ; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me , and made me a polished shaft ; in his qui@@ ver hath he hid me ;
then I said , I have lab@@ oured in vain , I have spent my strength for n@@ ought , and in vain : yet surely my judgment is with the LORD , and my work with my God .
and now , sa@@ ith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his servant , to bring Jacob again to him , Th@@ ough Israel be not gathered , yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD , and my God shall be my strength .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , In an acceptable time have I heard thee , and in a day of salvation have I helped thee : and I will preserve thee , and give thee for a covenant of the people , to establish the earth , to cause to inherit the des@@ ol@@ ate her@@ it@@ ages ;
that thou may@@ est say to the prisoners , Go forth ; to them that are in darkness , sh@@ ew yourselves . they shall feed in the ways , and their past@@ ures shall be in all high places .
they shall not hunger nor thirst ; neither shall the heat nor sun sm@@ ite them : for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them , even by the springs of water shall he guide them .
sing , O heavens ; and be joyful , O earth ; and break forth into singing , O mountains : for the LORD hath comfor@@ ted his people , and will have mercy upon his afflicted .
can a woman forget her su@@ cking child , that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb ? ye@@ a , they may forget , yet will I not forget thee .
the children which thou shalt have , after thou hast lost the other , shall say again in th@@ ine ears , The place is too str@@ ait for me : give place to me that I may dwell .
but thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Even the cap@@ tives of the mighty shall be taken away , and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered : for I will contend with him that cont@@ en@@ det@@ h with thee , and I will save thy children .
and I will feed them that op@@ press thee with their own flesh ; and they shall be drun@@ ken with their own blood , as with sweet wine : and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Re@@ deem@@ er , the mighty One of Jacob .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Where is the bill of your mother 's divor@@ cement , whom I have put away ? or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you ? behold , for your ini@@ qu@@ ities have ye sold yourselves , and for your trans@@ gres@@ sions is your mother put away .
the Lord GO@@ D hath given me the tongue of the learned , that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary : he w@@ ak@@ en@@ eth morning by morning , he w@@ ak@@ en@@ eth mine ear to hear as the learned .
for the Lord GO@@ D will help me ; therefore shall I not be conf@@ ounded : therefore have I set my face like a fl@@ int , and I know that I shall not be ashamed .
he is near that justi@@ fi@@ eth me ; who will contend with me ? let us stand together : who is mine adversary ? let him come near to me .
behold , the Lord GO@@ D will help me ; who is he that shall condemn me ? lo , they all shall wax old as a garment ; the moth shall eat them up .
who is among you that fe@@ areth the LORD , that obey@@ eth the voice of his servant , that wal@@ ket@@ h in darkness , and hath no light ? let him trust in the name of the LORD , and stay upon his God .
hear@@ ken to me , ye that follow after righteousness , ye that seek the LORD : look unto the rock wh@@ ence ye are he@@ wn , and to the hole of the pit wh@@ ence ye are di@@ gged .
for the LORD shall comfort Z@@ ion : he will comfort all her waste places ; and he will make her wilderness like Eden , and her desert like the garden of the LORD ; joy and gl@@ ad@@ ness shall be found therein , thank@@ s@@ giving , and the voice of melody .
hear@@ ken unto me , my people ; and give ear unto me , O my nation : for a law shall proceed from me , and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people .
my righteousness is near ; my salvation is gone forth , and mine arms shall judge the people ; the is@@ les shall wait upon me , and on mine arm shall they trust .
hear@@ ken unto me , ye that know righteousness , the people in whose heart is my law ; fear ye not the repro@@ ach of men , neither be ye afraid of their re@@ vil@@ ings .
awake , awake , put on strength , O arm of the LORD ; awake , as in the ancient days , in the generations of old . art thou not it that hath cut Ra@@ hab , and wounded the dragon ?
therefore the re@@ deemed of the LORD shall return , and come with singing unto Z@@ ion ; and everlasting joy shall be upon their head : they shall obtain gl@@ ad@@ ness and joy ; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away .
I , even I , am he that comfor@@ t@@ eth you : who art thou , that thou shoul@@ dest be afraid of a man that shall die , and of the son of man which shall be made as grass ;
and I have put my words in thy mouth , and I have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand , that I may plant the heavens , and lay the foundations of the earth , and say unto Z@@ ion , Th@@ ou art my people .
there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth ; neither is there any that tak@@ eth her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up .
these two things are come unto thee ; who shall be sorry for thee ? des@@ ol@@ ation , and destruction , and the famine , and the sword : by whom shall I comfort thee ?
thus sa@@ ith thy Lord the LORD , and thy God that ple@@ ad@@ eth the cause of his people , Be@@ hold , I have taken out of th@@ ine hand the cup of trembling , even the d@@ reg@@ s of the cup of my fury ; thou shalt no more drink it again :
awake , awake ; put on thy strength , O Z@@ ion ; put on thy beautiful garments , O Jerusalem , the holy city : for h@@ ence@@ forth there shall no more come into thee the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised and the un@@ clean .
shake thy@@ self from the dust ; arise , and sit down , O Jerusalem : loose thy@@ self from the bands of thy neck , O captive daughter of Z@@ ion .
now therefore , what have I here , sa@@ ith the LORD , that my people is taken away for n@@ ought ? they that rule over them make them to how@@ l , sa@@ ith the LORD ; and my name continually every day is bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed .
thy watch@@ men shall lift up the voice ; with the voice together shall they sing : for they shall see eye to eye , when the LORD shall bring again Z@@ ion .
for ye shall not go out with ha@@ ste , nor go by flight : for the LORD will go before you ; and the God of Israel will be your rer@@ ew@@ ard .
but he was wounded for our trans@@ gres@@ sions , he was bru@@ ised for our ini@@ qu@@ ities : the ch@@ as@@ tis@@ ement of our peace was upon him ; and with his stri@@ pes we are healed .
all we like sheep have gone astr@@ ay ; we have turned every one to his own way ; and the LORD hath laid on him the ini@@ qu@@ ity of us all .
he was taken from prison and from judgment : and who shall declare his generation ? for he was cut off out of the land of the living : for the trans@@ g@@ ression of my people was he stricken .
and he made his grave with the wicked , and with the rich in his death ; because he had done no violence , neither was any dece@@ it in his mouth .
enlarge the place of thy tent , and let them stretch forth the curtains of th@@ ine hab@@ itations : spare not , leng@@ then thy cor@@ ds , and strengthen thy stakes ;
fear not ; for thou shalt not be ashamed : neither be thou conf@@ ounded ; for thou shalt not be put to shame : for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth , and shalt not remember the repro@@ ach of thy wi@@ do@@ wh@@ ood any more .
for thy Maker is th@@ ine husband ; the LORD of hosts is his name ; and thy Re@@ deem@@ er the Holy One of Israel ; The God of the whole earth shall he be called .
in a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment ; but with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee , sa@@ ith the LORD thy Re@@ deem@@ er .
for this is as the waters of Noah unto me : for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth ; so have I sworn that I would not be w@@ ro@@ th with thee , nor rebu@@ ke thee .
for the mountains shall depart , and the hills be removed ; but my kindness shall not depart from thee , neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed , sa@@ ith the LORD that hath mercy on thee .
O thou afflicted , tos@@ sed with temp@@ est , and not comfor@@ ted , behold , I will lay thy stones with fair colours , and lay thy foundations with s@@ app@@ hi@@ res .
and all thy children shall be taught of the LORD ; and great shall be the peace of thy children .
in righteousness shalt thou be established : thou shalt be far from oppression ; for thou shalt not fear : and from terror ; for it shall not come near thee .
behold , I have created the sm@@ ith that blow@@ eth the co@@ als in the fire , and that br@@ ing@@ eth forth an instrument for his work ; and I have created the w@@ aster to destroy .
H@@ o , every one that thir@@ st@@ eth , come ye to the waters , and he that hath no money ; come ye , buy , and eat ; ye@@ a , come , buy wine and milk without money and without price .
W@@ herefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread ? and your labour for that which satis@@ fi@@ eth not ? hear@@ ken dilig@@ ently unto me , and eat ye that which is good , and let your soul delight itself in fat@@ ness .
behold , I have given him for a witness to the people , a leader and commander to the people .
behold , thou shalt call a nation that thou know@@ est not , and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the LORD thy God , and for the Holy One of Israel ; for he hath glori@@ fied thee .
let the wicked for@@ sake his way , and the un@@ righteous man his thoughts : and let him return unto the LORD , and he will have mercy upon him ; and to our God , for he will ab@@ und@@ antly pardon .
for as the heavens are higher than the earth , so are my ways higher than your ways , and my thoughts than your thoughts .
for as the rain com@@ eth down , and the snow from heaven , and re@@ tur@@ neth not thi@@ ther , but water@@ eth the earth , and mak@@ eth it bring forth and bud , that it may give seed to the s@@ ower , and bread to the e@@ ater :
for ye shall go out with joy , and be led forth with peace : the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing , and all the trees of the field shall cl@@ ap their hands .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Keep ye judgment , and do justice : for my salvation is near to come , and my righteousness to be revealed .
neither let the son of the stranger , that hath joined himself to the LORD , speak , saying , The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people : neither let the e@@ un@@ uch say , Be@@ hold , I am a dry tree .
even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters : I will give them an everlasting name , that shall not be cut off .
also the sons of the stranger , that join themselves to the LORD , to serve him , and to love the name of the LORD , to be his servants , every one that keep@@ eth the sab@@ bath from poll@@ uting it , and tak@@ eth hold of my covenant ;
even them will I bring to my holy mountain , and make them joyful in my house of prayer : their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar ; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people .
the Lord GO@@ D which gather@@ eth the out@@ casts of Israel sa@@ ith , Y@@ et will I gather others to him , beside those that are gathered unto him .
his watch@@ men are blind : they are all ignorant , they are all dumb dogs , they C@@ AN@@ NOT bark ; sleeping , lying down , loving to sl@@ umber .
ye@@ a , they are greedy dogs which can never have enough , and they are shep@@ herds that C@@ AN@@ NOT understand : they all look to their own way , every one for his gain , from his quarter .
come ye , say they , I will fetch wine , and we will fill ourselves with strong drink ; and to mor@@ row shall be as this day , and much more abundant .
the righteous per@@ ish@@ eth , and no man lay@@ eth it to heart : and mer@@ ciful men are taken away , none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come .
against whom do ye sport yourselves ? against whom make ye a wide mouth , and draw out the tongue ? are ye not children of trans@@ g@@ ression , a seed of false@@ hood ,
upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed : even thi@@ ther w@@ ent@@ est thou up to offer sacrifice .
and thou w@@ ent@@ est to the king with o@@ int@@ ment , and did@@ st increase thy perf@@ umes , and did@@ st send thy messengers far off , and did@@ st deb@@ ase thy@@ self even unto hell .
for thus sa@@ ith the high and lofty One that inhabit@@ eth eternity , whose name is Holy ; I dwell in the high and holy place , with him also that is of a contr@@ ite and humble spirit , to revive the spirit of the humble , and to revive the heart of the contr@@ ite ones .
for I will not contend for ever , neither will I be always w@@ ro@@ th : for the spirit should fail before me , and the souls which I have made .
for the ini@@ qu@@ ity of his co@@ vet@@ ousness was I w@@ ro@@ th , and smo@@ te him : I hid me , and was w@@ ro@@ th , and he went on fro@@ war@@ dly in the way of his heart .
I have seen his ways , and will heal him : I will lead him also , and restore comforts unto him and to his mour@@ ners .
then shall thy light break forth as the morning , and th@@ ine health shall spring forth spe@@ ed@@ ily : and thy righteousness shall go before thee ; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rer@@ ew@@ ard .
then shalt thou call , and the LORD shall answer ; thou shalt cry , and he shall say , Here I am . if thou take away from the midst of thee the y@@ oke , the putting forth of the finger , and speaking van@@ ity ;
and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry , and satisfy the afflicted soul ; then shall thy light rise in obs@@ cur@@ ity , and thy darkness be as the no@@ on@@ day :
they hat@@ ch cock@@ at@@ rice ' eggs , and we@@ ave the spider 's web : he that e@@ at@@ eth of their eggs Di@@ eth , and that which is crushed break@@ eth out into a vi@@ per .
their web@@ s shall not become garments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works : their works are works of ini@@ qu@@ ity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
we gro@@ pe for the wall like the blind , and we gro@@ pe as if we had no eyes : we stum@@ ble at no@@ on@@ day as in the night ; we are in des@@ ol@@ ate places as dead men .
for our trans@@ gres@@ sions are multiplied before thee , and our sins testify against us : for our trans@@ gres@@ sions are with us ; and as for our ini@@ qu@@ ities , we know them ;
for , behold , the darkness shall cover the earth , and gross darkness the people : but the LORD shall arise upon thee , and his glory shall be seen upon thee .
lift up th@@ ine eyes round about , and see : all they gather themselves together , they come to thee : thy sons shall come from far , and thy daughters shall be nur@@ sed at thy side .
surely the is@@ les shall wait for me , and the ships of Tar@@ sh@@ ish first , to bring thy sons from far , their silver and their gold with them , unto the name of the LORD thy God , and to the Holy One of Israel , because he hath glori@@ fied thee .
and the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls , and their kings shall minister unto thee : for in my wrath I smo@@ te thee , but in my favour have I had mercy on thee .
therefore thy gates shall be open continually ; they shall not be shut day nor night ; that men may bring unto thee the forces of the Genti@@ les , and that their kings may be brought .
thou shalt also su@@ ck the milk of the Genti@@ les , and shalt su@@ ck the breast of kings : and thou shalt know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Re@@ deem@@ er , the mighty One of Jacob .
the sun shall be no more thy light by day ; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee : but the LORD shall be unto thee an everlasting light , and thy God thy glory .
thy sun shall no more go down ; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself : for the LORD shall be th@@ ine everlasting light , and the days of thy mourning shall be ended .
thy people also shall be all righteous : they shall inherit the land for ever , the branch of my planting , the work of my hands , that I may be glori@@ fied .
and they shall build the old wastes , they shall raise up the former des@@ ol@@ ations , and they shall repair the waste cities , the des@@ ol@@ ations of many generations .
for your shame ye shall have double ; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion : therefore in their land they shall possess the double : everlasting joy shall be unto them .
for I the LORD love judgment , I hate robbery for burnt offering ; and I will direct their work in truth , and I will make an everlasting covenant with them .
and their seed shall be known among the Genti@@ les , and their offspring among the people : all that see them shall acknowledge them , that they are the seed which the LORD hath blessed .
for Z@@ ion 's sake will I not hold my peace , and for Jerusalem 's sake I will not rest , until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness , and the salvation thereof as a lamp that bur@@ neth .
and the Genti@@ les shall see thy righteousness , and all kings thy glory : and thou shalt be called by a new name , which the mouth of the LORD shall name .
for as a young man marri@@ eth a virgin , so shall thy sons marry thee : and as the bri@@ deg@@ room rejo@@ ic@@ eth over the bride , so shall thy God rejoice over thee .
but they that have gathered it shall eat it , and praise the LORD ; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my hol@@ iness .
and I looked , and there was none to help ; and I wondered that there was none to uphold : therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me ; and my fury , it upheld me .
and I will t@@ read down the people in mine anger , and make them drunk in my fury , and I will bring down their strength to the earth .
in all their afflic@@ tion he was afflicted , and the angel of his presence saved them : in his love and in his pity he re@@ deemed them ; and he bare them , and carried them all the days of old .
then he remembered the days of old , Moses , and his people , saying , Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock ? where is he that put his holy Spirit within him ?
that led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm , dividing the water before them , to make himself an everlasting name ?
as a beast go@@ eth down into the valley , the Spirit of the LORD caused him to rest : so did@@ st thou lead thy people , to make thy@@ self a glorious name .
look down from heaven , and behold from the hab@@ itation of thy hol@@ iness and of thy glory : where is thy zeal and thy strength , the sounding of thy bow@@ els and of thy mer@@ cies toward me ? are they restrained ?
the people of thy hol@@ iness have possessed it but a little while : our adversaries have tro@@ dden down thy sanctuary .
Oh that thou w@@ oul@@ dest ren@@ d the heavens , that thou w@@ oul@@ dest come down , that the mountains might flow down at thy presence ,
as when the melting fire bur@@ neth , the fire caus@@ eth the waters to boil , to make thy name known to th@@ ine adversaries , that the nations may trem@@ ble at thy presence !
for since the beginning of the world men have not heard , nor perceived by the ear , neither hath the eye seen , O God , beside thee , what he hath prepared for him that wa@@ it@@ eth for him .
thou me@@ et@@ est him that rejo@@ ic@@ eth and work@@ eth righteousness , those that remember thee in thy ways : behold , thou art w@@ ro@@ th ; for we have sin@@ ned : in those is continu@@ ance , and we shall be saved .
and there is none that call@@ eth upon thy name , that stir@@ re@@ th up himself to take hold of thee : for thou hast hid thy face from us , and hast consumed us , because of our ini@@ qu@@ ities .
be not w@@ ro@@ th very sore , O LORD , neither remember ini@@ qu@@ ity for ever : behold , see , we bes@@ e@@ ech thee , we are all thy people .
our holy and our beautiful house , where our fathers praised thee , is burned up with fire : and all our pleasant things are laid waste .
I am sought of them that asked not for me ; I am found of them that sought me not : I said , Be@@ hold me , behold me , unto a nation that was not called by my name .
which remain among the graves , and lodge in the monuments , which eat swine 's flesh , and bro@@ th of ab@@ om@@ in@@ able things is in their vessels ;
your ini@@ qu@@ ities , and the ini@@ qu@@ ities of your fathers together , sa@@ ith the LORD , which have burned inc@@ ense upon the mountains , and bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed me upon the hills : therefore will I measure their former work into their bos@@ om .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , As the new wine is found in the cluster , and one sa@@ ith , D@@ estro@@ y it not ; for a blessing is in it : so will I do for my servants ' s@@ akes , that I may not destroy them all .
and I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob , and out of Jud@@ ah an inher@@ itor of my mountains : and mine elect shall inherit it , and my servants shall dwell there .
but ye are they that for@@ sake the LORD , that forget my holy mountain , that prepare a table for that troop , and that fur@@ nish the drink offering unto that number .
and ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen : for the Lord GO@@ D shall sl@@ ay thee , and call his servants by another name :
that he who bl@@ ess@@ eth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth ; and he that swe@@ areth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth ; because the former troubles are forgotten , and because they are hid from mine eyes .
and I will rejoice in Jerusalem , and joy in my people : and the voice of we@@ eping shall be no more heard in her , nor the voice of crying .
and they shall build houses , and inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , and eat the fruit of them .
they shall not build , and another inhabit ; they shall not plant , and another eat : for as the days of a tree are the days of my people , and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands .
they shall not labour in vain , nor bring forth for trouble ; for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD , and their offspring with them .
and it shall come to pass , that before they call , I will answer ; and while they are yet speaking , I will hear .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , The heaven is my throne , and the earth is my foot@@ stool : where is the house that ye build unto me ? and where is the place of my rest ?
a voice of noise from the city , a voice from the temple , a voice of the LORD that ren@@ der@@ eth re@@ comp@@ ence to his enemies .
who hath heard such a thing ? who hath seen such things ? shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day ? or shall a nation be born at once ? for as soon as Z@@ ion tr@@ avail@@ ed , she brought forth her children .
shall I bring to the birth , and not cause to bring forth ? sa@@ ith the LORD : shall I cause to bring forth , and shut the womb ? sa@@ ith thy God .
rejoice ye with Jerusalem , and be glad with her , all ye that love her : rejoice for joy with her , all ye that mour@@ n for her :
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Be@@ hold , I will extend peace to her like a river , and the glory of the Genti@@ les like a flowing stream : then shall ye su@@ ck , ye shall be borne upon her sides , and be d@@ and@@ led upon her knees .
and when ye see this , your heart shall rejoice , and your bones shall flourish like an her@@ b : and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants , and his indignation toward his enemies .
for , behold , the LORD will come with fire , and with his ch@@ ari@@ ots like a whir@@ l@@ wind , to render his anger with fury , and his rebu@@ ke with flames of fire .
for by fire and by his sword will the LORD ple@@ ad with all flesh : and the sl@@ ain of the LORD shall be many .
they that sancti@@ fy themselves , and puri@@ fy themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst , eating swine 's flesh , and the ab@@ om@@ ination , and the mouse , shall be consumed together , sa@@ ith the LORD .
and they shall go forth , and look upon the car@@ cases of the men that have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me : for their worm shall not die , neither shall their fire be qu@@ en@@ ched ; and they shall be an ab@@ hor@@ ring unto all flesh .
the words of Jer@@ emi@@ ah the son of Hil@@ ki@@ ah , of the priests that were in An@@ ath@@ o@@ th in the land of Benjamin :
to whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Jo@@ si@@ ah the son of Am@@ on king of Jud@@ ah , in the thir@@ teenth year of his reign .
it came also in the days of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jo@@ si@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , unto the end of the eleventh year of Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the son of Jo@@ si@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month .
moreover the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , Jer@@ emi@@ ah , what se@@ est thou ? and I said , I see a rod of an al@@ mond tree .
and the word of the LORD came unto me the second time , saying , What se@@ est thou ? and I said , I see a see@@ thing pot ; and the face thereof is toward the north .
and I will utter my judgments against them touching all their w@@ ick@@ edness , who have for@@ s@@ aken me , and have burned inc@@ ense unto other gods , and wor@@ shipped the works of their own hands .
for , behold , I have made thee this day a def@@ enced city , and an iron pillar , and br@@ as@@ en walls against the whole land , against the kings of Jud@@ ah , against the princes thereof , against the priests thereof , and against the people of the land .
and they shall fight against thee ; but they shall not prevail against thee ; for I am with thee , sa@@ ith the LORD , to deliver thee .
Israel was hol@@ iness unto the LORD , and the fir@@ st@@ fruits of his increase : all that dev@@ our him shall offend ; evil shall come upon them , sa@@ ith the LORD .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , What ini@@ qu@@ ity have your fathers found in me , that they are gone far from me , and have walked after van@@ ity , and are become vain ?
for my people have committed two evils ; they have for@@ s@@ aken me the fountain of living waters , and he@@ wed them out ci@@ ster@@ ns , broken ci@@ ster@@ ns , that can hold no water .
and now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt , to drink the waters of Si@@ h@@ or ? or what hast thou to do in the way of As@@ sy@@ ria , to drink the waters of the river ?
th@@ ine own w@@ ick@@ edness shall correct thee , and thy back@@ sli@@ dings shall re@@ prove thee : know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter , that thou hast for@@ s@@ aken the LORD thy God , and that my fear is not in thee , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D of hosts .
yet I had planted thee a noble vine , wholly a right seed : how then art thou turned into the de@@ generate plant of a strange vine unto me ?
a wild ass used to the wilderness , that sn@@ u@@ ff@@ eth up the wind at her pleasure ; in her occasion who can turn her away ? all they that seek her will not weary themselves ; in her month they shall find her .
ye@@ a , thou shalt go forth from him , and th@@ ine hands upon th@@ ine head : for the LORD hath rejected thy confid@@ ences , and thou shalt not prosper in them .
lift up th@@ ine eyes unto the high places , and see where thou hast not been li@@ en with . in the ways hast thou sat for them , as the Arabian in the wilderness ; and thou hast polluted the land with thy wh@@ ore@@ doms and with thy w@@ ick@@ edness .
therefore the showers have been with@@ hol@@ den , and there hath been no latter rain ; and thou had@@ st a wh@@ ore 's forehead , thou ref@@ us@@ ed@@ st to be ashamed .
the LORD said also unto me in the days of Jo@@ si@@ ah the king , H@@ ast thou seen that which back@@ sliding Israel hath done ? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree , and there hath played the har@@ lot .
and I saw , when for all the causes whereby back@@ sliding Israel committed adul@@ tery I had put her away , and given her a bill of divorce ; yet her treach@@ erous sister Jud@@ ah feared not , but went and played the har@@ lot also .
go and proclaim these words toward the north , and say , Return , thou back@@ sliding Israel , sa@@ ith the LORD ; and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you : for I am mer@@ ciful , sa@@ ith the LORD , and I will not keep anger for ever .
only acknowledge th@@ ine ini@@ qu@@ ity , that thou hast trans@@ g@@ ressed against the LORD thy God , and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree , and ye have not obeyed my voice , sa@@ ith the LORD .
turn , O back@@ sliding children , sa@@ ith the LORD ; for I am married unto you : and I will take you one of a city , and two of a family , and I will bring you to Z@@ ion :
but I said , How shall I put thee among the children , and give thee a pleasant land , a goo@@ dly heritage of the hosts of nations ? and I said , Th@@ ou shalt call me , My father ; and shalt not turn away from me .
truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills , and from the multitude of mountains : truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel .
if thou wil@@ t return , O Israel , sa@@ ith the LORD , return unto me : and if thou wil@@ t put away th@@ ine ab@@ om@@ inations out of my sight , then shalt thou not remove .
and thou shalt swear , The LORD liv@@ eth , in truth , in judgment , and in righteousness ; and the nations shall bless themselves in him , and in him shall they glory .
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD to the men of Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem , Bre@@ ak up your f@@ allow ground , and sow not among thor@@ ns .
circum@@ c@@ ise yourselves to the LORD , and take away the fores@@ kins of your heart , ye men of Jud@@ ah and inhabitants of Jerusalem : lest my fury come forth like fire , and burn that none can qu@@ en@@ ch it , because of the evil of your do@@ ings .
declare ye in Jud@@ ah , and publish in Jerusalem ; and say , B@@ low ye the trum@@ pet in the land : cry , gather together , and say , assemble yourselves , and let us go into the def@@ enced cities .
set up the standard toward Z@@ ion : retire , stay not : for I will bring evil from the north , and a great destruction .
the lion is come up from his th@@ icket , and the destro@@ yer of the Genti@@ les is on his way ; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land des@@ ol@@ ate ; and thy cities shall be laid waste , without an inhabit@@ ant .
for this gir@@ d you with s@@ ack@@ cloth , lam@@ ent and how@@ l : for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us .
at that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem , A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people , not to fan , nor to clean@@ se ,
behold , he shall come up as clouds , and his ch@@ ari@@ ots shall be as a whir@@ l@@ wind : his horses are swif@@ ter than eag@@ les . w@@ oe unto us ! for we are spoiled .
as keepers of a field , are they against her round about ; because she hath been rebelli@@ ous against me , sa@@ ith the LORD .
thy way and thy do@@ ings have proc@@ ured these things unto thee ; this is thy w@@ ick@@ edness , because it is bitter , because it re@@ ach@@ eth unto th@@ ine heart .
my bow@@ els , my bow@@ els ! I am p@@ ained at my very heart ; my heart mak@@ eth a noise in me ; I C@@ AN@@ NOT hold my peace , because thou hast heard , O my soul , the sound of the trum@@ pet , the alarm of war .
destruction upon destruction is cried ; for the whole land is spoiled : suddenly are my tents spoiled , and my curtains in a moment .
for thus hath the LORD said , The whole land shall be des@@ ol@@ ate ; yet will I not make a full end .
for this shall the earth mour@@ n , and the heavens above be black : because I have spoken it , I have pur@@ posed it , and will not repent , neither will I turn back from it .
the whole city shall flee for the noise of the hor@@ sem@@ en and bow@@ men ; they shall go into th@@ ic@@ kets , and climb up upon the rocks : every city shall be for@@ s@@ aken , and not a man dwell therein .
W@@ herefore a lion out of the forest shall sl@@ ay them , and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them , a le@@ op@@ ard shall watch over their cities : every one that go@@ eth out th@@ ence shall be torn in pieces : because their trans@@ gres@@ sions are many , and their back@@ sli@@ dings are increased .
how shall I pardon thee for this ? thy children have for@@ s@@ aken me , and sworn by them that are no gods : when I had fed them to the full , they then committed adul@@ tery , and assembled themselves by troops in the har@@ lots ' houses .
they were as fed horses in the morning : every one neigh@@ ed after his neighbour 's wife .
go ye up upon her walls , and destroy ; but make not a full end : take away her batt@@ l@@ ements ; for they are not the LORD 's .
for the house of Israel and the house of Jud@@ ah have dealt very treach@@ er@@ ously against me , sa@@ ith the LORD .
and they shall eat up th@@ ine harvest , and thy bread , which thy sons and thy daughters should eat : they shall eat up thy f@@ locks and th@@ ine herds : they shall eat up thy v@@ ines and thy fi@@ g trees : they shall impover@@ ish thy f@@ enced cities , where@@ in thou trust@@ ed@@ st , with the sword .
neither say they in their heart , Let us now fear the LORD our God , that gi@@ v@@ eth rain , both the former and the latter , in his season : he reserv@@ eth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest .
for among my people are found wicked men : they lay wait , as he that sett@@ eth sn@@ ares ; they set a trap , they catch men .
as a cage is full of birds , so are their houses full of dece@@ it : therefore they are become great , and wa@@ x@@ en rich .
the prophets proph@@ esy fal@@ sely , and the priests bear rule by their means ; and my people love to have it so : and what will ye do in the end thereof ?
to whom shall I speak , and give warning , that they may hear ? behold , their ear is un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , and they C@@ AN@@ NOT hear@@ ken : behold , the word of the LORD is unto them a repro@@ ach ; they have no delight in it .
and their houses shall be turned unto others , with their fields and wives together : for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land , sa@@ ith the LORD .
they have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly , saying , Peace , peace ; when there is no peace .
were they ashamed when they had committed ab@@ om@@ ination ? n@@ ay , they were not at all ashamed , neither could they bl@@ ush : therefore they shall fall among them that fall : at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down , sa@@ ith the LORD .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Stand ye in the ways , and see , and ask for the old paths , where is the good way , and walk therein , and ye shall find rest for your souls . but they said , We will not walk therein .
hear , O earth : behold , I will bring evil upon this people , even the fruit of their thoughts , because they have not hear@@ k@@ ened unto my words , nor to my law , but rejected it .
to what purpose com@@ eth there to me inc@@ ense from She@@ ba , and the sweet cane from a far country ? your burnt offerings are not acceptable , nor your sacrifices sweet unto me .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Be@@ hold , a people com@@ eth from the north country , and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth .
they shall lay hold on bow and spe@@ ar ; they are cruel , and have no mercy ; their voice ro@@ areth like the sea ; and they ride upon horses , set in array as men for war against thee , O daughter of Z@@ ion .
we have heard the fame thereof : our hands wax fee@@ ble : angu@@ ish hath taken hold of us , and pain , as of a woman in trav@@ ail .
go not forth into the field , nor walk by the way ; for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side .
O daughter of my people , gir@@ d thee with s@@ ack@@ cloth , and wal@@ low thy@@ self in ashes : make thee mourning , as for an only son , most bitter lam@@ entation : for the spo@@ iler shall suddenly come upon us .
the bel@@ lows are burned , the lead is consumed of the fire ; the founder mel@@ t@@ eth in vain : for the wicked are not pl@@ ucked away .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel , Am@@ end your ways and your do@@ ings , and I will cause you to dwell in this place .
is this house , which is called by my name , become a den of rob@@ bers in your eyes ? behold , even I have seen it , sa@@ ith the LORD .
but go ye now unto my place which was in Sh@@ il@@ oh , where I set my name at the first , and see what I did to it for the w@@ ick@@ edness of my people Israel .
and now , because ye have done all these works , sa@@ ith the LORD , and I sp@@ ake unto you , rising up early and speaking , but ye heard not ; and I called you , but ye answered not ;
do they provoke me to anger ? sa@@ ith the LORD : do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces ?
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; P@@ ut your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices , and eat flesh .
but this thing commanded I them , saying , obey my voice , and I will be your God , and ye shall be my people : and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you , that it may be well unto you .
therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them ; but they will not hear@@ ken to thee : thou shalt also call unto them ; but they will not answer thee .
but thou shalt say unto them , This is a nation that obey@@ eth not the voice of the LORD their God , nor recei@@ v@@ eth correction : truth is perished , and is cut off from their mouth .
for the children of Jud@@ ah have done evil in my sight , sa@@ ith the LORD : they have set their ab@@ om@@ inations in the house which is called by my name , to poll@@ ute it .
and they have built the high places of T@@ oph@@ et , which is in the valley of the son of H@@ inno@@ m , to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire ; which I commanded them not , neither came it into my heart .
therefore , behold , the days come , sa@@ ith the LORD , that it shall no more be called T@@ oph@@ et , nor the valley of the son of H@@ inno@@ m , but the valley of slaughter : for they shall bury in T@@ oph@@ et , till there be no place .
and death shall be chosen rather than life by all the resi@@ due of them that remain of this evil family , which remain in all the places whi@@ ther I have driven them , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
moreover thou shalt say unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD ; Sh@@ all they fall , and not arise ? shall he turn away , and not return ?
ye@@ a , the stor@@ k in the heaven know@@ eth her appointed times ; and the tur@@ tle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming ; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD .
how do ye say , We are wise , and the law of the LORD is with us ? lo , certainly in vain made he it ; the pen of the scri@@ bes is in vain .
the wise men are ashamed , they are dis@@ may@@ ed and taken : lo , they have rejected the word of the LORD ; and what wisdom is in them ?
therefore will I give their wives unto others , and their fields to them that shall inherit them : for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to co@@ vet@@ ousness , from the prophet even unto the priest every one deal@@ eth fal@@ sely .
were they ashamed when they had committed ab@@ om@@ ination ? n@@ ay , they were not at all ashamed , neither could they bl@@ ush : therefore shall they fall among them that fall : in the time of their vis@@ itation they shall be cast down , sa@@ ith the LORD .
I will surely consume them , sa@@ ith the LORD : there shall be no grapes on the vine , nor fi@@ gs on the fi@@ g tree , and the leaf shall fade ; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them .
is there no bal@@ m in Gil@@ e@@ ad ; is there no physician there ? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered ?
Oh that my head were waters , and mine eyes a fountain of tears , that I might we@@ ep day and night for the sl@@ ain of the daughter of my people !
Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of way@@ far@@ ing men ; that I might leave my people , and go from them ! for they be all adul@@ ter@@ ers , an assembly of treach@@ erous men .
and they bend their tongues like their bow for lies : but they are not val@@ i@@ ant for the truth upon the earth ; for they proceed from evil to evil , and they know not me , sa@@ ith the LORD .
th@@ ine hab@@ itation is in the midst of dece@@ it ; through dece@@ it they refuse to know me , sa@@ ith the LORD .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , Be@@ hold , I will melt them , and try them ; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people ?
their tongue is as an arrow shot out ; it spe@@ ak@@ eth dece@@ it : one spe@@ ak@@ eth peace@@ ably to his neighbour with his mouth , but in heart he lay@@ eth his wait .
and I will make Jerusalem he@@ aps , and a den of dragons ; and I will make the cities of Jud@@ ah des@@ ol@@ ate , without an inhabit@@ ant .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Be@@ hold , I will feed them , even this people , with wor@@ m@@ wood , and give them water of g@@ all to drink .
I will sc@@ atter them also among the he@@ a@@ then , whom neither they nor their fathers have known : and I will send a sword after them , till I have consumed them .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , Con@@ sider ye , and call for the mourning women , that they may come ; and send for cunning women , that they may come :
and let them make ha@@ ste , and take up a w@@ ailing for us , that our eyes may run down with tears , and our ey@@ eli@@ ds g@@ ush out with waters .
for a voice of w@@ ailing is heard out of Z@@ ion , How are we spoiled ! we are greatly conf@@ ounded , because we have for@@ s@@ aken the land , because our dwell@@ ings have cast us out .
yet hear the word of the LORD , O ye women , and let your ear receive the word of his mouth , and teach your daughters w@@ ailing , and every one her neighbour lam@@ entation .
for death is come up into our windows , and is entered into our palaces , to cut off the children from without , and the young men from the streets .
speak , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , Even the car@@ cases of men shall fall as d@@ ung upon the open field , and as the handful after the har@@ vest@@ man , and none shall gather them .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom , neither let the mighty man glory in his might , let not the rich man glory in his riches :
but let him that glori@@ eth glory in this , that he understand@@ eth and know@@ eth me , that I am the LORD which exercise lov@@ ing@@ kindness , judgment , and righteousness , in the earth : for in these things I delight , sa@@ ith the LORD .
behold , the days come , sa@@ ith the LORD , that I will punish all them which are circum@@ c@@ ised with the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised ;
Egypt , and Jud@@ ah , and E@@ dom , and the children of Am@@ mon , and Mo@@ ab , and all that are in the utmost corners , that dwell in the wilderness : for all these nations are un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , and all the house of Israel are un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised in the heart .
they are upright as the palm tree , but speak not : they must needs be borne , because they C@@ AN@@ NOT go . be not afraid of them ; for they C@@ AN@@ NOT do evil , neither also is it in them to do good .
who would not fear thee , O King of nations ? for to thee do@@ th it ap@@ per@@ tain : for@@ as@@ much as among all the wise men of the nations , and in all their king@@ doms , there is none like unto thee .
silver spread into plates is brought from Tar@@ sh@@ ish , and gold from Up@@ haz , the work of the work@@ man , and of the hands of the founder : blue and purple is their clothing : they are all the work of cunning men .
but the LORD is the true God , he is the living God , and an everlasting king : at his wrath the earth shall trem@@ ble , and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation .
every man is bru@@ tish in his knowledge : every founder is conf@@ ounded by the gra@@ ven image : for his mol@@ ten image is false@@ hood , and there is no breath in them .
they are van@@ ity , and the work of errors : in the time of their vis@@ itation they shall perish .
the portion of Jacob is not like them : for he is the former of all things ; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance : the LORD of hosts is his name .
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Be@@ hold , I will s@@ ling out the inhabitants of the land at this once , and will distress them , that they may find it so .
my tab@@ ern@@ acle is spoiled , and all my cor@@ ds are broken : my children are gone forth of me , and they are not : there is none to stretch forth my tent any more , and to set up my curtains .
pour out thy fury upon the he@@ a@@ then that know thee not , and upon the families that call not on thy name : for they have eaten up Jacob , and dev@@ oured him , and consumed him , and have made his hab@@ itation des@@ ol@@ ate .
and say thou unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD God of Israel ; Cur@@ sed be the man that obey@@ eth not the words of this covenant ,
which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , from the iron furnace , saying , obey my voice , and do them , according to all which I command you : so shall ye be my people , and I will be your God :
that I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers , to give them a land flowing with milk and honey , as it is this day . then answered I , and said , So be it , O LORD .
then the LORD said unto me , proclaim all these words in the cities of Jud@@ ah , and in the streets of Jerusalem , saying , He@@ ar ye the words of this covenant , and do them .
they are turned back to the ini@@ qu@@ ities of their fore@@ fathers , which refused to hear my words ; and they went after other gods to serve them : the house of Israel and the house of Jud@@ ah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Be@@ hold , I will bring evil upon them , which they shall not be able to escape ; and though they shall cry unto me , I will not hear@@ ken unto them .
then shall the cities of Jud@@ ah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go , and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer inc@@ ense : but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble .
for according to the number of thy cities were thy gods , O Jud@@ ah ; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up al@@ t@@ ars to that shameful thing , even al@@ t@@ ars to burn inc@@ ense unto Ba@@ al .
what hath my beloved to do in mine house , seeing she hath wrought le@@ w@@ dness with many , and the holy flesh is passed from thee ? when thou do@@ est evil , then thou rejo@@ ic@@ est .
the LORD called thy name , A green olive tree , fair , and of goo@@ dly fruit : with the noise of a great tum@@ ult he hath kind@@ led fire upon it , and the branches of it are broken .
for the LORD of hosts , that planted thee , hath pronounced evil against thee , for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Jud@@ ah , which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering inc@@ ense unto Ba@@ al .
but , O LORD of hosts , that jud@@ gest righte@@ ously , that tri@@ est the re@@ ins and the heart , let me see thy vengeance on them : for unto thee have I revealed my cause .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , Be@@ hold , I will punish them : the young men shall die by the sword ; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine :
and there shall be no remn@@ ant of them : for I will bring evil upon the men of An@@ ath@@ o@@ th , even the year of their vis@@ itation .
righteous art thou , O LORD , when I ple@@ ad with thee : yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments : W@@ herefore do@@ th the way of the wicked prosper ? W@@ herefore are all they happy that deal very treach@@ er@@ ously ?
thou hast planted them , ye@@ a , they have taken root : they grow , ye@@ a , they bring forth fruit : thou art near in their mouth , and far from their re@@ ins .
if thou hast run with the foot@@ men , and they have wear@@ ied thee , then how can@@ st thou contend with horses ? and if in the land of peace , where@@ in thou trust@@ ed@@ st , they wear@@ ied thee , then how wil@@ t thou do in the swelling of Jordan ?
for even thy brethren , and the house of thy father , even they have dealt treach@@ er@@ ously with thee ; ye@@ a , they have called a multitude after thee : believe them not , though they speak fair words unto thee .
I have for@@ s@@ aken mine house , I have left mine heritage ; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies .
many past@@ ors have destroyed my viney@@ ard , they have tro@@ dden my portion under foot , they have made my pleasant portion a des@@ ol@@ ate wilderness .
they have s@@ own wheat , but shall reap thor@@ ns : they have put themselves to pain , but shall not profit : and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours , that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit ; Be@@ hold , I will pl@@ uck them out of their land , and pl@@ uck out the house of Jud@@ ah from among them .
take the gir@@ dle that thou hast got , which is upon thy lo@@ ins , and arise , go to E@@ uph@@ rates , and hide it there in a hole of the rock .
and it came to pass after many days , that the LORD said unto me , A@@ rise , go to E@@ uph@@ rates , and take the gir@@ dle from th@@ ence , which I commanded thee to hide there .
therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word ; Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD God of Israel , Every bottle shall be filled with wine : and they shall say unto thee , Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine ?
and I will d@@ ash them one against another , even the fathers and the sons together , sa@@ ith the LORD : I will not pity , nor spare , nor have mercy , but destroy them .
what wil@@ t thou say when he shall punish thee ? for thou hast taught them to be cap@@ tains , and as chief over thee : shall not sor@@ rows take thee , as a woman in trav@@ ail ?
I have seen th@@ ine adul@@ ter@@ ies , and thy neigh@@ ings , the le@@ w@@ dness of thy wh@@ ore@@ dom , and th@@ ine ab@@ om@@ inations on the hills in the fields . w@@ oe unto thee , O Jerusalem ! wil@@ t thou not be made clean ? when shall it once be ?
Jud@@ ah mour@@ neth , and the gates thereof langu@@ ish ; they are black unto the ground ; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up .
and their no@@ bles have sent their little ones to the waters : they came to the pits , and found no water ; they returned with their vessels empty ; they were ashamed and conf@@ ounded , and covered their heads .
and the wild asses did stand in the high places , they sn@@ u@@ ffed up the wind like dragons ; their eyes did fail , because there was no grass .
O the hope of Israel , the s@@ avi@@ our thereof in time of trouble , why shoul@@ dest thou be as a stranger in the land , and as a way@@ far@@ ing man that tur@@ neth aside to tar@@ ry for a night ?
why shoul@@ dest thou be as a man aston@@ ied , as a mighty man that C@@ AN@@ NOT save ? yet thou , O LORD , art in the midst of us , and we are called by thy name ; leave us not .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD unto this people , Th@@ us have they loved to wander , they have not ref@@ rained their feet , therefore the LORD do@@ th not accept them ; he will now remember their ini@@ qu@@ ity , and visit their sins .
when they fast , I will not hear their cry ; and when they offer burnt offering and an ob@@ lation , I will not accept them : but I will consume them by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pesti@@ l@@ ence .
then said I , Ah , Lord GO@@ D ! behold , the prophets say unto them , Y@@ e shall not see the sword , neither shall ye have famine ; but I will give you assured peace in this place .
therefore thou shalt say this word unto them ; Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day , and let them not cease : for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach , with a very griev@@ ous blow .
hast thou utterly rejected Jud@@ ah ? hath thy soul lo@@ thed Z@@ ion ? why hast thou sm@@ it@@ ten us , and there is no healing for us ? we looked for peace , and there is no good ; and for the time of healing , and behold trouble !
we acknowledge , O LORD , our w@@ ick@@ edness , and the ini@@ qu@@ ity of our fathers : for we have sin@@ ned against thee .
do not abh@@ or us , for thy name 's sake , do not dis@@ grace the throne of thy glory : remember , break not thy covenant with us .
are there any among the van@@ ities of the Genti@@ les that can cause rain ? or can the heavens give showers ? art not thou he , O LORD our God ? therefore we will wait upon thee : for thou hast made all these things .
and I will appoint over them four kinds , sa@@ ith the LORD : the sword to sl@@ ay , and the dogs to tear , and the f@@ ow@@ ls of the heaven , and the beasts of the earth , to dev@@ our and destroy .
and I will cause them to be removed into all king@@ doms of the earth , because of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h the son of He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , for that which he did in Jerusalem .
thou hast for@@ s@@ aken me , sa@@ ith the LORD , thou art gone backward : therefore will I stretch out my hand against thee , and destroy thee ; I am weary with rep@@ enting .
and I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land ; I will ber@@ e@@ ave them of children , I will destroy my people , since they return not from their ways .
she that hath borne seven langu@@ ish@@ eth : she hath given up the ghost ; her sun is gone down while it was yet day : she hath been ashamed and conf@@ ounded : and the resi@@ due of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies , sa@@ ith the LORD .
w@@ oe is me , my mother , that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth ! I have neither lent on us@@ ury , nor men have lent to me on us@@ ury ; yet every one of them do@@ th curse me .
the LORD said , Ver@@ ily it shall be well with thy remn@@ ant ; verily I will cause the enemy to entre@@ at thee well in the time of evil and in the time of afflic@@ tion .
thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price , and that for all thy sins , even in all thy borders .
and I will make thee to pass with th@@ ine enemies into a land which thou know@@ est not : for a fire is kind@@ led in mine anger , which shall burn upon you .
and I will make thee unto this people a f@@ enced br@@ as@@ en wall : and they shall fight against thee , but they shall not prevail against thee : for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee , sa@@ ith the LORD .
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Enter not into the house of mourning , neither go to lam@@ ent nor b@@ emo@@ an them : for I have taken away my peace from this people , sa@@ ith the LORD , even lov@@ ing@@ kindness and mer@@ cies .
both the great and the small shall die in this land : they shall not be buried , neither shall men lam@@ ent for them , nor cut themselves , nor make themselves bal@@ d for them :
then shalt thou say unto them , Because your fathers have for@@ s@@ aken me , sa@@ ith the LORD , and have walked after other gods , and have served them , and have wor@@ shipped them , and have for@@ s@@ aken me , and have not kept my law ;
therefore , behold , the days come , sa@@ ith the LORD , that it shall no more be said , The LORD liv@@ eth , that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
but , The LORD liv@@ eth , that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north , and from all the lands whi@@ ther he had driven them : and I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers .
behold , I will send for many f@@ ish@@ ers , sa@@ ith the LORD , and they shall fish them ; and after will I send for many hunters , and they shall hunt them from every mountain , and from every hill , and out of the holes of the rocks .
O LORD , my strength , and my fortress , and my refuge in the day of afflic@@ tion , the Genti@@ les shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth , and shall say , Su@@ rely our fathers have inherited lies , van@@ ity , and things where@@ in there is no profit .
therefore , behold , I will this once cause them to know , I will cause them to know mine hand and my might ; and they shall know that my name is The LORD .
for he shall be like the he@@ ath in the desert , and shall not see when good com@@ eth ; but shall inhabit the par@@ ched places in the wilderness , in a salt land and not inhabited .
I the LORD search the heart , I try the re@@ ins , even to give every man according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his do@@ ings .
as the par@@ tri@@ dge sit@@ t@@ eth on eggs , and hat@@ ch@@ eth them not ; so he that get@@ t@@ eth riches , and not by right , shall leave them in the midst of his days , and at his end shall be a fool .
O LORD , the hope of Israel , all that for@@ sake thee shall be ashamed , and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth , because they have for@@ s@@ aken the LORD , the fountain of living waters .
heal me , O LORD , and I shall be healed ; save me , and I shall be saved : for thou art my praise .
as for me , I have not ha@@ st@@ ened from being a pastor to follow thee : neither have I desired the wo@@ eful day ; thou know@@ est : that which came out of my lips was right before thee .
let them be conf@@ ounded that persec@@ ute me , but let not me be conf@@ ounded : let them be dis@@ may@@ ed , but let not me be dis@@ may@@ ed : bring upon them the day of evil , and destroy them with double destruction .
and say unto them , He@@ ar ye the word of the LORD , ye kings of Jud@@ ah , and all Jud@@ ah , and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , that enter in by these gates :
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; Take heed to yourselves , and bear no burden on the sab@@ bath day , nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem ;
and it shall come to pass , if ye dilig@@ ently hear@@ ken unto me , sa@@ ith the LORD , to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sab@@ bath day , but hal@@ low the sab@@ bath day , to do no work therein ;
then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David , riding in ch@@ ari@@ ots and on horses , they , and their princes , the men of Jud@@ ah , and the inhabitants of Jerusalem : and this city shall remain for ever .
but if ye will not hear@@ ken unto me to hal@@ low the sab@@ bath day , and not to bear a burden , even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sab@@ bath day ; then will I kind@@ le a fire in the gates thereof , and it shall dev@@ our the palaces of Jerusalem , and it shall not be qu@@ en@@ ched .
arise , and go down to the pot@@ ter 's house , and there I will cause thee to hear my words .
and the vessel that he made of clay was mar@@ red in the hand of the pot@@ ter : so he made it again another vessel , as seemed good to the pot@@ ter to make it .
O house of Israel , C@@ AN@@ NOT I do with you as this pot@@ ter ? sa@@ ith the LORD . behold , as the clay is in the pot@@ ter 's hand , so are ye in mine hand , O house of Israel .
and at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a kingdom , to build and to plant it ;
if it do evil in my sight , that it obey not my voice , then I will repent of the good , where@@ with I said I would benefit them .
and they said , There is no hope : but we will walk after our own devices , and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; As@@ k ye now among the he@@ a@@ then , who hath heard such things : the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing .
I will sc@@ atter them as with an east wind before the enemy ; I will sh@@ ew them the back , and not the face , in the day of their calamity .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Go and get a pot@@ ter 's ear@@ then bottle , and take of the anci@@ ents of the people , and of the anci@@ ents of the priests ;
because they have for@@ s@@ aken me , and have e@@ strang@@ ed this place , and have burned inc@@ ense in it unto other gods , whom neither they nor their fathers have known , nor the kings of Jud@@ ah , and have filled this place with the blood of inno@@ cents ;
they have built also the high places of Ba@@ al , to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Ba@@ al , which I commanded not , nor sp@@ ake it , neither came it into my mind :
therefore , behold , the days come , sa@@ ith the LORD , that this place shall no more be called T@@ oph@@ et , nor The valley of the son of H@@ inno@@ m , but The valley of slaughter .
and I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters , and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and stra@@ it@@ ness , where@@ with their enemies , and they that seek their lives , shall stra@@ it@@ en them .
thus will I do unto this place , sa@@ ith the LORD , and to the inhabitants thereof , and even make this city as T@@ oph@@ et :
then came Jer@@ emi@@ ah from T@@ oph@@ et , whi@@ ther the LORD had sent him to proph@@ esy ; and he stood in the court of the LORD 's house ; and said to all the people ,
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Be@@ hold , I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it , because they have hardened their nec@@ ks , that they might not hear my words .
and it came to pass on the mor@@ row , that Pash@@ ur brought forth Jer@@ emi@@ ah out of the stocks . then said Jer@@ emi@@ ah unto him , The LORD hath not called thy name Pash@@ ur , but Mag@@ or @@@ -@@ @ miss@@ ab@@ ib .
and thou , Pash@@ ur , and all that dwell in th@@ ine house shall go into cap@@ tivity : and thou shalt come to Babylon , and there thou shalt die , and shalt be buried there , thou , and all thy friends , to whom thou hast prophe@@ si@@ ed lies .
but the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one : therefore my persec@@ utors shall stum@@ ble , and they shall not prevail : they shall be greatly ashamed ; for they shall not prosper : their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten .
but , O LORD of hosts , that tri@@ est the righteous , and se@@ est the re@@ ins and the heart , let me see thy vengeance on them : for unto thee have I opened my cause .
and let that man be as the cities which the LORD over@@ threw , and rep@@ ented not : and let him hear the cry in the morning , and the shouting at no@@ on@@ tide ;
and I myself will fight against you with an out@@ stretched hand and with a strong arm , even in anger , and in fury , and in great wrath .
and unto this people thou shalt say , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD ; Be@@ hold , I set before you the way of life , and the way of death .
he that ab@@ id@@ eth in this city shall die by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pesti@@ l@@ ence : but he that go@@ eth out , and fall@@ eth to the Chal@@ de@@ ans that be@@ siege you , he shall live , and his life shall be unto him for a prey .
for I have set my face against this city for evil , and not for good , sa@@ ith the LORD : it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire .
and say , He@@ ar the word of the LORD , O king of Jud@@ ah , that sit@@ test upon the throne of David , thou , and thy servants , and thy people that enter in by these gates :
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; Exec@@ ute ye judgment and righteousness , and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the op@@ pres@@ sor : and do no wrong , do no violence to the stranger , the fa@@ ther@@ less , nor the widow , neither shed innocent blood in this place .
for if ye do this thing indeed , then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David , riding in ch@@ ari@@ ots and on horses , he , and his servants , and his people .
but if ye will not hear these words , I swear by myself , sa@@ ith the LORD , that this house shall become a des@@ ol@@ ation .
and I will prepare destroyers against thee , every one with his weapons : and they shall cut down thy choice c@@ ed@@ ars , and cast them into the fire .
and many nations shall pass by this city , and they shall say every man to his neighbour , W@@ herefore hath the LORD done thus unto this great city ?
w@@ oe unto him that buil@@ det@@ h his house by un@@ righteousness , and his chambers by wrong ; that us@@ eth his neighbour 's service without wages , and gi@@ v@@ eth him not for his work ;
he judged the cause of the poor and ne@@ edy ; then it was well with him : was not this to know me ? sa@@ ith the LORD .
but th@@ ine eyes and th@@ ine heart are not but for thy co@@ vet@@ ousness , and for to shed innocent blood , and for oppression , and for violence , to do it .
he shall be buried with the burial of an ass , drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem .
go up to Lebanon , and cry ; and lift up thy voice in Bash@@ an , and cry from the passages : for all thy lovers are destroyed .
O inhabit@@ ant of Lebanon , that mak@@ est thy nest in the c@@ ed@@ ars , how gr@@ acious shalt thou be when p@@ ang@@ s come upon thee , the pain as of a woman in trav@@ ail !
and I will cast thee out , and thy mother that bare thee , into another country , where ye were not born ; and there shall ye die .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , Write ye this man chil@@ dless , a man that shall not prosper in his days : for no man of his seed shall prosper , sitting upon the throne of David , and ruling any more in Jud@@ ah .
and I will gather the remn@@ ant of my flock out of all countries whi@@ ther I have driven them , and will bring them again to their fol@@ ds ; and they shall be fruitful and increase .
and I will set up shep@@ herds over them which shall feed them : and they shall fear no more , nor be dis@@ may@@ ed , neither shall they be lacking , sa@@ ith the LORD .
behold , the days come , sa@@ ith the LORD , that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch , and a King shall reign and prosper , and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth .
therefore , behold , the days come , sa@@ ith the LORD , that they shall no more say , The LORD liv@@ eth , which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ;
but , The LORD liv@@ eth , which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country , and from all countries whi@@ ther I had driven them ; and they shall dwell in their own land .
mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets ; all my bones shake ; I am like a drun@@ ken man , and like a man whom wine hath overcome , because of the LORD , and because of the words of his hol@@ iness .
for the land is full of adul@@ ter@@ ers ; for because of sw@@ earing the land mour@@ neth ; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up , and their course is evil , and their force is not right .
W@@ herefore their way shall be unto them as slip@@ per@@ y ways in the darkness : they shall be driven on , and fall therein : for I will bring evil upon them , even the year of their vis@@ itation , sa@@ ith the LORD .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets ; Be@@ hold , I will feed them with wor@@ m@@ wood , and make them drink the water of g@@ all : for from the prophets of Jerusalem is prof@@ an@@ eness gone forth into all the land .
they say still unto them that desp@@ ise me , The LORD hath said , Y@@ e shall have peace ; and they say unto every one that wal@@ ket@@ h after the imagination of his own heart , No evil shall come upon you .
for who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD , and hath perceived and heard his word ? who hath marked his word , and heard it ?
the anger of the LORD shall not return , until he have executed , and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart : in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly .
but if they had stood in my counsel , and had caused my people to hear my words , then they should have turned them from their evil way , and from the evil of their do@@ ings .
and when this people , or the prophet , or a priest , shall ask thee , saying , What is the burden of the LORD ? thou shalt then say unto them , What burden ? I will even for@@ sake you , sa@@ ith the LORD .
and as for the prophet , and the priest , and the people , that shall say , The burden of the LORD , I will even punish that man and his house .
thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour , and every one to his brother , What hath the LORD answered ? and , What hath the LORD spoken ?
and the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more : for every man 's word shall be his burden ; for ye have perver@@ ted the words of the living God , of the LORD of hosts our God .
therefore , behold , I , even I , will utterly forget you , and I will for@@ sake you , and the city that I gave you and your fathers , and cast you out of my presence :
one basket had very good fi@@ gs , even like the fi@@ gs that are first ripe : and the other basket had very n@@ au@@ ghty fi@@ gs , which could not be eaten , they were so bad .
for I will set mine eyes upon them for good , and I will bring them again to this land : and I will build them , and not pull them down ; and I will plant them , and not pl@@ uck them up .
and I will give them an heart to know me , that I am the LORD : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God : for they shall return unto me with their whole heart .
and I will deliver them to be removed into all the king@@ doms of the earth for their hurt , to be a repro@@ ach and a prover@@ b , a ta@@ unt and a curse , in all places whi@@ ther I shall drive them .
and I will send the sword , the famine , and the pesti@@ l@@ ence , among them , till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers .
the which Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet sp@@ ake unto all the people of Jud@@ ah , and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , saying ,
from the thir@@ teenth year of Jo@@ si@@ ah the son of Am@@ on king of Jud@@ ah , even unto this day , that is the three and twentieth year , the word of the LORD hath come unto me , and I have spoken unto you , rising early and speaking ; but ye have not hear@@ k@@ ened .
they said , Turn ye again now every one from his evil way , and from the evil of your do@@ ings , and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever :
and go not after other gods to serve them , and to worship them , and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands ; and I will do you no hurt .
and this whole land shall be a des@@ ol@@ ation , and an aston@@ ishment ; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years .
and I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it , even all that is written in this book , which Jer@@ emi@@ ah hath prophe@@ si@@ ed against all the nations .
for many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also : and I will re@@ comp@@ ense them according to their deeds , and according to the works of their own hands .
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD God of Israel unto me ; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand , and cause all the nations , to whom I send thee , to drink it .
then took I the cup at the LORD 's hand , and made all the nations to drink , unto whom the LORD had sent me :
and all the ming@@ led people , and all the kings of the land of U@@ z , and all the kings of the land of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and Ash@@ kel@@ on , and A@@ zz@@ ah , and Ek@@ ron , and the remn@@ ant of Ash@@ do@@ d ,
and all the kings of Ty@@ rus , and all the kings of Z@@ id@@ on , and the kings of the is@@ les which are beyond the sea ,
and all the kings of Arabia , and all the kings of the ming@@ led people that dwell in the desert ,
and all the kings of the north , far and near , one with another , and all the king@@ doms of the world , which are upon the face of the earth : and the king of Sh@@ esh@@ ach shall drink after them .
therefore thou shalt say unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Dr@@ ink ye , and be drun@@ ken , and sp@@ ue , and fall , and rise no more , because of the sword which I will send among you .
and it shall be , if they refuse to take the cup at th@@ ine hand to drink , then shalt thou say unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts ; Y@@ e shall certainly drink .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , Be@@ hold , evil shall go forth from nation to nation , and a great whir@@ l@@ wind shall be raised up from the co@@ asts of the earth .
how@@ l , ye shep@@ herds , and cry ; and wal@@ low yourselves in the ashes , ye principal of the flock : for the days of your slaughter and of your disper@@ sions are accomplished ; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel .
he hath for@@ s@@ aken his covert , as the lion : for their land is des@@ ol@@ ate because of the fierc@@ eness of the op@@ pres@@ sor , and because of his fierce anger .
in the beginning of the reign of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jo@@ si@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah came this word from the LORD , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; Stand in the court of the LORD 's house , and speak unto all the cities of Jud@@ ah , which come to worship in the LORD 's house , all the words that I command thee to speak unto them ; diminish not a word :
if so be they will hear@@ ken , and turn every man from his evil way , that I may repent me of the evil , which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their do@@ ings .
and thou shalt say unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD ; If ye will not hear@@ ken to me , to walk in my law , which I have set before you ,
to hear@@ ken to the words of my servants the prophets , whom I sent unto you , both rising up early , and sending them , but ye have not hear@@ k@@ ened ;
now it came to pass , when Jer@@ emi@@ ah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak unto all the people , that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him , saying , Th@@ ou shalt surely die .
why hast thou prophe@@ si@@ ed in the name of the LORD , saying , This house shall be like Sh@@ il@@ oh , and this city shall be des@@ ol@@ ate without an inhabit@@ ant ? and all the people were gathered against Jer@@ emi@@ ah in the house of the LORD .
then sp@@ ake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people , saying , This man is worthy to die ; for he hath prophe@@ si@@ ed against this city , as ye have heard with your ears .
then sp@@ ake Jer@@ emi@@ ah unto all the princes and to all the people , saying , The LORD sent me to proph@@ esy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard .
therefore now amend your ways and your do@@ ings , and obey the voice of the LORD your God ; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you .
but know ye for certain , that if ye put me to death , ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves , and upon this city , and upon the inhabitants thereof : for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears .
then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets ; This man is not worthy to die : for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God .
Mic@@ ah the Mor@@ asth@@ ite prophe@@ si@@ ed in the days of He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , and sp@@ ake to all the people of Jud@@ ah , saying , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts ; Z@@ ion shall be pl@@ owed like a field , and Jerusalem shall become he@@ aps , and the mountains of the house as the high places of a forest .
and there was also a man that prophe@@ si@@ ed in the name of the LORD , Uri@@ jah the son of Sh@@ em@@ aiah of Kir@@ j@@ ath @@@ -@@ @ j@@ ear@@ im , who prophe@@ si@@ ed against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jer@@ emi@@ ah :
and when Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king , with all his mighty men , and all the princes , heard his words , the king sought to put him to death : but when Uri@@ jah heard it , he was afraid , and fled , and went into Egypt ;
and they fetched forth Uri@@ jah out of Egypt , and brought him unto Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the king ; who sle@@ w him with the sword , and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people .
nevertheless the hand of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an was with Jer@@ emi@@ ah , that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death .
in the beginning of the reign of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jo@@ si@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah came this word unto Jer@@ emi@@ ah from the LORD , saying ,
and send them to the king of E@@ dom , and to the king of Mo@@ ab , and to the king of the Am@@ mon@@ ites , and to the king of Ty@@ rus , and to the king of Z@@ id@@ on , by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah ;
and command them to say unto their masters , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Th@@ us shall ye say unto your masters ;
I have made the earth , the man and the beast that are upon the ground , by my great power and by my out@@ stretched arm , and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me .
and now have I given all these lands unto the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king of Babylon , my servant ; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him .
therefore hear@@ ken not ye to your prophets , nor to your div@@ in@@ ers , nor to your dream@@ ers , nor to your enchan@@ ters , nor to your sorcer@@ ers , which speak unto you , saying , Y@@ e shall not serve the king of Babylon :
for they proph@@ esy a lie unto you , to remove you far from your land ; and that I should drive you out , and ye should perish .
but the nations that bring their neck under the y@@ oke of the king of Babylon , and serve him , those will I let remain still in their own land , sa@@ ith the LORD ; and they shall till it , and dwell therein .
I sp@@ ake also to Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah according to all these words , saying , B@@ ring your nec@@ ks under the y@@ oke of the king of Babylon , and serve him and his people , and live .
why will ye die , thou and thy people , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pesti@@ l@@ ence , as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon ?
therefore hear@@ ken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you , saying , Y@@ e shall not serve the king of Babylon : for they proph@@ esy a lie unto you .
for I have not sent them , sa@@ ith the LORD , yet they proph@@ esy a lie in my name ; that I might drive you out , and that ye might perish , ye , and the prophets that proph@@ esy unto you .
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars , and concerning the sea , and concerning the bases , and concerning the resi@@ due of the vessels that remain in this city ,
they shall be carried to Babylon , and there shall they be until the day that I visit them , sa@@ ith the LORD ; then will I bring them up , and restore them to this place .
within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD 's house , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon took away from this place , and carried them to Babylon :
and I will bring again to this place J@@ econ@@ i@@ ah the son of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im king of Jud@@ ah , with all the cap@@ tives of Jud@@ ah , that went into Babylon , sa@@ ith the LORD : for I will break the y@@ oke of the king of Babylon .
nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in th@@ ine ears , and in the ears of all the people ;
the prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophe@@ si@@ ed both against many countries , and against great king@@ doms , of war , and of evil , and of pesti@@ l@@ ence .
the prophet which prophe@@ si@@ eth of peace , when the word of the prophet shall come to pass , then shall the prophet be known , that the LORD hath truly sent him .
then Han@@ ani@@ ah the prophet took the y@@ oke from off the prophet Jer@@ emi@@ ah 's neck , and brake it .
go and tell Han@@ ani@@ ah , saying , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD ; Th@@ ou hast broken the y@@ okes of wood ; but thou shalt make for them y@@ okes of iron .
then said the prophet Jer@@ emi@@ ah unto Han@@ ani@@ ah the prophet , He@@ ar now , Han@@ ani@@ ah ; The LORD hath not sent thee ; but thou mak@@ est this people to trust in a lie .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; Be@@ hold , I will cast thee from off the face of the earth : this year thou shalt die , because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD .
now these are the words of the letter that Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the resi@@ due of the elders which were carried away cap@@ tives , and to the priests , and to the prophets , and to all the people whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon ;
( after that J@@ econ@@ i@@ ah the king , and the queen , and the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , the princes of Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem , and the carp@@ enters , and the s@@ mi@@ ths , were departed from Jerusalem ; )
by the hand of El@@ as@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , and G@@ em@@ ari@@ ah the son of Hil@@ ki@@ ah , ( whom Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah sent unto Babylon to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon ) saying ,
take ye wives , and be@@ get sons and daughters ; and take wives for your sons , and give your daughters to husbands , that they may bear sons and daughters ; that ye may be increased there , and not diminished .
and seek the peace of the city whi@@ ther I have caused you to be carried away cap@@ tives , and pray unto the LORD for it : for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace .
for they proph@@ esy fal@@ sely unto you in my name : I have not sent them , sa@@ ith the LORD .
then shall ye call upon me , and ye shall go and pray unto me , and I will hear@@ ken unto you .
and I will be found of you , sa@@ ith the LORD : and I will turn away your cap@@ tivity , and I will gather you from all the nations , and from all the places whi@@ ther I have driven you , sa@@ ith the LORD ; and I will bring you again into the place wh@@ ence I caused you to be carried away captive .
know that thus sa@@ ith the LORD of the king that sit@@ t@@ eth upon the throne of David , and of all the people that dwell@@ eth in this city , and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into cap@@ tivity ;
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts ; Be@@ hold , I will send upon them the sword , the famine , and the pesti@@ l@@ ence , and will make them like v@@ ile fi@@ gs , that C@@ AN@@ NOT be eaten , they are so evil .
hear ye therefore the word of the LORD , all ye of the cap@@ tivity , whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon :
and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the cap@@ tivity of Jud@@ ah which are in Babylon , saying , The LORD make thee like Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah and like A@@ hab , whom the king of Babylon ro@@ asted in the fire ;
because they have committed vill@@ any in Israel , and have committed adul@@ tery with their neighbours ' wives , and have spoken lying words in my name , which I have not commanded them ; even I know , and am a witness , sa@@ ith the LORD .
thus spe@@ ak@@ eth the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel , saying , Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem , and to Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah the son of Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah the priest , and to all the priests , saying ,
the LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ada the priest , that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD , for every man that is mad , and mak@@ eth himself a prophet , that thou shoul@@ dest put him in prison , and in the stocks .
for therefore he sent unto us in Babylon , saying , This cap@@ tivity is long : build ye houses , and dwell in them ; and plant gardens , and eat the fruit of them .
send to all them of the cap@@ tivity , saying , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD concerning Sh@@ em@@ aiah the Ne@@ hel@@ am@@ ite ; Because that Sh@@ em@@ aiah hath prophe@@ si@@ ed unto you , and I sent him not , and he caused you to trust in a lie :
thus spe@@ ak@@ eth the LORD God of Israel , saying , Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book .
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; We have heard a voice of trembling , of fear , and not of peace .
ask ye now , and see whether a man do@@ th trav@@ ail with child ? W@@ herefore do I see every man with his hands on his lo@@ ins , as a woman in trav@@ ail , and all faces are turned into pal@@ eness ?
alas ! for that day is great , so that none is like it : it is even the time of Jacob 's trouble ; but he shall be saved out of it .
for it shall come to pass in that day , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , that I will break his y@@ oke from off thy neck , and will burst thy bonds , and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him :
for I am with thee , sa@@ ith the LORD , to save thee : though I make a full end of all nations whi@@ ther I have scattered thee , yet will I not make a full end of thee : but I will correct thee in measure , and will not leave thee altogether un@@ punished .
for I will restore health unto thee , and I will heal thee of thy wounds , sa@@ ith the LORD ; because they called thee an Out@@ cast , saying , This is Z@@ ion , whom no man see@@ ket@@ h after .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; Be@@ hold , I will bring again the cap@@ tivity of Jacob 's tents , and have mercy on his dwell@@ ing@@ places ; and the city shall be buil@@ ded upon her own heap , and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof .
and their no@@ bles shall be of themselves , and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them ; and I will cause him to draw near , and he shall approach unto me : for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me ? sa@@ ith the LORD .
at the same time , sa@@ ith the LORD , will I be the God of all the families of Israel , and they shall be my people .
for there shall be a day , that the watch@@ men upon the mount E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall cry , A@@ rise ye , and let us go up to Z@@ ion unto the LORD our God .
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; S@@ ing with gl@@ ad@@ ness for Jacob , and shout among the chief of the nations : publish ye , praise ye , and say , O LORD , save thy people , the remn@@ ant of Israel .
they shall come with we@@ eping , and with suppl@@ ications will I lead them : I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way , where@@ in they shall not stum@@ ble : for I am a father to Israel , and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is my fir@@ st@@ born .
hear the word of the LORD , O ye nations , and declare it in the is@@ les af@@ ar off , and say , He that scattered Israel will gather him , and keep him , as a shepherd do@@ th his flock .
then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance , both young men and old together : for I will turn their mourning into joy , and will comfort them , and make them rejoice from their sorrow .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; refrain thy voice from we@@ eping , and th@@ ine eyes from tears : for thy work shall be rewarded , sa@@ ith the LORD ; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy .
surely after that I was turned , I rep@@ ented ; and after that I was instructed , I smo@@ te upon my thi@@ gh : I was ashamed , ye@@ a , even conf@@ ounded , because I did bear the repro@@ ach of my youth .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Jud@@ ah and in the cities thereof , when I shall bring again their cap@@ tivity ; The LORD bless thee , O hab@@ itation of justice , and mountain of hol@@ iness .
behold , the days come , sa@@ ith the LORD , that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel , and with the house of Jud@@ ah :
but this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel ; After those days , sa@@ ith the LORD , I will put my law in their inward parts , and write it in their hearts ; and will be their God , and they shall be my people .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , which gi@@ v@@ eth the sun for a light by day , and the ordin@@ ances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night , which divi@@ det@@ h the sea when the waves thereof ro@@ ar ; The LORD of hosts is his name :
if those ordin@@ ances depart from before me , sa@@ ith the LORD , then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; If heaven above can be measured , and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath , I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done , sa@@ ith the LORD .
behold , the days come , sa@@ ith the LORD , that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Han@@ an@@ e@@ el unto the gate of the corner .
for Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah had shut him up , saying , W@@ herefore d@@ ost thou proph@@ esy , and say , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD , Be@@ hold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall take it ;
and Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon , and shall speak with him mouth to mouth , and his eyes shall behold his eyes ;
and I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Bar@@ uch the son of N@@ eri@@ ah , the son of Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah , in the sight of Han@@ ame@@ el mine uncle 's son , and in the presence of the witnesses that subscri@@ bed the book of the purchase , before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Take these evid@@ ences , this evidence of the purchase , both which is sealed , and this evidence which is open ; and put them in an ear@@ then vessel , that they may continue many days .
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; H@@ ouses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land .
Ah Lord GO@@ D ! behold , thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm , and there is nothing too hard for thee :
thou sh@@ ew@@ est lov@@ ing@@ kindness unto thousands , and re@@ compens@@ est the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the fathers into the bos@@ om of their children after them : the Great , the Mi@@ ghty God , the LORD of hosts , is his name ,
great in counsel , and mighty in work : for th@@ ine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men : to give every one according to his ways , and according to the fruit of his do@@ ings :
which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt , even unto this day , and in Israel , and among other men ; and hast made thee a name , as at this day ;
and thou hast said unto me , O Lord GO@@ D , Buy thee the field for money , and take witnesses ; for the city is given into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
behold , I am the LORD , the God of all flesh : is there any thing too hard for me ?
therefore thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; Be@@ hold , I will give this city into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon , and he shall take it :
and the Chal@@ de@@ ans , that fight against this city , shall come and set fire on this city , and burn it with the houses , upon whose roofs they have offered inc@@ ense unto Ba@@ al , and poured out drink offerings unto other gods , to provoke me to anger .
for the children of Israel and the children of Jud@@ ah have only done evil before me from their youth : for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands , sa@@ ith the LORD .
for this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day ; that I should remove it from before my face ,
because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Jud@@ ah , which they have done to provoke me to anger , they , their kings , their princes , their priests , and their prophets , and the men of Jud@@ ah , and the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
and they have turned unto me the back , and not the face : though I taught them , rising up early and teaching them , yet they have not hear@@ k@@ ened to receive instruction .
and now therefore thus sa@@ ith the LORD , the God of Israel , concerning this city , where@@ of ye say , It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pesti@@ l@@ ence ;
behold , I will gather them out of all countries , whi@@ ther I have driven them in mine anger , and in my fury , and in great wrath ; and I will bring them again unto this place , and I will cause them to dwell safely :
and I will give them one heart , and one way , that they may fear me for ever , for the good of them , and of their children after them :
and I will make an everlasting covenant with them , that I will not turn away from them , to do them good ; but I will put my fear in their hearts , that they shall not depart from me .
they come to fight with the Chal@@ de@@ ans , but it is fill them with the dead bodies of men , whom I have sl@@ ain in mine anger and in my fury , and for all whose w@@ ick@@ edness I have hid my face from this city .
behold , I will bring it health and cure , and I will cure them , and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth .
and I will clean@@ se them from all their ini@@ qu@@ ity , whereby they have sin@@ ned against me ; and I will pardon all their ini@@ qu@@ ities , whereby they have sin@@ ned , and whereby they have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts ; Again in this place , which is des@@ ol@@ ate without man and without beast , and in all the cities thereof , shall be an hab@@ itation of shep@@ herds causing their f@@ locks to lie down .
behold , the days come , sa@@ ith the LORD , that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Jud@@ ah .
in those days shall Jud@@ ah be saved , and Jerusalem shall dwell safely : and this is the name where@@ with she shall be called , The LORD our righteousness .
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel ;
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; If ye can break my covenant of the day , and my covenant of the night , and that there should not be day and night in their season ;
then will I cast away the seed of Jacob , and David my servant , so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob : for I will cause their cap@@ tivity to return , and have mercy on them .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , the God of Israel ; Go and speak to Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , and tell him , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD ; Be@@ hold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall burn it with fire :
and thou shalt not escape out of his hand , but shalt surely be taken , and delivered into his hand ; and th@@ ine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon , and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth , and thou shalt go to Babylon .
yet hear the word of the LORD , O Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah ; Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD of thee , Th@@ ou shalt not die by the sword :
when the king of Babylon 's army fought against Jerusalem , and against all the cities of Jud@@ ah that were left , against L@@ ach@@ ish , and against A@@ ze@@ k@@ ah : for these def@@ enced cities remained of the cities of Jud@@ ah .
this is the word that came unto Jer@@ emi@@ ah from the LORD , after that the king Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem , to proclaim liberty unto them ;
that every man should let his man@@ servant , and every man his mai@@ d@@ servant , being an Hebrew or an He@@ bre@@ w@@ ess , go free ; that none should serve himself of them , to w@@ it , of a Jew his brother .
but afterward they turned , and caused the servants and the hand@@ m@@ aids , whom they had let go free , to return , and brought them into subj@@ ection for servants and for hand@@ m@@ aids .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , the God of Israel ; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , out of the house of bond@@ men , saying ,
and ye were now turned , and had done right in my sight , in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour ; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name :
and I will give the men that have trans@@ g@@ ressed my covenant , which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me , when they cut the cal@@ f in tw@@ ain , and passed between the parts thereof ,
and Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of them that seek their life , and into the hand of the king of Babylon 's army , which are gone up from you .
behold , I will command , sa@@ ith the LORD , and cause them to return to this city ; and they shall fight against it , and take it , and burn it with fire : and I will make the cities of Jud@@ ah a des@@ ol@@ ation without an inhabit@@ ant .
the word which came unto Jer@@ emi@@ ah from the LORD in the days of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jo@@ si@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , saying ,
go unto the house of the Rec@@ hab@@ ites , and speak unto them , and bring them into the house of the LORD , into one of the chambers , and give them wine to drink .
then I took Ja@@ az@@ ani@@ ah the son of Jer@@ emi@@ ah , the son of Hab@@ az@@ ini@@ ah , and his brethren , and all his sons , and the whole house of the Rec@@ hab@@ ites ;
but it came to pass , when Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon came up into the land , that we said , Come , and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and for fear of the army of the Syrians : so we dwell at Jerusalem .
because the sons of Jon@@ ad@@ ab the son of Rec@@ hab have performed the commandment of their father , which he commanded them ; but this people hath not hear@@ k@@ ened unto me :
and Jer@@ emi@@ ah said unto the house of the Rec@@ hab@@ ites , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jon@@ ad@@ ab your father , and kept all his prec@@ epts , and done according unto all that he hath commanded you :
take thee a roll of a book , and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel , and against Jud@@ ah , and against all the nations , from the day I sp@@ ake unto thee , from the days of Jo@@ si@@ ah , even unto this day .
it may be that the house of Jud@@ ah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them ; that they may return every man from his evil way ; that I may forgive their ini@@ qu@@ ity and their sin .
it may be they will present their suppl@@ ication before the LORD , and will return every one from his evil way : for great is the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people .
then read Bar@@ uch in the book the words of Jer@@ emi@@ ah in the house of the LORD , in the chamber of G@@ em@@ ari@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an the scri@@ be , in the higher court , at the entry of the new gate of the LORD 's house , in the ears of all the people .
when Mic@@ ha@@ i@@ ah the son of G@@ em@@ ari@@ ah , the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD ,
then Mic@@ ha@@ i@@ ah declared unto them all the words that he had heard , when Bar@@ uch read the book in the ears of the people .
and they said unto him , S@@ it down now , and read it in our ears . so Bar@@ uch read it in their ears .
so the king sent Je@@ h@@ ud@@ i to fetch the roll : and he took it out of Elis@@ h@@ ama the scri@@ be 's chamber . and Je@@ h@@ ud@@ i read it in the ears of the king , and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king .
and it came to pass , that when Je@@ h@@ ud@@ i had read three or four leaves , he cut it with the pen@@ knife , and cast it into the fire that was on the hear@@ th , until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hear@@ th .
nevertheless El@@ na@@ than and Del@@ aiah and G@@ em@@ ari@@ ah had made interc@@ ession to the king that he would not burn the roll : but he would not hear them .
but the king commanded Jer@@ ah@@ me@@ el the son of Ham@@ m@@ elec@@ h , and Ser@@ aiah the son of Az@@ riel , and Shel@@ emi@@ ah the son of Ab@@ de@@ el , to take Bar@@ uch the scri@@ be and Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet : but the LORD hid them .
then the word of the LORD came to Jer@@ emi@@ ah , after that the king had burned the roll , and the words which Bar@@ uch wrote at the mouth of Jer@@ emi@@ ah , saying ,
therefore thus sa@@ ith the LORD of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im king of Jud@@ ah ; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David : and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat , and in the night to the frost .
and I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their ini@@ qu@@ ity ; and I will bring upon them , and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem , and upon the men of Jud@@ ah , all the evil that I have pronounced against them ; but they hear@@ k@@ ened not .
but neither he , nor his servants , nor the people of the land , did hear@@ ken unto the words of the LORD , which he sp@@ ake by the prophet Jer@@ emi@@ ah .
and Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the king sent Je@@ h@@ uc@@ al the son of Shel@@ emi@@ ah and Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah the son of Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah the priest to the prophet Jer@@ emi@@ ah , saying , Pr@@ ay now unto the LORD our God for us .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , the God of Israel ; Th@@ us shall ye say to the king of Jud@@ ah , that sent you unto me to inqu@@ ire of me ; Be@@ hold , Phar@@ aoh 's army , which is come forth to help you , shall return to Egypt into their own land .
and when he was in the gate of Benjamin , a captain of the ward was there , whose name was I@@ ri@@ jah , the son of Shel@@ emi@@ ah , the son of Han@@ ani@@ ah ; and he took Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet , saying , Th@@ ou fall@@ est away to the Chal@@ de@@ ans .
W@@ herefore the princes were w@@ ro@@ th with Jer@@ emi@@ ah , and smo@@ te him , and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scri@@ be : for they had made that the prison .
then Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the king sent , and took him out : and the king asked him secretly in his house , and said , Is there any word from the LORD ? and Jer@@ emi@@ ah said , There is : for , said he , thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon .
then Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the king commanded that they should commit Jer@@ emi@@ ah into the court of the prison , and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the b@@ akers ' street , until all the bread in the city were spent . thus Jer@@ emi@@ ah remained in the court of the prison .
then Sh@@ eph@@ ati@@ ah the son of M@@ attan , and G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of Pash@@ ur , and J@@ uc@@ al the son of Shel@@ emi@@ ah , and Pash@@ ur the son of Mal@@ chi@@ ah , heard the words that Jer@@ emi@@ ah had spoken unto all the people , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , He that remain@@ eth in this city shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pesti@@ l@@ ence : but he that go@@ eth forth to the Chal@@ de@@ ans shall live ; for he shall have his life for a prey , and shall live .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD , This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon 's army , which shall take it .
then Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the king said , Be@@ hold , he is in your hand : for the king is not he that can do any thing against you .
then took they Jer@@ emi@@ ah , and cast him into the dun@@ geon of Mal@@ chi@@ ah the son of Ham@@ m@@ elec@@ h , that was in the court of the prison : and they let down Jer@@ emi@@ ah with cor@@ ds . and in the dun@@ geon there was no water , but mire : so Jer@@ emi@@ ah sunk in the mire .
now when E@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ m@@ elec@@ h the Ethiopian , one of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s which was in the king 's house , heard that they had put Jer@@ emi@@ ah in the dun@@ geon ; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin ;
then the king commanded E@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ m@@ elec@@ h the Ethiopian , saying , Take from hence thirty men with thee , and take up Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet out of the dun@@ geon , before he die .
so E@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ m@@ elec@@ h took the men with him , and went into the house of the king under the treasury , and took th@@ ence old cast cl@@ outs and old ro@@ tten r@@ ags , and let them down by cor@@ ds into the dun@@ geon to Jer@@ emi@@ ah .
and E@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ m@@ elec@@ h the Ethiopian said unto Jer@@ emi@@ ah , P@@ ut now these old cast cl@@ outs and ro@@ tten r@@ ags under th@@ ine arm@@ holes under the cor@@ ds . and Jer@@ emi@@ ah did so .
so they drew up Jer@@ emi@@ ah with cor@@ ds , and took him up out of the dun@@ geon : and Jer@@ emi@@ ah remained in the court of the prison .
then Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the king sent , and took Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD : and the king said unto Jer@@ emi@@ ah , I will ask thee a thing ; hide nothing from me .
then Jer@@ emi@@ ah said unto Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah , If I declare it unto thee , wil@@ t thou not surely put me to death ? and if I give thee counsel , wil@@ t thou not hear@@ ken unto me ?
so Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the king sw@@ are secretly unto Jer@@ emi@@ ah , saying , As the LORD liv@@ eth , that made us this soul , I will not put thee to death , neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life .
but if thou wil@@ t not go forth to the king of Babylon 's princes , then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and they shall burn it with fire , and thou shalt not escape out of their hand .
but Jer@@ emi@@ ah said , They shall not deliver thee . obey , I bes@@ e@@ ech thee , the voice of the LORD , which I speak unto thee : so it shall be well unto thee , and thy soul shall live .
so they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chal@@ de@@ ans : and thou shalt not escape out of their hand , but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon : and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire .
then came all the princes unto Jer@@ emi@@ ah , and asked him : and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded . so they left off speaking with him ; for the matter was not perceived .
and in the eleventh year of Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah , in the fourth month , the ninth day of the month , the city was broken up .
but the Chal@@ de@@ ans ' army pursued after them , and over@@ took Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah in the plains of Jer@@ ich@@ o : and when they had taken him , they brought him up to Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon to Ri@@ b@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath , where he gave judgment upon him .
then the king of Babylon sle@@ w the sons of Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah in Ri@@ b@@ lah before his eyes : also the king of Babylon sle@@ w all the no@@ bles of Jud@@ ah .
but Ne@@ bu@@ z@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ Ad@@ an the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people , which had nothing , in the land of Jud@@ ah , and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time .
so Ne@@ bu@@ z@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ Ad@@ an the captain of the guard sent , and Ne@@ b@@ ush@@ as@@ ban , R@@ ab @@@ -@@ @ sar@@ is , and Ner@@ gal @@@ -@@ @ share@@ zer , Rab@@ ma@@ g , and all the king of Babylon 's princes ;
even they sent , and took Jer@@ emi@@ ah out of the court of the prison , and committed him unto G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , that he should carry him home : so he d@@ wel@@ t among the people .
but I will deliver thee in that day , sa@@ ith the LORD : and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid .
for I will surely deliver thee , and thou shalt not fall by the sword , but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee : because thou hast put thy trust in me , sa@@ ith the LORD .
the word that came to Jer@@ emi@@ ah from the LORD , after that Ne@@ bu@@ z@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ Ad@@ an the captain of the guard had let him go from Ram@@ ah , when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Jud@@ ah , which were carried away captive unto Babylon .
and the captain of the guard took Jer@@ emi@@ ah , and said unto him , The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place .
now the LORD hath brought it , and done according as he hath said : because ye have sin@@ ned against the LORD , and have not obeyed his voice , therefore this thing is come upon you .
and G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an sw@@ are unto them and to their men , saying , Fe@@ ar not to serve the Chal@@ de@@ ans : dwell in the land , and serve the king of Babylon , and it shall be well with you .
likewise when all the Jews that were in Mo@@ ab , and among the Am@@ mon@@ ites , and in E@@ dom , and that were in all the countries , heard that the king of Babylon had left a remn@@ ant of Jud@@ ah , and that he had set over them G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an ;
now it came to pass in the seventh month , that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ ani@@ ah the son of Elis@@ h@@ ama , of the seed royal , and the princes of the king , even ten men with him , came unto G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am to M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h ; and there they did eat bread together in M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h .
then arose I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ ani@@ ah , and the ten men that were with him , and smo@@ te G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an with the sword , and sle@@ w him , whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land .
I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el also sle@@ w all the Jews that were with him , even with G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , at M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h , and the Chal@@ de@@ ans that were found there , and the men of war .
and it came to pass the second day after he had sl@@ ain G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , and no man knew it ,
and I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ ani@@ ah went forth from M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h to meet them , we@@ eping all along as he went : and it came to pass , as he met them , he said unto them , Come to G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am .
but when Johan@@ an the son of Kare@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces that were with him , heard of all the evil that I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ ani@@ ah had done ,
then they took all the men , and went to fight with I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ ani@@ ah , and found him by the great waters that are in Gi@@ be@@ on .
and they departed , and d@@ wel@@ t in the hab@@ itation of Ch@@ im@@ ham , which is by Bethlehem , to go to enter into Egypt ,
because of the Chal@@ de@@ ans : for they were afraid of them , because I@@ sh@@ ma@@ el the son of N@@ eth@@ ani@@ ah had sl@@ ain G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah the son of A@@ hi@@ k@@ am , whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land .
then all the cap@@ tains of the forces , and Johan@@ an the son of Kare@@ ah , and J@@ ez@@ ani@@ ah the son of Hos@@ ha@@ i@@ ah , and all the people from the least even unto the greatest , came near ,
then they said to Jer@@ emi@@ ah , The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us , if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us .
then called he Johan@@ an the son of Kare@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces which were with him , and all the people from the least even to the greatest ,
be not afraid of the king of Babylon , of whom ye are afraid ; be not afraid of him , sa@@ ith the LORD : for I am with you to save you , and to deliver you from his hand .
and I will sh@@ ew mer@@ cies unto you , that he may have mercy upon you , and cause you to return to your own land .
saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trum@@ pet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell :
and now therefore hear the word of the LORD , ye remn@@ ant of Jud@@ ah ; Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt , and go to so@@ jour@@ n there ;
then it shall come to pass , that the sword , which ye feared , shall over@@ take you there in the land of Egypt , and the famine , where@@ of ye were afraid , shall follow close after you there in Egypt ; and there ye shall die .
now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pesti@@ l@@ ence , in the place whi@@ ther ye desire to go and to so@@ jour@@ n .
but Bar@@ uch the son of N@@ eri@@ ah sett@@ eth thee on against us , for to deliver us into the hand of the Chal@@ de@@ ans , that they might put us to death , and carry us away cap@@ tives into Babylon .
so Johan@@ an the son of Kare@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , and all the people , obeyed not the voice of the LORD , to dwell in the land of Jud@@ ah .
but Johan@@ an the son of Kare@@ ah , and all the cap@@ tains of the forces , took all the remn@@ ant of Jud@@ ah , that were returned from all nations , whi@@ ther they had been driven , to dwell in the land of Jud@@ ah ;
and when he com@@ eth , he shall sm@@ ite the land of Egypt , and deliver such as are for death to death ; and such as are for cap@@ tivity to cap@@ tivity ; and such as are for the sword to the sword .
the word that came to Jer@@ emi@@ ah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of Egypt , which dwell at M@@ ig@@ dol , and at Tah@@ pan@@ hes , and at N@@ op@@ h , and in the country of P@@ ath@@ ros , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Y@@ e have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem , and upon all the cities of Jud@@ ah ; and , behold , this day they are a des@@ ol@@ ation , and no man dwell@@ eth therein ,
because of their w@@ ick@@ edness which they have committed to provoke me to anger , in that they went to burn inc@@ ense , and to serve other gods , whom they knew not , neither they , ye , nor your fathers .
W@@ herefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth , and was kind@@ led in the cities of Jud@@ ah and in the streets of Jerusalem ; and they are wasted and des@@ ol@@ ate , as at this day .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Be@@ hold , I will set my face against you for evil , and to cut off all Jud@@ ah .
and when we burned inc@@ ense to the queen of heaven , and poured out drink offerings unto her , did we make her cakes to worship her , and pour out drink offerings unto her , without our men ?
moreover Jer@@ emi@@ ah said unto all the people , and to all the women , He@@ ar the word of the LORD , all Jud@@ ah that are in the land of Egypt :
behold , I will watch over them for evil , and not for good : and all the men of Jud@@ ah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine , until there be an end of them .
yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Jud@@ ah , and all the remn@@ ant of Jud@@ ah , that are gone into the land of Egypt to so@@ jour@@ n there , shall know whose words shall stand , mine , or theirs .
and this shall be a sign unto you , sa@@ ith the LORD , that I will punish you in this place , that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil :
the word that Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet sp@@ ake unto Bar@@ uch the son of N@@ eri@@ ah , when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jer@@ emi@@ ah , in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jo@@ si@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , saying ,
thus shalt thou say unto him , The LORD sa@@ ith thus ; Be@@ hold , that which I have built will I break down , and that which I have planted I will pl@@ uck up , even this whole land .
and see@@ k@@ est thou great things for thy@@ self ? seek them not : for , behold , I will bring evil upon all flesh , sa@@ ith the LORD : but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whi@@ ther thou go@@ est .
against Egypt , against the army of Phar@@ aoh @@@ -@@ @ nec@@ ho king of Egypt , which was by the river E@@ uph@@ rates in C@@ arch@@ emish , which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon smo@@ te in the fourth year of Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im the son of Jo@@ si@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah .
harness the horses ; and get up , ye hor@@ sem@@ en , and stand forth with your hel@@ mets ; furb@@ ish the spe@@ ars , and put on the bri@@ g@@ and@@ ines .
W@@ herefore have I seen them dis@@ may@@ ed and turned away back ? and their mighty ones are beaten down , and are fled ap@@ ace , and look not back : for fear was round about , sa@@ ith the LORD .
let not the swift flee away , nor the mighty man escape ; they shall stum@@ ble , and fall toward the north by the river E@@ uph@@ rates .
Egypt ris@@ eth up like a flood , and his waters are moved like the rivers ; and he sa@@ ith , I will go up , and will cover the earth ; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof .
come up , ye horses ; and rage , ye ch@@ ari@@ ots ; and let the mighty men come forth ; the Ethiop@@ ians and the Liby@@ ans , that handle the shield ; and the Ly@@ dians , that handle and bend the bow .
go up into Gil@@ e@@ ad , and take bal@@ m , O virgin , the daughter of Egypt : in vain shalt thou use many medicines ; for thou shalt not be cured .
the nations have heard of thy shame , and thy cry hath filled the land : for the mighty man hath stum@@ bled against the mighty , and they are fallen both together .
the word that the LORD sp@@ ake to Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet , how Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon should come and sm@@ ite the land of Egypt .
declare ye in Egypt , and publish in M@@ ig@@ dol , and publish in N@@ op@@ h and in Tah@@ pan@@ hes : say ye , Stand fast , and prepare thee ; for the sword shall dev@@ our round about thee .
he made many to fall , ye@@ a , one fell upon another : and they said , A@@ rise , and let us go again to our own people , and to the land of our n@@ ativity , from the op@@ pressing sword .
as I live , sa@@ ith the King , whose name is the LORD of hosts , Su@@ rely as Tab@@ or is among the mountains , and as Car@@ me@@ l by the sea , so shall he come .
Egypt is like a very fair hei@@ fer , but destruction com@@ eth ; it com@@ eth out of the north .
also her hired men are in the midst of her like fat@@ ted bul@@ locks ; for they also are turned back , and are fled away together : they did not stand , because the day of their calamity was come upon them , and the time of their vis@@ itation .
the voice thereof shall go like a ser@@ pent ; for they shall march with an army , and come against her with axes , as he@@ w@@ ers of wood .
they shall cut down her forest , sa@@ ith the LORD , though it C@@ AN@@ NOT be searched ; because they are more than the gras@@ shop@@ pers , and are innumerable .
the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel , sa@@ ith ; Be@@ hold , I will punish the multitude of No , and Phar@@ aoh , and Egypt , with their gods , and their kings ; even Phar@@ aoh , and all them that trust in him :
and I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives , and into the hand of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon , and into the hand of his servants : and afterward it shall be inhabited , as in the days of old , sa@@ ith the LORD .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; Be@@ hold , waters rise up out of the north , and shall be an over@@ flowing flood , and shall over@@ flow the land , and all that is therein ; the city , and them that dwell therein : then the men shall cry , and all the inhabitants of the land shall how@@ l .
at the noise of the stam@@ ping of the hoo@@ fs of his strong horses , at the rushing of his ch@@ ari@@ ots , and at the rum@@ bling of his wheels , the fathers shall not look back to their children for fee@@ bl@@ eness of hands ;
because of the day that com@@ eth to spoil all the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and to cut off from Ty@@ rus and Z@@ id@@ on every hel@@ per that remain@@ eth : for the LORD will spoil the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , the remn@@ ant of the country of Cap@@ h@@ tor .
O thou sword of the LORD , how long will it be ere thou be quiet ? put up thy@@ self into thy S@@ cab@@ bard , rest , and be still .
how can it be quiet , seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against Ash@@ kel@@ on , and against the sea shore ? there hath he appointed it .
against Mo@@ ab thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; W@@ oe unto Ne@@ bo ! for it is spoiled : Kiri@@ ath@@ aim is conf@@ ounded and taken : Mis@@ g@@ ab is conf@@ ounded and dis@@ may@@ ed .
there shall be no more praise of Mo@@ ab : in H@@ esh@@ bon they have devised evil against it ; come , and let us cut it off from being a nation . also thou shalt be cut down , O mad@@ men ; the sword shall pursue thee .
for in the going up of Lu@@ h@@ ith continual we@@ eping shall go up ; for in the going down of Hor@@ on@@ aim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction .
and the spo@@ iler shall come upon every city , and no city shall escape : the valley also shall perish , and the plain shall be destroyed , as the LORD hath spoken .
Mo@@ ab hath been at ease from his youth , and he hath settled on his le@@ es , and hath not been emp@@ tied from vessel to vessel , neither hath he gone into cap@@ tivity : therefore his taste remained in him , and his scent is not changed .
therefore , behold , the days come , sa@@ ith the LORD , that I will send unto him wan@@ der@@ ers , that shall cause him to wander , and shall empty his vessels , and break their bottles .
Mo@@ ab is spoiled , and gone up out of her cities , and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter , sa@@ ith the King , whose name is the LORD of hosts .
all ye that are about him , b@@ emo@@ an him ; and all ye that know his name , say , How is the strong staff broken , and the beautiful rod !
thou daughter that d@@ ost inhabit Di@@ bon , come down from thy glory , and sit in thirst ; for the spo@@ iler of Mo@@ ab shall come upon thee , and he shall destroy thy strong holds .
Mo@@ ab is conf@@ ounded ; for it is broken down : how@@ l and cry ; and tell ye it in Ar@@ non , that Mo@@ ab is spoiled ,
the horn of Mo@@ ab is cut off , and his arm is broken , sa@@ ith the LORD .
make ye him drun@@ ken : for he magni@@ fied himself against the LORD : Mo@@ ab also shall wal@@ low in his vom@@ it , and he also shall be in deri@@ sion .
we have heard the pride of Mo@@ ab , ( he is exceeding proud ) his lo@@ ft@@ iness , and his ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ cy , and his pride , and the ha@@ u@@ ght@@ iness of his heart .
O vine of Sib@@ ma@@ h , I will we@@ ep for thee with the we@@ eping of J@@ az@@ er : thy plants are gone over the sea , they reach even to the sea of J@@ az@@ er : the spo@@ iler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy v@@ intage .
therefore mine heart shall sound for Mo@@ ab like pipes , and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of K@@ ir @@@ -@@ @ heres : because the riches that he hath gotten are perished .
for every head shall be bal@@ d , and every beard cli@@ pped : upon all the hands shall be cut@@ tings , and upon the lo@@ ins s@@ ack@@ cloth .
K@@ eri@@ o@@ th is taken , and the strong holds are surprised , and the mighty men 's hearts in Mo@@ ab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her p@@ ang@@ s .
he that fle@@ eth from the fear shall fall into the pit ; and he that get@@ t@@ eth up out of the pit shall be taken in the sn@@ are : for I will bring upon it , even upon Mo@@ ab , the year of their vis@@ itation , sa@@ ith the LORD .
how@@ l , O H@@ esh@@ bon , for A@@ i is spoiled : cry , ye daughters of Rab@@ ba@@ h , gir@@ d you with s@@ ack@@ cloth ; lam@@ ent , and run to and fro by the h@@ edges ; for their king shall go into cap@@ tivity , and his priests and his princes together .
and afterward I will bring again the cap@@ tivity of the children of Am@@ mon , sa@@ ith the LORD .
flee ye , turn back , dwell deep , O inhabitants of D@@ ed@@ an ; for I will bring the calamity of Es@@ au upon him , the time that I will visit him .
but I have made Es@@ au bare , I have uncovered his secret places , and he shall not be able to hide himself : his seed is spoiled , and his brethren , and his neighbours , and he is not .
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; Be@@ hold , they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assu@@ re@@ dly drun@@ ken ; and art thou he that shall altogether go un@@ punished ? thou shalt not go un@@ punished , but thou shalt surely drink of it .
for I have sworn by myself , sa@@ ith the LORD , that Bo@@ z@@ rah shall become a des@@ ol@@ ation , a repro@@ ach , a waste , and a curse ; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes .
I have heard a rum@@ our from the LORD , and an ambassador is sent unto the he@@ a@@ then , saying , G@@ ather ye together , and come against her , and rise up to the battle .
also E@@ dom shall be a des@@ ol@@ ation : every one that go@@ eth by it shall be astonished , and shall h@@ iss at all the pl@@ agues thereof .
the earth is moved at the noise of their fall , at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea .
behold , he shall come up and fly as the eagle , and spread his wings over Bo@@ z@@ rah : and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of E@@ dom be as the heart of a woman in her p@@ ang@@ s .
concerning Damascus . Ham@@ ath is conf@@ ounded , and Ar@@ pad : for they have heard evil ti@@ dings : they are fain@@ the@@ ar@@ ted ; there is sorrow on the sea ; it C@@ AN@@ NOT be quiet .
Damascus is wa@@ xed fee@@ ble , and tur@@ neth herself to flee , and fear hath seized on her : angu@@ ish and sor@@ rows have taken her , as a woman in trav@@ ail .
therefore her young men shall fall in her streets , and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
concerning K@@ edar , and concerning the king@@ doms of Haz@@ or , which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon shall sm@@ ite , thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; A@@ rise ye , go up to K@@ edar , and spoil the men of the east .
their tents and their f@@ locks shall they take away : they shall take to themselves their curtains , and all their vessels , and their cam@@ els ; and they shall cry unto them , Fe@@ ar is on every side .
flee , get you far off , dwell deep , O ye inhabitants of Haz@@ or , sa@@ ith the LORD ; for Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you , and hath conceived a purpose against you .
and their cam@@ els shall be a boo@@ ty , and the multitude of their cattle a spoil : and I will sc@@ atter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners ; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof , sa@@ ith the LORD .
and Haz@@ or shall be a dwelling for dragons , and a des@@ ol@@ ation for ever : there shall no man abide there , nor any son of man dwell in it .
the word of the LORD that came to Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet against EL@@ AM in the beginning of the reign of Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , saying ,
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts ; Be@@ hold , I will break the bow of EL@@ AM , the chief of their might .
and upon EL@@ AM will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven , and will sc@@ atter them toward all those winds ; and there shall be no nation whi@@ ther the out@@ casts of EL@@ AM shall not come .
for I will cause EL@@ AM to be dis@@ may@@ ed before their enemies , and before them that seek their life : and I will bring evil upon them even my fierce anger , sa@@ ith the LORD ; and I will send the sword after them , till I have consumed them :
and I will set my throne in EL@@ AM , and will destroy from th@@ ence the king and the princes , sa@@ ith the LORD .
the word that the LORD sp@@ ake against Babylon and against the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans by Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet .
declare ye among the nations , and publish , and set up a standard ; publish , and conceal not : say , Babylon is taken , B@@ el is conf@@ ounded , Mer@@ od@@ ach is broken in pieces ; her idols are conf@@ ounded , her images are broken in pieces .
for out of the north there com@@ eth up a nation against her , which shall make her land des@@ ol@@ ate , and none shall dwell therein : they shall remove , they shall depart , both man and beast .
in those days , and in that time , sa@@ ith the LORD , the children of Israel shall come , they and the children of Jud@@ ah together , going and we@@ eping : they shall go , and seek the LORD their God .
my people hath been lost sheep : their shep@@ herds have caused them to go astr@@ ay , they have turned them away on the mountains : they have gone from mountain to hill , they have forgotten their rest@@ ing@@ place .
because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited , but it shall be wholly des@@ ol@@ ate : every one that go@@ eth by Babylon shall be astonished , and h@@ iss at all her pl@@ agues .
put yourselves in array against Babylon round about : all ye that bend the bow , shoot at her , spare no arrows : for she hath sin@@ ned against the LORD .
cut off the s@@ ower from Babylon , and him that hand@@ let@@ h the sick@@ le in the time of harvest : for fear of the op@@ pressing sword they shall turn every one to his people , and they shall flee every one to his own land .
Israel is a scattered sheep ; the lions have driven him away : first the king of As@@ sy@@ ria hath dev@@ oured him ; and last this Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon hath broken his bones .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Be@@ hold , I will punish the king of Babylon and his land , as I have punished the king of As@@ sy@@ ria .
in those days , and in that time , sa@@ ith the LORD , the ini@@ qu@@ ity of Israel shall be sought for , and there shall be none ; and the sins of Jud@@ ah , and they shall not be found : for I will pardon them whom I reserve .
go up against the land of Mer@@ ath@@ aim , even against it , and against the inhabitants of Pe@@ k@@ od : waste and utterly destroy after them , sa@@ ith the LORD , and do according to all that I have commanded thee .
I have laid a sn@@ are for thee , and thou art also taken , O Babylon , and thou w@@ ast not aware : thou art found , and also caught , because thou hast stri@@ ven against the LORD .
sl@@ ay all her bul@@ locks ; let them go down to the slaughter : w@@ oe unto them ! for their day is come , the time of their vis@@ itation .
the voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon , to declare in Z@@ ion the vengeance of the LORD our God , the vengeance of his temple .
therefore shall her young men fall in the streets , and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day , sa@@ ith the LORD .
behold , I am against thee , O thou most proud , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D of hosts : for thy day is come , the time that I will visit thee .
and the most proud shall stum@@ ble and fall , and none shall raise him up : and I will kind@@ le a fire in his cities , and it shall dev@@ our all round about him .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts ; The children of Israel and the children of Jud@@ ah were oppressed together : and all that took them cap@@ tives held them fast ; they refused to let them go .
their Re@@ deem@@ er is strong ; the LORD of hosts is his name : he shall through@@ ly ple@@ ad their cause , that he may give rest to the land , and dis@@ quiet the inhabitants of Babylon .
a sword is upon the Chal@@ de@@ ans , sa@@ ith the LORD , and upon the inhabitants of Babylon , and upon her princes , and upon her wise men .
a sword is upon their horses , and upon their ch@@ ari@@ ots , and upon all the ming@@ led people that are in the midst of her ; and they shall become as women : a sword is upon her treasures ; and they shall be robbed .
a drought is upon her waters ; and they shall be dried up : for it is the land of gra@@ ven images , and they are mad upon their idols .
the king of Babylon hath heard the report of them , and his hands wa@@ xed fee@@ ble : angu@@ ish took hold of him , and p@@ ang@@ s as of a woman in trav@@ ail .
and will send unto Babylon f@@ anners , that shall fan her , and shall empty her land : for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about .
for Israel hath not been for@@ s@@ aken , nor Jud@@ ah of his God , of the LORD of hosts ; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel .
flee out of the midst of Babylon , and deliver every man his soul : be not cut off in her ini@@ qu@@ ity ; for this is the time of the LORD 's vengeance ; he will render unto her a re@@ comp@@ ence .
we would have healed Babylon , but she is not healed : for@@ sake her , and let us go every one into his own country : for her judgment re@@ ach@@ eth unto heaven , and is lifted up even to the skies .
the LORD hath brought forth our righteousness : come , and let us declare in Z@@ ion the work of the LORD our God .
make bright the arrows ; gather the shi@@ elds : the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Med@@ es : for his device is against Babylon , to destroy it ; because it is the vengeance of the LORD , the vengeance of his temple .
set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon , make the watch strong , set up the watch@@ men , prepare the amb@@ ushes : for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he sp@@ ake against the inhabitants of Babylon .
the LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself , saying , Su@@ rely I will fill thee with men , as with cat@@ er@@ pill@@ ers ; and they shall lift up a shout against thee .
every man is bru@@ tish by his knowledge ; every founder is conf@@ ounded by the gra@@ ven image : for his mol@@ ten image is false@@ hood , and there is no breath in them .
the portion of Jacob is not like them ; for he is the former of all things : and Israel is the rod of his inheritance : the LORD of hosts is his name .
and I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chal@@ dea all their evil that they have done in Z@@ ion in your sight , sa@@ ith the LORD .
behold , I am against thee , O destroying mountain , sa@@ ith the LORD , which destro@@ y@@ est all the earth : and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee , and roll thee down from the rocks , and will make thee a burnt mountain .
and they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner , nor a stone for foundations ; but thou shalt be des@@ ol@@ ate for ever , sa@@ ith the LORD .
set ye up a standard in the land , blow the trum@@ pet among the nations , prepare the nations against her , call together against her the king@@ doms of Ar@@ ar@@ at , Min@@ ni , and Ash@@ ch@@ en@@ az ; appoint a captain against her ; cause the horses to come up as the rough cat@@ er@@ pill@@ ers .
prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Med@@ es , the cap@@ tains thereof , and all the rulers thereof , and all the land of his dom@@ inion .
the mighty men of Babylon have for@@ born to fight , they have remained in their holds : their might hath failed ; they became as women : they have burned her dwell@@ ing@@ places ; her bars are broken .
one post shall run to meet another , and one messenger to meet another , to sh@@ ew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end ,
the violence done to me and to my flesh be upon Babylon , shall the inhabit@@ ant of Z@@ ion say ; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chal@@ dea , shall Jerusalem say .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; Be@@ hold , I will ple@@ ad thy cause , and take vengeance for thee ; and I will dry up her sea , and make her springs dry .
and Babylon shall become he@@ aps , a dwell@@ ing@@ place for dragons , an aston@@ ishment , and an his@@ sing , without an inhabit@@ ant .
in their heat I will make their fe@@ asts , and I will make them drun@@ ken , that they may rejoice , and sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake , sa@@ ith the LORD .
and lest your heart faint , and ye fear for the rum@@ our that shall be heard in the land ; a rum@@ our shall both come one year , and after that in another year shall come a rum@@ our , and violence in the land , ruler against ruler .
then the heaven and the earth , and all that is therein , shall sing for Babylon : for the spo@@ il@@ ers shall come unto her from the north , sa@@ ith the LORD .
ye that have escaped the sword , go away , stand not still : remember the LORD af@@ ar off , and let Jerusalem come into your mind .
we are conf@@ ounded , because we have heard repro@@ ach : shame hath covered our faces : for strangers are come into the sanc@@ tu@@ aries of the LORD 's house .
W@@ herefore , behold , the days come , sa@@ ith the LORD , that I will do judgment upon her gra@@ ven images : and through all her land the wounded shall gro@@ an .
a sound of a cry com@@ eth from Babylon , and great destruction from the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans :
because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon , and destroyed out of her the great voice ; when her waves do ro@@ ar like great waters , a noise of their voice is uttered :
because the spo@@ iler is come upon her , even upon Babylon , and her mighty men are taken , every one of their b@@ ows is broken : for the LORD God of re@@ comp@@ ences shall surely requ@@ ite .
and I will make drunk her princes , and her wise men , her cap@@ tains , and her rulers , and her mighty men : and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake , sa@@ ith the King , whose name is the LORD of hosts .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts ; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken , and her high gates shall be burned with fire ; and the people shall labour in vain , and the folk in the fire , and they shall be weary .
the word which Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet commanded Ser@@ aiah the son of N@@ eri@@ ah , the son of Ma@@ as@@ ei@@ ah , when he went with Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah the king of Jud@@ ah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign . and this Ser@@ aiah was a quiet prince .
then shalt thou say , O LORD , thou hast spoken against this place , to cut it off , that none shall remain in it , neither man nor beast , but that it shall be des@@ ol@@ ate for ever .
Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign , and he re@@ igned eleven years in Jerusalem . and his mother 's name was Ham@@ ut@@ al the daughter of Jer@@ emi@@ ah of Lib@@ n@@ ah .
and he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD , according to all that Je@@ ho@@ i@@ ak@@ im had done .
for through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Jud@@ ah , till he had cast them out from his presence , that Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah reb@@ elled against the king of Babylon .
and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon came , he and all his army , against Jerusalem , and pit@@ ched against it , and built for@@ ts against it round about .
but the army of the Chal@@ de@@ ans pursued after the king , and over@@ took Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah in the plains of Jer@@ ich@@ o ; and all his army was scattered from him .
and the king of Babylon sle@@ w the sons of Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah before his eyes : he sle@@ w also all the princes of Jud@@ ah in Ri@@ b@@ lah .
then he put out the eyes of Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah ; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains , and carried him to Babylon , and put him in prison till the day of his death .
now in the fifth month , in the tenth day of the month , which was the nineteenth year of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon , came Ne@@ bu@@ z@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ Ad@@ an , captain of the guard , which served the king of Babylon , into Jerusalem ,
also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD , and the bases , and the br@@ as@@ en sea that was in the house of the LORD , the Chal@@ de@@ ans brake , and carried all the brass of them to Babylon .
the cal@@ dr@@ ons also , and the sh@@ ov@@ els , and the sn@@ u@@ ff@@ ers , and the bow@@ ls , and the spo@@ ons , and all the vessels of brass where@@ with they minist@@ ered , took they away .
and the bas@@ ons , and the fire@@ p@@ ans , and the bow@@ ls , and the cal@@ dr@@ ons , and the cand@@ les@@ tic@@ ks , and the spo@@ ons , and the cups ; that which was of gold in gold , and that which was of silver in silver , took the captain of the guard away .
the two pillars , one sea , and twelve br@@ as@@ en bul@@ ls that were under the bases , which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD : the brass of all these vessels was without weight .
and concerning the pillars , the height of one pillar was eighteen cub@@ its ; and a fil@@ let of twelve cub@@ its did compass it ; and the thickness thereof was four fingers : it was hollow .
and a chap@@ iter of brass was upon it ; and the height of one chap@@ iter was five cub@@ its , with network and p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates upon the chap@@ it@@ ers round about , all of brass . the second pillar also and the p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ates were like unto these .
so Ne@@ bu@@ z@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ Ad@@ an the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of Babylon to Ri@@ b@@ lah .
and the king of Babylon smo@@ te them , and put them to death in Ri@@ b@@ lah in the land of Ham@@ ath . thus Jud@@ ah was carried away captive out of his own land .
this is the people whom Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ zz@@ ar carried away captive : in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty :
and for his diet , there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon , every day a portion until the day of his death , all the days of his life .
she we@@ ep@@ eth sore in the night , and her tears are on her cheeks : among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her : all her friends have dealt treach@@ er@@ ously with her , they are become her enemies .
Jud@@ ah is gone into cap@@ tivity because of afflic@@ tion , and because of great serv@@ itude : she dwell@@ eth among the he@@ a@@ then , she fin@@ det@@ h no rest : all her persec@@ utors over@@ took her between the stra@@ its .
the ways of Z@@ ion do mour@@ n , because none come to the solemn fe@@ asts : all her gates are des@@ ol@@ ate : her priests sigh , her vir@@ gins are afflicted , and she is in bitterness .
and from the daughter of Z@@ ion all her beauty is departed : her princes are become like har@@ ts that find no past@@ ure , and they are gone without strength before the pursu@@ er .
all her people sigh , they seek bread ; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul : see , O LORD , and consider ; for I am become v@@ ile .
from above hath he sent fire into my bones , and it prev@@ ail@@ eth against them : he hath spread a net for my feet , he hath turned me back : he hath made me des@@ ol@@ ate and faint all the day .
for these things I we@@ ep ; mine eye , mine eye run@@ neth down with water , because the comfor@@ ter that should relieve my soul is far from me : my children are des@@ ol@@ ate , because the enemy prevailed .
Z@@ ion spread@@ eth forth her hands , and there is none to comfort her : the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob , that his adversaries should be round about him : Jerusalem is as a menstr@@ uous woman among them .
the LORD is righteous ; for I have reb@@ elled against his commandment : hear , I pray you , all people , and behold my sorrow : my vir@@ gins and my young men are gone into cap@@ tivity .
I called for my lovers , but they deceived me : my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city , while they sought their meat to relieve their souls .
how hath the Lord covered the daughter of Z@@ ion with a cloud in his anger , and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel , and remembered not his foot@@ stool in the day of his anger !
he hath bent his bow like an enemy : he stood with his right hand as an adversary , and sle@@ w all that were pleasant to the eye in the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the daughter of Z@@ ion : he poured out his fury like fire .
her gates are sunk into the ground ; he hath destroyed and broken her bars : her king and her princes are among the Genti@@ les : the law is no more ; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD .
they say to their mothers , Where is corn and wine ? when they sw@@ o@@ oned as the wounded in the streets of the city , when their soul was poured out into their mothers ' bos@@ om .
thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee : and they have not discovered th@@ ine ini@@ qu@@ ity , to turn away thy cap@@ tivity ; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of ban@@ ishment .
all that pass by cl@@ ap their hands at thee ; they h@@ iss and wa@@ g their head at the daughter of Jerusalem , saying , Is this the city that men call The perfection of beauty , The joy of the whole earth ?
all th@@ ine enemies have opened their mouth against thee : they h@@ iss and gn@@ ash the teeth : they say , We have swallowed her up : certainly this is the day that we looked for ; we have found , we have seen it .
their heart cried unto the Lord , O wall of the daughter of Z@@ ion , let tears run down like a river day and night : give thy@@ self no rest ; let not the apple of th@@ ine eye cease .
the young and the old lie on the ground in the streets : my vir@@ gins and my young men are fallen by the sword ; thou hast sl@@ ain them in the day of th@@ ine anger ; thou hast killed , and not p@@ iti@@ ed .
he hath hed@@ ged me about , that I C@@ AN@@ NOT get out : he hath made my chain heavy .
it is of the LORD 's mer@@ cies that we are not consumed , because his comp@@ as@@ sions fail not .
thou hast covered with anger , and persecuted us : thou hast sl@@ ain , thou hast not p@@ iti@@ ed .
the precious sons of Z@@ ion , comparable to fine gold , how are they este@@ em@@ ed as ear@@ then p@@ itch@@ ers , the work of the hands of the pot@@ ter !
the tongue of the su@@ cking child cle@@ av@@ eth to the roof of his mouth for thirst : the young children ask bread , and no man break@@ eth it unto them .
their vis@@ age is bl@@ acker than a coal ; they are not known in the streets : their skin cle@@ av@@ eth to their bones ; it is with@@ ered , it is become like a stick .
the hands of the p@@ iti@@ ful women have so@@ dden their own children : they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
for the sins of her prophets , and the ini@@ qu@@ ities of her priests , that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her ,
they have wan@@ dered as blind men in the streets , they have polluted themselves with blood , so that men could not touch their garments .
as for us , our eyes as yet failed for our vain help : in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us .
our persec@@ utors are swif@@ ter than the eag@@ les of the heaven : they pursued us upon the mountains , they laid wait for us in the wilderness .
the punishment of th@@ ine ini@@ qu@@ ity is accomplished , O daughter of Z@@ ion ; he will no more carry thee away into cap@@ tivity : he will visit th@@ ine ini@@ qu@@ ity , O daughter of E@@ dom ; he will discover thy sins .
servants have ruled over us : there is none that do@@ th deliver us out of their hand .
we G@@ at our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness .
now it came to pass in the thir@@ ti@@ eth year , in the fourth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I was among the cap@@ tives by the river of Che@@ bar , that the heavens were opened , and I saw visions of God .
the word of the LORD came expressly unto E@@ ze@@ ki@@ el the priest , the son of Bu@@ zi , in the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans by the river Che@@ bar ; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him .
and their feet were straight feet ; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a cal@@ f 's foot : and they spark@@ led like the colour of bur@@ nished brass .
the appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a ber@@ yl : and they four had one lik@@ eness : and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel .
as for their rings , they were so high that they were dreadful ; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four .
and when the living creatures went , the wheels went by them : and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up .
W@@ hi@@ ther@@ soever the spirit was to go , they went , thi@@ ther was their spirit to go ; and the wheels were lifted up over against them : for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
when those went , these went ; and when those stood , these stood ; and when those were lifted up from the earth , the wheels were lifted up over against them : for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels .
and under the firm@@ ament were their wings straight , the one toward the other : every one had two , which covered on this side , and every one had two , which covered on that side , their bodies .
and when they went , I heard the noise of their wings , like the noise of great waters , as the voice of the Almighty , the voice of speech , as the noise of an host : when they stood , they let down their wings .
and above the firm@@ ament that was over their heads was the lik@@ eness of a throne , as the appearance of a s@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire stone : and upon the lik@@ eness of the throne was the lik@@ eness as the appearance of a man above upon it .
and he said unto me , Son of man , I send thee to the children of Israel , to a rebelli@@ ous nation that hath reb@@ elled against me : they and their fathers have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me , even unto this very day .
and thou shalt speak my words unto them , whether they will hear , or whether they will for@@ bear : for they are most rebelli@@ ous .
and when I looked , behold , an hand was sent unto me ; and , lo , a roll of a book was therein ;
and he said unto me , Son of man , cause thy belly to eat , and fill thy bow@@ els with this roll that I give thee . then did I eat it ; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweet@@ ness .
and he said unto me , Son of man , go , get thee unto the house of Israel , and speak with my words unto them .
for thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language , but to the house of Israel ;
moreover he said unto me , Son of man , all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in th@@ ine heart , and hear with th@@ ine ears .
and go , get thee to them of the cap@@ tivity , unto the children of thy people , and speak unto them , and tell them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; whether they will hear , or whether they will for@@ bear .
then the spirit took me up , and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing , saying , Bless@@ ed be the glory of the LORD from his place .
so the spirit lifted me up , and took me away , and I went in bitterness , in the heat of my spirit ; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me .
then I came to them of the cap@@ tivity at Tel @@@ -@@ @ ab@@ ib , that d@@ wel@@ t by the river of Che@@ bar , and I sat where they sat , and remained there astonished among them seven days .
son of man , I have made thee a watch@@ man unto the house of Israel : therefore hear the word at my mouth , and give them warning from me .
and the hand of the LORD was there upon me ; and he said unto me , A@@ rise , go forth into the plain , and I will there talk with thee .
then I arose , and went forth into the plain : and , behold , the glory of the LORD stood there , as the glory which I saw by the river of Che@@ bar : and I fell on my face .
but thou , O son of man , behold , they shall put bands upon thee , and shall bind thee with them , and thou shalt not go out among them :
and I will make thy tongue cle@@ ave to the roof of thy mouth , that thou shalt be dumb , and shalt not be to them a repro@@ ver : for they are a rebelli@@ ous house .
thou also , son of man , take thee a tile , and lay it before thee , and p@@ our@@ tray upon it the city , even Jerusalem :
lie thou also upon thy left side , and lay the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the house of Israel upon it : according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their ini@@ qu@@ ity .
therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem , and th@@ ine arm shall be uncovered , and thou shalt proph@@ esy against it .
and , behold , I will lay bands upon thee , and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another , till thou hast ended the days of thy siege .
thou shalt drink also water by measure , the sixth part of an H@@ in : from time to time shalt thou drink .
moreover he said unto me , Son of man , behold , I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem : and they shall eat bread by weight , and with care ; and they shall drink water by measure , and with aston@@ ishment :
and thou , son of man , take thee a sharp knife , take thee a bar@@ ber 's r@@ as@@ or , and cause it to pass upon th@@ ine head and upon thy beard : then take thee balances to weight , and divide the hair .
then take of them again , and cast them into the midst of the fire , and burn them in the fire ; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; This is Jerusalem : I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her .
and she hath changed my judgments into w@@ ick@@ edness more than the nations , and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her : for they have refused my judgments and my statutes , they have not walked in them .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Be@@ hold , I , even I , am against thee , and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations .
therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee , and the sons shall eat their fathers ; and I will execute judgments in thee , and the whole remn@@ ant of thee will I sc@@ atter into all the winds .
thus shall mine anger be accomplished , and I will cause my fury to rest upon them , and I will be comfor@@ ted : and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal , when I have accomplished my fury in them .
so it shall be a repro@@ ach and a ta@@ unt , an instruction and an aston@@ ishment unto the nations that are round about thee , when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebu@@ kes . I the LORD have spoken it .
when I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine , which shall be for their destruction , and which I will send to destroy you : and I will increase the famine upon you , and will break your staff of bread :
so will I send upon you famine and evil beasts , and they shall ber@@ e@@ ave thee ; and pesti@@ l@@ ence and blood shall pass through thee ; and I will bring the sword upon thee . I the LORD have spoken it .
and the sl@@ ain shall fall in the midst of you , and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
yet will I leave a remn@@ ant , that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations , when ye shall be scattered through the countries .
and they shall know that I am the LORD , and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Sm@@ ite with th@@ ine hand , and stamp with thy foot , and say , Al@@ as for all the evil ab@@ om@@ inations of the house of Israel ! for they shall fall by the sword , by the famine , and by the pesti@@ l@@ ence .
he that is far off shall die of the pesti@@ l@@ ence ; and he that is near shall fall by the sword ; and he that remain@@ eth and is be@@ sieg@@ ed shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my fury upon them .
so will I stretch out my hand upon them , and make the land des@@ ol@@ ate , ye@@ a , more des@@ ol@@ ate than the wilderness toward Di@@ bl@@ ath , in all their hab@@ itations : and they shall know that I am the LORD .
also , thou son of man , thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D unto the land of Israel ; An end , the end is come upon the four corners of the land .
now is the end come upon thee , and I will send mine anger upon thee , and will judge thee according to thy ways , and will re@@ comp@@ ense upon thee all th@@ ine ab@@ om@@ inations .
and mine eye shall not spare thee , neither will I have pity : but I will re@@ comp@@ ense thy ways upon thee , and th@@ ine ab@@ om@@ inations shall be in the midst of thee : and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee , and accomplish mine anger upon thee : and I will judge thee according to thy ways , and will re@@ comp@@ ense thee for all th@@ ine ab@@ om@@ inations .
and mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : I will re@@ comp@@ ense thee according to thy ways and th@@ ine ab@@ om@@ inations that are in the midst of thee ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD that sm@@ it@@ eth .
the time is come , the day draw@@ eth near : let not the buyer rejoice , nor the seller mour@@ n : for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof .
for the seller shall not return to that which is sold , although they were yet alive : for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof , which shall not return ; neither shall any strengthen himself in the ini@@ qu@@ ity of his life .
they have blown the trum@@ pet , even to make all ready ; but none go@@ eth to the battle : for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof .
the sword is without , and the pesti@@ l@@ ence and the famine within : he that is in the field shall die with the sword ; and he that is in the city , famine and pesti@@ l@@ ence shall dev@@ our him .
but they that escape of them shall escape , and shall be on the mountains like d@@ oves of the valleys , all of them mourning , every one for his ini@@ qu@@ ity .
as for the beauty of his or@@ nament , he set it in maj@@ esty : but they made the images of their ab@@ om@@ inations and of their det@@ est@@ able things therein : therefore have I set it far from them .
my face will I turn also from them , and they shall poll@@ ute my secret place : for the rob@@ bers shall enter into it , and def@@ ile it .
make a chain : for the land is full of bloody crimes , and the city is full of violence .
mis@@ chief shall come upon mis@@ chief , and rum@@ our shall be upon rum@@ our ; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet ; but the law shall perish from the priest , and counsel from the anci@@ ents .
and it came to pass in the sixth year , in the sixth month , in the fifth day of the month , as I sat in mine house , and the elders of Jud@@ ah sat before me , that the hand of the Lord GO@@ D fell there upon me .
then I be@@ held , and lo a lik@@ eness as the appearance of fire : from the appearance of his lo@@ ins even downward , fire ; and from his lo@@ ins even upward , as the appearance of brightness , as the colour of amber .
and , behold , the glory of the God of Israel was there , according to the vision that I saw in the plain .
then said he unto me , Son of man , lift up th@@ ine eyes now the way toward the north . so I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north , and behold nor@@ th@@ ward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry .
he said furthermore unto me , Son of man , se@@ est thou what they do ? even the great ab@@ om@@ inations that the house of Israel commit@@ t@@ eth here , that I should go far off from my sanctuary ? but turn thee yet again , and thou shalt see greater ab@@ om@@ inations .
then said he unto me , Son of man , dig now in the wall : and when I had di@@ gged in the wall , behold a door .
so I went in and saw ; and behold every form of cre@@ eping things , and ab@@ om@@ in@@ able beasts , and all the idols of the house of Israel , p@@ our@@ tr@@ ayed upon the wall round about .
and there stood before them seventy men of the anci@@ ents of the house of Israel , and in the midst of them stood Ja@@ az@@ ani@@ ah the son of Sha@@ ph@@ an , with every man his cen@@ ser in his hand ; and a thick cloud of inc@@ ense went up .
then said he unto me , Son of man , hast thou seen what the anci@@ ents of the house of Israel do in the dark , every man in the chambers of his imagery ? for they say , The LORD se@@ eth us not ; the LORD hath for@@ s@@ aken the earth .
then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD 's house which was toward the north ; and , behold , there sat women we@@ eping for Tam@@ mu@@ z .
therefore will I also deal in fury : mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice , yet will I not hear them .
he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice , saying , C@@ ause them that have charge over the city to draw near , even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand .
and the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cher@@ u@@ b , where@@ upon he was , to the threshold of the house . and he called to the man clo@@ thed with linen , which had the writer 's ink@@ horn by his side ;
and to the others he said in mine hearing , Go ye after him through the city , and sm@@ ite : let not your eye spare , neither have ye pity :
and he said unto them , Def@@ ile the house , and fill the courts with the sl@@ ain : go ye forth . and they went forth , and sle@@ w in the city .
and it came to pass , while they were sl@@ aying them , and I was left , that I fell upon my face , and cried , and said , Ah Lord GO@@ D ! wil@@ t thou destroy all the resi@@ due of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem ?
then said he unto me , The ini@@ qu@@ ity of the house of Israel and Jud@@ ah is exceeding great , and the land is full of blood , and the city full of per@@ vers@@ eness : for they say , The LORD hath for@@ s@@ aken the earth , and the LORD se@@ eth not .
then I looked , and , behold , in the firm@@ ament that was above the head of the cher@@ ub@@ ims there appeared over them as it were a s@@ ap@@ ph@@ ire stone , as the appearance of the lik@@ eness of a throne .
now the cher@@ ub@@ ims stood on the right side of the house , when the man went in ; and the cloud filled the inner court .
and it came to pass , that when he had commanded the man clo@@ thed with linen , saying , Take fire from between the wheels , from between the cher@@ ub@@ ims ; then he went in , and stood beside the wheels .
and one cher@@ u@@ b stretched forth his hand from between the cher@@ ub@@ ims unto the fire that was between the cher@@ ub@@ ims , and took thereof , and put it into the hands of him that was clo@@ thed with linen : who took it , and went out .
and their whole body , and their backs , and their hands , and their wings , and the wheels , were full of eyes round about , even the wheels that they four had .
when they stood , these stood ; and when they were lifted up , these lifted up themselves also : for the spirit of the living creature was in them .
every one had four faces api@@ ece , and every one four wings ; and the lik@@ eness of the hands of a man was under their wings .
which say , It is not near ; let us build houses : this city is the cal@@ dr@@ on , and we be the flesh .
and the Spirit of the LORD fell upon me , and said unto me , Spe@@ ak ; Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD ; Th@@ us have ye said , O house of Israel : for I know the things that come into your mind , every one of them .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Your sl@@ ain whom ye have laid in the midst of it , they are the flesh , and this city is the cal@@ dr@@ on : but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it .
and I will bring you out of the midst thereof , and deliver you into the hands of strangers , and will execute judgments among you .
ye shall fall by the sword ; I will judge you in the border of Israel ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
this city shall not be your cal@@ dr@@ on , neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof ; but I will judge you in the border of Israel :
and ye shall know that I am the LORD : for ye have not walked in my statutes , neither executed my judgments , but have done after the manners of the he@@ a@@ then that are round about you .
therefore say , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Although I have cast them far off among the he@@ a@@ then , and although I have scattered them among the countries , yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come .
therefore say , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; I will even gather you from the people , and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered , and I will give you the land of Israel .
and I will give them one heart , and I will put a new spirit within you ; and I will take the st@@ ony heart out of their flesh , and will give them an heart of flesh :
but as for them whose heart wal@@ ket@@ h after the heart of their det@@ est@@ able things and their ab@@ om@@ inations , I will re@@ comp@@ ense their way upon their own heads , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
then did the cher@@ ub@@ ims lift up their wings , and the wheels beside them ; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above .
afterwards the spirit took me up , and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chal@@ dea , to them of the cap@@ tivity . so the vision that I had seen went up from me .
then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight , as stuff for removing : and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight , as they that go forth into cap@@ tivity .
my net also will I spread upon him , and he shall be taken in my sn@@ are : and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chal@@ de@@ ans ; yet shall he not see it , though he shall die there .
and I will sc@@ atter toward every wind all that are about him to help him , and all his bands ; and I will draw out the sword after them .
but I will leave a few men of them from the sword , from the famine , and from the pesti@@ l@@ ence ; that they may declare all their ab@@ om@@ inations among the he@@ a@@ then whi@@ ther they come ; and they shall know that I am the LORD .
tell them therefore , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; I will make this prover@@ b to cease , and they shall no more use it as a prover@@ b in Israel ; but say unto them , The days are at hand , and the effect of every vision .
for I am the LORD : I will speak , and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass ; it shall be no more prolonged : for in your days , O rebelli@@ ous house , will I say the word , and will perform it , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
son of man , behold , they of the house of Israel say , The vision that he se@@ eth is for many days to come , and he prophe@@ si@@ eth of the times that are far off .
therefore say unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more , but the word which I have spoken shall be done , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
ye have not gone up into the gaps , neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD .
they have seen van@@ ity and lying div@@ ination , saying , The LORD sa@@ ith : and the LORD hath not sent them : and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word .
have ye not seen a vain vision , and have ye not spoken a lying div@@ ination , whereas ye say , The LORD sa@@ ith it ; albeit I have not spoken ?
say unto them which dau@@ b it with un@@ tempered mor@@ ter , that it shall fall : there shall be an over@@ flowing shower ; and ye , O great ha@@ il@@ stones , shall fall ; and a stor@@ my wind shall ren@@ d it .
and will ye poll@@ ute me among my people for hand@@ ful@@ s of barley and for pieces of bread , to sl@@ ay the souls that should not die , and to save the souls alive that should not live , by your lying to my people that hear your lies ?
your ker@@ chiefs also will I tear , and deliver my people out of your hand , and they shall be no more in your hand to be hun@@ ted ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the wicked , that he should not return from his wicked way , by promising him life :
son of man , these men have set up their idols in their heart , and put the stum@@ bl@@ ing@@ block of their ini@@ qu@@ ity before their face : should I be inqui@@ red of at all by them ?
therefore say unto the house of Israel , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Rep@@ ent , and turn yourselves from your idols ; and turn away your faces from all your ab@@ om@@ inations .
and I will set my face against that man , and will make him a sign and a prover@@ b , and I will cut him off from the midst of my people ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
and if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing , I the LORD have deceived that prophet , and I will stretch out my hand upon him , and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel .
that the house of Israel may go no more astr@@ ay from me , neither be polluted any more with all their trans@@ gres@@ sions ; but that they may be my people , and I may be their God , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
if I cause nois@@ ome beasts to pass through the land , and they spoil it , so that it be des@@ ol@@ ate , that no man may pass through because of the beasts :
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem , the sword , and the famine , and the nois@@ ome beast , and the pesti@@ l@@ ence , to cut off from it man and beast ?
and they shall comfort you , when ye see their ways and their do@@ ings : and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
behold , it is cast into the fire for fuel ; the fire dev@@ ou@@ re@@ th both the ends of it , and the midst of it is burned . is it meet for any work ?
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest , which I have given to the fire for fuel , so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem .
and I will set my face against them ; they shall go out from one fire , and another fire shall dev@@ our them ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD , when I set my face against them .
and say , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D unto Jerusalem ; Th@@ y birth and thy n@@ ativity is of the land of Can@@ a@@ an ; thy father was an A@@ mor@@ ite , and thy mother an Hit@@ tite .
none eye p@@ iti@@ ed thee , to do any of these unto thee , to have compassion upon thee ; but thou w@@ ast cast out in the open field , to the lo@@ thing of thy person , in the day that thou w@@ ast born .
I clo@@ thed thee also with bro@@ i@@ dered work , and sh@@ od thee with Bad@@ gers ' skin , and I gir@@ ded thee about with fine linen , and I covered thee with silk .
but thou did@@ st trust in th@@ ine own beauty , and play@@ ed@@ st the har@@ lot because of thy renow@@ n , and p@@ ou@@ red@@ st out thy for@@ n@@ ications on every one that passed by ; his it was .
and of thy garments thou did@@ st take , and dec@@ k@@ ed@@ st thy high places with divers colours , and play@@ ed@@ st the har@@ lot there@@ upon : the like things shall not come , neither shall it be so .
thou hast also taken thy fair jew@@ els of my gold and of my silver , which I had given thee , and mad@@ est to thy@@ self images of men , and did@@ st commit wh@@ ore@@ dom with them ,
moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters , whom thou hast borne unto me , and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be dev@@ oured . is this of thy wh@@ ore@@ doms a small matter ,
that thou hast sl@@ ain my children , and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them ?
and it came to pass after all thy w@@ ick@@ edness , ( w@@ oe , w@@ oe unto thee ! sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; )
thou hast also committed for@@ n@@ ication with the Egyptians thy neighbours , great of flesh ; and hast increased thy wh@@ ore@@ doms , to provoke me to anger .
behold , therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee , and have diminished th@@ ine ordinary food , and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee , the daughters of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , which are ashamed of thy le@@ w@@ d way .
thou hast moreover multiplied thy for@@ n@@ ication in the land of Can@@ a@@ an unto Chal@@ dea ; and yet thou w@@ ast not satisfied here@@ with .
in that thou buil@@ dest th@@ ine eminent place in the head of every way , and mak@@ est th@@ ine high place in every street ; and hast not been as an har@@ lot , in that thou scor@@ nest hire ;
and I will judge thee , as women that break wed@@ lock and shed blood are judged ; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy .
and I will also give thee into their hand , and they shall throw down th@@ ine eminent place , and shall break down thy high places : they shall strip thee also of thy clothes , and shall take thy fair jew@@ els , and leave thee naked and bare .
so will I make my fury toward thee to rest , and my jealousy shall depart from thee , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
yet hast thou not walked after their ways , nor done after their ab@@ om@@ inations : but , as if that were a very little thing , thou w@@ ast corrupted more than they in all thy ways .
behold , this was the ini@@ qu@@ ity of thy sister So@@ dom , pride , fulness of bread , and abundance of id@@ l@@ eness was in her and in her daughters , neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and ne@@ edy .
before thy w@@ ick@@ edness was discovered , as at the time of thy repro@@ ach of the daughters of Syria , and all that are round about her , the daughters of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , which desp@@ ise thee round about .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done , which hast desp@@ ised the oath in breaking the covenant .
nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth , and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant .
and say , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; A great eagle with great wings , long@@ wing@@ ed , full of fe@@ athers , which had divers colours , came unto Lebanon , and took the highest branch of the c@@ edar :
he took also of the seed of the land , and planted it in a fruitful field ; he placed it by great waters , and set it as a wil@@ low tree .
there was also another great eagle with great wings and many fe@@ athers : and , behold , this vine did bend her roots toward him , and shot forth her branches toward him , that he might water it by the fur@@ rows of her plantation .
it was planted in a good soil by great waters , that it might bring forth branches , and that it might bear fruit , that it might be a goo@@ dly vine .
say now to the rebelli@@ ous house , Know ye not what these things mean ? tell them , Be@@ hold , the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem , and hath taken the king thereof , and the princes thereof , and led them with him to Babylon ;
and hath taken of the king 's seed , and made a covenant with him , and hath taken an oath of him : he hath also taken the mighty of the land :
that the kingdom might be base , that it might not lift itself up , but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand .
as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D , surely in the place where the king dwell@@ eth that made him king , whose oath he desp@@ ised , and whose covenant he brake , even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die .
seeing he desp@@ ised the oath by breaking the covenant , when , lo , he had given his hand , and hath done all these things , he shall not escape .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; As I live , surely mine oath that he hath desp@@ ised , and my covenant that he hath broken , even it will I re@@ comp@@ ense upon his own head .
and I will spread my net upon him , and he shall be taken in my sn@@ are , and I will bring him to Babylon , and will ple@@ ad with him there for his t@@ resp@@ ass that he hath t@@ resp@@ assed against me .
and all his fu@@ gi@@ tives with all his bands shall fall by the sword , and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds : and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken it .
in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it : and it shall bring forth b@@ ough@@ s , and bear fruit , and be a goo@@ dly c@@ edar : and under it shall dwell all f@@ owl of every wing ; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell .
what mean ye , that ye use this prover@@ b concerning the land of Israel , saying , The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children 's teeth are set on edge ?
as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D , ye shall not have occasion any more to use this prover@@ b in Israel .
behold , all souls are mine ; as the soul of the father , so also the soul of the son is mine : the soul that sin@@ neth , it shall die .
and hath not eaten upon the mountains , neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , neither hath de@@ filed his neighbour 's wife , neither hath come near to a menstr@@ uous woman ,
he that hath not given forth upon us@@ ury , neither hath taken any increase , that hath withdrawn his hand from ini@@ qu@@ ity , hath executed true judgment between man and man ,
hath walked in my statutes , and hath kept my judgments , to deal truly ; he is just , he shall surely live , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
if he be@@ get a son that is a rob@@ ber , a sh@@ ed@@ der of blood , and that do@@ eth the like to any one of these things ,
hath oppressed the poor and ne@@ edy , hath spoiled by violence , hath not restored the pledge , and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols , hath committed ab@@ om@@ ination ,
neither hath oppressed any , hath not with@@ hol@@ den the pledge , neither hath spoiled by violence , but hath given his bread to the hungry , and hath covered the naked with a garment ,
that hath taken off his hand from the poor , that hath not received us@@ ury nor increase , hath executed my judgments , hath walked in my statutes ; he shall not die for the ini@@ qu@@ ity of his father , he shall surely live .
yet say ye , Why ? do@@ th not the son bear the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the father ? when the son hath done that which is lawful and right , and hath kept all my statutes , and hath done them , he shall surely live .
but if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed , and keep all my statutes , and do that which is lawful and right , he shall surely live , he shall not die .
have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die ? sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D : and not that he should return from his ways , and live ?
yet ye say , The way of the Lord is not equal . hear now , O house of Israel ; Is not my way equal ? are not your ways unequal ?
again , when the wicked man tur@@ neth away from his w@@ ick@@ edness that he hath committed , and do@@ eth that which is lawful and right , he shall save his soul alive .
yet sa@@ ith the house of Israel , The way of the Lord is not equal . O house of Israel , are not my ways equal ? are not your ways unequal ?
therefore I will judge you , O house of Israel , every one according to his ways , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D . repent , and turn yourselves from all your trans@@ gres@@ sions ; so ini@@ qu@@ ity shall not be your ruin .
cast away from you all your trans@@ gres@@ sions , whereby ye have trans@@ g@@ ressed ; and make you a new heart and a new spirit : for why will ye die , O house of Israel ?
and say , What is thy mother ? a lion@@ ess : she lay down among lions , she nourished her whel@@ ps among young lions .
and she brought up one of her whel@@ ps : it became a young lion , and it learned to catch the prey ; it dev@@ oured men .
and he went up and down among the lions , he became a young lion , and learned to catch the prey , and dev@@ oured men .
and they put him in ward in chains , and brought him to the king of Babylon : they brought him into holds , that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel .
thy mother is like a vine in thy blood , planted by the waters : she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters .
and she had strong rods for the sc@@ ept@@ res of them that bare rule , and her stature was exalted among the thick branches , and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches .
but she was pl@@ ucked up in fury , she was cast down to the ground , and the east wind dried up her fruit : her strong rods were broken and with@@ ered ; the fire consumed them .
son of man , speak unto the elders of Israel , and say unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Are ye come to inqu@@ ire of me ? as I live , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D , I will not be inqui@@ red of by you .
in the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them , to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had es@@ pied for them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands :
and I gave them my statutes , and sh@@ ew@@ ed them my judgments , which if a man do , he shall even live in them .
but I wrought for my name 's sake , that it should not be polluted before the he@@ a@@ then , in whose sight I brought them out .
yet also I lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness , that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them , flowing with milk and honey , which is the glory of all lands ;
nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them , neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness .
nevertheless I withdrew mine hand , and wrought for my name 's sake , that it should not be polluted in the sight of the he@@ a@@ then , in whose sight I brought them forth .
I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness , that I would sc@@ atter them among the he@@ a@@ then , and disper@@ se them through the countries ;
therefore , son of man , speak unto the house of Israel , and say unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Y@@ et in this your fathers have bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed me , in that they have committed a t@@ resp@@ ass against me .
and that which com@@ eth into your mind shall not be at all , that ye say , We will be as the he@@ a@@ then , as the families of the countries , to serve wood and stone .
and I will bring you into the wilderness of the people , and there will I ple@@ ad with you face to face .
like as I ple@@ aded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt , so will I ple@@ ad with you , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
as for you , O house of Israel , thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Go ye , serve ye every one his idols , and here@@ after also , if ye will not hear@@ ken unto me : but poll@@ ute ye my holy name no more with your gifts , and with your idols .
I will accept you with your sweet sav@@ our , when I bring you out from the people , and gather you out of the countries where@@ in ye have been scattered ; and I will be sancti@@ fied in you before the he@@ a@@ then .
and there shall ye remember your ways , and all your do@@ ings , where@@ in ye have been de@@ filed ; and ye shall lo@@ the yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed .
and ye shall know that I am the LORD , when I have wrought with you for my name 's sake , not according to your wicked ways , nor according to your corrupt do@@ ings , O ye house of Israel , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
and say to the land of Israel , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD ; Be@@ hold , I am against thee , and will draw forth my sword out of his she@@ ath , and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked .
seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked , therefore shall my sword go forth out of his she@@ ath against all flesh from the south to the north :
son of man , proph@@ esy , and say , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD ; S@@ ay , A sword , a sword is sharpen@@ ed , and also furb@@ ished :
it is sharpen@@ ed to make a sore slaughter ; it is furb@@ ished that it may glit@@ ter : should we then make mir@@ th ? it contem@@ neth the rod of my son , as every tree .
and he hath give it to be furb@@ ished , that it may be handled : this sword is sharpen@@ ed , and it is furb@@ ished , to give it into the hand of the s@@ layer .
cry and how@@ l , son of man : for it shall be upon my people , it shall be upon all the princes of Israel : terr@@ ors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people : sm@@ ite therefore upon thy thi@@ gh .
I have set the point of the sword against all their gates , that their heart may faint , and their ruins be multiplied : Ah ! it is made bright , it is wrapped up for the slaughter .
and it shall be unto them as a false div@@ ination in their sight , to them that have sworn o@@ aths : but he will call to rem@@ embrance the ini@@ qu@@ ity , that they may be taken .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Remove the di@@ ad@@ em , and take off the crown : this shall not be the same : ex@@ alt him that is low , and ab@@ ase him that is high .
and thou , son of man , proph@@ esy and say , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D concerning the Am@@ mon@@ ites , and concerning their repro@@ ach ; even say thou , The sword , the sword is drawn : for the slaughter it is furb@@ ished , to consume because of the glit@@ tering :
wh@@ iles they see van@@ ity unto thee , wh@@ iles they divine a lie unto thee , to bring thee upon the nec@@ ks of them that are sl@@ ain , of the wicked , whose day is come , when their ini@@ qu@@ ity shall have an end .
shall I cause it to return into his she@@ ath ? I will judge thee in the place where thou w@@ ast created , in the land of thy n@@ ativity .
and I will pour out mine indignation upon thee , I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath , and deliver thee into the hand of bru@@ tish men , and sk@@ il@@ ful to destroy .
thou shalt be for fuel to the fire ; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land ; thou shalt be no more remembered : for I the LORD have spoken it .
now , thou son of man , wil@@ t thou judge , wil@@ t thou judge the bloody city ? ye@@ a , thou shalt sh@@ ew her all her ab@@ om@@ inations .
those that be near , and those that be far from thee , shall mo@@ ck thee , which art infamous and much v@@ exed .
in thee are men that carry tales to shed blood : and in thee they eat upon the mountains : in the midst of thee they commit le@@ w@@ dness .
in thee have they discovered their fathers ' n@@ ak@@ edness : in thee have they hum@@ bled her that was set apart for pollution .
in thee have they taken gifts to shed blood ; thou hast taken us@@ ury and increase , and thou hast gre@@ ed@@ ily gained of thy neighbours by extortion , and hast forgotten me , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
son of man , the house of Israel is to me become d@@ ross : all they are brass , and tin , and iron , and lead , in the midst of the furnace ; they are even the d@@ ross of silver .
as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace , so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof ; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you .
son of man , say unto her , Th@@ ou art the land that is not cleans@@ ed , nor rained upon in the day of indignation .
her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ra@@ ven@@ ing the prey , to shed blood , and to destroy souls , to get dishonest gain .
and her prophets have da@@ ub@@ ed them with un@@ tempered mor@@ ter , seeing van@@ ity , and div@@ ining lies unto them , saying , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D , when the LORD hath not spoken .
and I sought for a man among them , that should make up the hedge , and stand in the gap before me for the land , that I should not destroy it : but I found none .
therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them ; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath : their own way have I re@@ comp@@ en@@ sed upon their heads , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
and they committed wh@@ ore@@ doms in Egypt ; they committed wh@@ ore@@ doms in their youth : there were their breasts pressed , and there they bru@@ ised the te@@ ats of their vir@@ g@@ inity .
and the names of them were A@@ hol@@ ah the elder , and A@@ hol@@ i@@ ba@@ h her sister : and they were mine , and they bare sons and daughters . thus were their names ; Sam@@ aria is A@@ hol@@ ah , and Jerusalem A@@ hol@@ i@@ ba@@ h .
neither left she her wh@@ ore@@ doms brought from Egypt : for in her youth they lay with her , and they bru@@ ised the breasts of her vir@@ g@@ inity , and poured their wh@@ ore@@ dom upon her .
and when her sister A@@ hol@@ i@@ ba@@ h saw this , she was more corrupt in her in@@ ordin@@ ate love than she , and in her wh@@ ore@@ doms more than her sister in her wh@@ ore@@ doms .
gir@@ ded with gir@@ dles upon their lo@@ ins , exceeding in dy@@ ed at@@ tire upon their heads , all of them princes to look to , after the manner of the Bab@@ yl@@ onians of Chal@@ dea , the land of their n@@ ativity :
and as soon as she saw them with her eyes , she do@@ ted upon them , and sent messengers unto them into Chal@@ dea .
and the Bab@@ yl@@ onians came to her into the bed of love , and they de@@ filed her with their wh@@ ore@@ dom , and she was polluted with them , and her mind was alienated from them .
for she do@@ ted upon their param@@ ours , whose flesh is as the flesh of asses , and whose issue is like the issue of horses .
thus thou cal@@ le@@ d@@ st to rem@@ embrance the le@@ w@@ dness of thy youth , in bru@@ ising thy te@@ ats by the Egyptians for the P@@ aps of thy youth .
there , O A@@ hol@@ i@@ ba@@ h , thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Be@@ hold , I will raise up thy lovers against thee , from whom thy mind is alienated , and I will bring them against thee on every side ;
the Bab@@ yl@@ onians , and all the Chal@@ de@@ ans , Pe@@ k@@ od , and Sho@@ a , and Ko@@ a , and all the As@@ sy@@ rians with them : all of them desirable young men , cap@@ tains and rulers , great lords and renowned , all of them riding upon horses .
thus will I make thy le@@ w@@ dness to cease from thee , and thy wh@@ ore@@ dom brought from the land of Egypt : so that thou shalt not lift up th@@ ine eyes unto them , nor remember Egypt any more .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Th@@ ou shalt drink of thy sister 's cup deep and large : thou shalt be laughed to scor@@ n and had in deri@@ sion ; it contain@@ eth much .
thou shalt be filled with drun@@ ken@@ ness and sorrow , with the cup of aston@@ ishment and des@@ ol@@ ation , with the cup of thy sister Sam@@ aria .
thou shalt even drink it and su@@ ck it out , and thou shalt break the sh@@ er@@ ds thereof , and pl@@ uck off th@@ ine own breasts : for I have spoken it , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
the LORD said moreover unto me ; Son of man , wil@@ t thou judge A@@ hol@@ ah and A@@ hol@@ i@@ ba@@ h ? ye@@ a , declare unto them their ab@@ om@@ inations ;
for when they had sl@@ ain their children to their idols , then they came the same day into my sanctuary to prof@@ ane it ; and , lo , thus have they done in the midst of mine house .
and a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her : and with the men of the common sort were brought Sab@@ e@@ ans from the wilderness , which put brac@@ elets upon their hands , and beautiful crow@@ ns upon their heads .
yet they went in unto her , as they go in unto a woman that play@@ eth the har@@ lot : so went they in unto A@@ hol@@ ah and unto A@@ hol@@ i@@ ba@@ h , the le@@ w@@ d women .
and the righteous men , they shall judge them after the manner of adul@@ ter@@ esses , and after the manner of women that shed blood ; because they are adul@@ ter@@ esses , and blood is in their hands .
and the company shall stone them with stones , and dispatch them with their s@@ words ; they shall sl@@ ay their sons and their daughters , and burn up their houses with fire .
son of man , write thee the name of the day , even of this same day : the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day .
and utter a parable unto the rebelli@@ ous house , and say unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Set on a pot , set it on , and also pour water into it :
gather the pieces thereof into it , even every good piece , the thi@@ gh , and the shoulder ; fill it with the choice bones .
take the choice of the flock , and burn also the bones under it , and make it boil well , and let them see@@ the the bones of it therein .
W@@ herefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; W@@ oe to the bloody city , to the pot whose sc@@ um is therein , and whose sc@@ um is not gone out of it ! bring it out piece by piece ; let no lot fall up on it .
for her blood is in the midst of her ; she set it upon the top of a rock ; she poured it not upon the ground , to cover it with dust ;
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; W@@ oe to the bloody city ! I will even make the pile for fire great .
heap on wood , kind@@ le the fire , consume the flesh , and sp@@ ice it well , and let the bones be burned .
then set it empty upon the co@@ als thereof , that the brass of it may be hot , and may burn , and that the fil@@ thiness of it may be mol@@ ten in it , that the sc@@ um of it may be consumed .
for@@ bear to cry , make no mourning for the dead , bind the tire of th@@ ine head upon thee , and put on thy shoes upon thy feet , and cover not thy lips , and eat not the bread of men .
also , thou son of man , shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength , the joy of their glory , the desire of their eyes , and that where@@ upon they set their minds , their sons and their daughters ,
that he that escap@@ eth in that day shall come unto thee , to cause thee to hear it with th@@ ine ears ?
in that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped , and thou shalt speak , and be no more dumb : and thou shalt be a sign unto them ; and they shall know that I am the LORD .
behold , therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession , and they shall set their palaces in thee , and make their dwell@@ ings in thee : they shall eat thy fruit , and they shall drink thy milk .
and I will make Rab@@ ba@@ h a stable for cam@@ els , and the Am@@ mon@@ ites a cou@@ ch@@ ing@@ place for f@@ locks : and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Because thou hast cl@@ apped th@@ ine hands , and stamped with the feet , and rejo@@ iced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel ;
therefore , behold , I will open the side of Mo@@ ab from the cities , from his cities which are on his frontiers , the glory of the country , B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ j@@ es@@ him@@ o@@ th , Ba@@ al @@@ -@@ @ me@@ on , and Kiri@@ ath@@ aim ,
thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Because that E@@ dom hath dealt against the house of Jud@@ ah by taking vengeance , and hath greatly offended , and rev@@ eng@@ ed himself upon them ;
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; I will also stretch out mine hand upon E@@ dom , and will cut off man and beast from it ; and I will make it des@@ ol@@ ate from Tem@@ an ; and they of D@@ ed@@ an shall fall by the sword .
and I will lay my vengeance upon E@@ dom by the hand of my people Israel : and they shall do in E@@ dom according to mine anger and according to my fury ; and they shall know my vengeance , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Be@@ hold , I will stretch out mine hand upon the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and I will cut off the Cher@@ eth@@ ims , and destroy the remn@@ ant of the sea coast .
and I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebu@@ kes ; and they shall know that I am the LORD , when I shall lay my vengeance upon them .
son of man , because that Ty@@ rus hath said against Jerusalem , A@@ ha , she is broken that was the gates of the people : she is turned unto me : I shall be replen@@ ished , now she is laid waste :
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Be@@ hold , I am against thee , O Ty@@ rus , and will cause many nations to come up against thee , as the sea caus@@ eth his waves to come up .
and her daughters which are in the field shall be sl@@ ain by the sword ; and they shall know that I am the LORD .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Be@@ hold , I will bring upon Ty@@ rus Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ re@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon , a king of kings , from the north , with horses , and with ch@@ ari@@ ots , and with hor@@ sem@@ en , and companies , and much people .
he shall sl@@ ay with the sword thy daughters in the field : and he shall make a fort against thee , and cast a mount against thee , and lift up the Buck@@ ler against thee .
and they shall make a spoil of thy riches , and make a prey of thy merchandise : and they shall break down thy walls , and destroy thy pleasant houses : and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water .
and I will make thee like the top of a rock : thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon ; thou shalt be built no more : for I the LORD have spoken it , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D to Ty@@ rus ; Sh@@ all not the is@@ les shake at the sound of thy fall , when the wounded cry , when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee ?
and they shall take up a lam@@ entation for thee , and say to thee , How art thou destroyed , that w@@ ast inhabited of seaf@@ aring men , the renowned city , which w@@ ast strong in the sea , she and her inhabitants , which cause their terror to be on all that ha@@ unt it !
now shall the is@@ les trem@@ ble in the day of thy fall ; ye@@ a , the is@@ les that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; When I shall make thee a des@@ ol@@ ate city , like the cities that are not inhabited ; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee , and great waters shall cover thee ;
I will make thee a terror , and thou shalt be no more : though thou be sought for , yet shalt thou never be found again , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
and say unto Ty@@ rus , O thou that art situ@@ ate at the entry of the sea , which art a merchant of the people for many is@@ les , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; O Ty@@ rus , thou hast said , I am of perfect beauty .
they have made all thy ship boards of f@@ ir trees of Sen@@ ir : they have taken c@@ ed@@ ars from Lebanon to make m@@ asts for thee .
of the o@@ aks of Bash@@ an have they made th@@ ine o@@ ars ; the company of the Ash@@ ur@@ ites have made thy ben@@ ches of iv@@ ory , brought out of the is@@ les of Ch@@ it@@ tim .
fine linen with bro@@ i@@ dered work from Egypt was that which thou spread@@ est forth to be thy sail ; blue and purple from the is@@ les of Elis@@ ha@@ h was that which covered thee .
they of Persia and of Lu@@ d and of Phu@@ t were in th@@ ine army , thy men of war : they han@@ ged the shield and helmet in thee ; they set forth thy com@@ eliness .
the men of Ar@@ v@@ ad with th@@ ine army were upon thy walls round about , and the G@@ amm@@ ad@@ ims were in thy towers : they han@@ ged their shi@@ elds upon thy walls round about ; they have made thy beauty perfect .
Tar@@ sh@@ ish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind of riches ; with silver , iron , tin , and lead , they traded in thy fairs .
Jav@@ an , tu@@ bal , and M@@ esh@@ ech , they were thy merchants : they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market .
the men of D@@ ed@@ an were thy merchants ; many is@@ les were the merchandise of th@@ ine hand : they brought thee for a present horns of iv@@ ory and eb@@ ony .
Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wa@@ res of thy making : they occupied in thy fairs with emer@@ al@@ ds , purple , and bro@@ i@@ dered work , and fine linen , and coral , and ag@@ ate .
Jud@@ ah , and the land of Israel , they were thy merchants : they traded in thy market wheat of Min@@ n@@ ith , and P@@ ann@@ ag , and honey , and oil , and bal@@ m .
Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wa@@ res of thy making , for the multitude of all riches ; in the wine of Hel@@ bon , and white wool .
the merchants of She@@ ba and Ra@@ am@@ ah , they were thy merchants : they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices , and with all precious stones , and gold .
these were thy merchants in all sorts of things , in blue clothes , and bro@@ i@@ dered work , and in ch@@ ests of rich app@@ arel , bound with cor@@ ds , and made of c@@ edar , among thy merchandise .
the ships of Tar@@ sh@@ ish did sing of thee in thy market : and thou w@@ ast replen@@ ished , and made very glorious in the midst of the seas .
thy rowers have brought thee into great waters : the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas .
and they shall make themselves utterly bal@@ d for thee , and gir@@ d them with s@@ ack@@ cloth , and they shall we@@ ep for thee with bitterness of heart and bitter w@@ ailing .
and in their w@@ ailing they shall take up a lam@@ entation for thee , and lam@@ ent over thee , saying , What city is like Ty@@ rus , like the destroyed in the midst of the sea ?
behold , thou art wis@@ er than Daniel ; there is no secret that they can hide from thee :
behold , therefore I will bring strangers upon thee , the terrible of the nations : and they shall draw their s@@ words against the beauty of thy wisdom , and they shall def@@ ile thy brightness .
wil@@ t thou yet say before him that s@@ lay@@ eth thee , I am God ? but thou shalt be a man , and no God , in the hand of him that s@@ lay@@ eth thee .
thou shalt die the deaths of the un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised by the hand of strangers : for I have spoken it , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
thou art the ano@@ inted cher@@ u@@ b that cover@@ eth ; and I have set thee so : thou w@@ ast upon the holy mountain of God ; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire .
by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence , and thou hast sin@@ ned : therefore I will cast thee as prof@@ ane out of the mountain of God : and I will destroy thee , O covering cher@@ u@@ b , from the midst of the stones of fire .
th@@ ine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty , thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness : I will cast thee to the ground , I will lay thee before kings , that they may behold thee .
all they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee : thou shalt be a terror , and never shalt thou be any more .
for I will send into her pesti@@ l@@ ence , and blood into her streets ; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side ; and they shall know that I am the LORD .
and there shall be no more a pr@@ icking bri@@ er unto the house of Israel , nor any griev@@ ing thor@@ n of all that are round about them , that desp@@ ised them ; and they shall know that I am the Lord GO@@ D .
and they shall dwell safely therein , and shall build houses , and plant vineyards ; ye@@ a , they shall dwell with confidence , when I have executed judgments upon all those that desp@@ ise them round about them ; and they shall know that I am the LORD their God .
but I will put hoo@@ ks in thy j@@ aws , and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales , and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers , and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales .
and all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the LORD , because they have been a staff of re@@ ed to the house of Israel .
when they took hold of thee by thy hand , thou did@@ st break , and ren@@ d all their shoulder : and when they leaned upon thee , thou br@@ ak@@ est , and mad@@ est all their lo@@ ins to be at a stand .
and the land of Egypt shall be des@@ ol@@ ate and waste ; and they shall know that I am the LORD : because he hath said , The river is mine , and I have made it .
behold , therefore I am against thee , and against thy rivers , and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and des@@ ol@@ ate , from the tower of Sy@@ ene even unto the border of Ethiopia .
it shall be the bas@@ est of the king@@ doms ; neither shall it ex@@ alt itself any more above the nations : for I will diminish them , that they shall no more rule over the nations .
and it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel , which br@@ ing@@ eth their ini@@ qu@@ ity to rem@@ embrance , when they shall look after them : but they shall know that I am the Lord GO@@ D .
and the sword shall come upon Egypt , and great pain shall be in Ethiopia , when the sl@@ ain shall fall in Egypt , and they shall take away her multitude , and her foundations shall be broken down .
Ethiopia , and Libya , and Ly@@ dia , and all the ming@@ led people , and Chu@@ b , and the men of the land that is in league , shall fall with them by the sword .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; They also that uphold Egypt shall fall ; and the pride of her power shall come down : from the tower of Sy@@ ene shall they fall in it by the sword , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
and they shall know that I am the LORD , when I have set a fire in Egypt , and when all her help@@ ers shall be destroyed .
in that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the ca@@ reless Ethiop@@ ians afraid , and great pain shall come upon them , as in the day of Egypt : for , lo , it com@@ eth .
he and his people with him , the terrible of the nations , shall be brought to destroy the land : and they shall draw their s@@ words against Egypt , and fill the land with the sl@@ ain .
and I will make P@@ ath@@ ros des@@ ol@@ ate , and will set fire in Zo@@ an , and will execute judgments in No .
and I will pour my fury upon S@@ in , the strength of Egypt ; and I will cut off the multitude of No .
and I will set fire in Egypt : sin shall have great pain , and No shall be rent as@@ under , and N@@ op@@ h shall have dist@@ resses daily .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Be@@ hold , I am against Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt , and will break his arms , the strong , and that which was broken ; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand .
and I will sc@@ atter the Egyptians among the nations , and will disper@@ se them through the countries .
and I will sc@@ atter the Egyptians among the nations , and disper@@ se them among the countries ; and they shall know that I am the LORD .
behold , the As@@ sy@@ rian was a c@@ edar in Lebanon with fair branches , and with a shad@@ owing shrou@@ d , and of an high stature ; and his top was among the thick b@@ ough@@ s .
all the f@@ ow@@ ls of heaven made their ne@@ sts in his b@@ ough@@ s , and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young , and under his shadow d@@ wel@@ t all great nations .
the c@@ ed@@ ars in the garden of God could not hide him : the f@@ ir trees were not like his b@@ ough@@ s , and the ch@@ est@@ nut trees were not like his branches ; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Because thou hast lifted up thy@@ self in height , and he hath shot up his top among the thick b@@ ough@@ s , and his heart is lifted up in his height ;
I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the he@@ a@@ then ; he shall surely deal with him : I have driven him out for his w@@ ick@@ edness .
they also went down into hell with him unto them that be sl@@ ain with the sword ; and they that were his arm , that d@@ wel@@ t under his shadow in the midst of the he@@ a@@ then .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people ; and they shall bring thee up in my net .
I will also ve@@ x the hearts of many people , when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations , into the countries which thou hast not known .
ye@@ a , I will make many people amazed at thee , and their kings shall be horri@@ bly afraid for thee , when I shall bran@@ dish my sword before them ; and they shall trem@@ ble at every moment , every man for his own life , in the day of thy fall .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee .
I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters ; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more , nor the hoo@@ fs of beasts trouble them .
when I shall make the land of Egypt des@@ ol@@ ate , and the country shall be des@@ tit@@ ute of that where@@ of it was full , when I shall sm@@ ite all them that dwell therein , then shall they know that I am the LORD .
this is the lam@@ entation where@@ with they shall lam@@ ent her : the daughters of the nations shall lam@@ ent her : they shall lam@@ ent for her , even for Egypt , and for all her multitude , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
the strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him : they are gone down , they lie un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , sl@@ ain by the sword .
whose graves are set in the sides of the pit , and her company is round about her grave : all of them sl@@ ain , fallen by the sword , which caused terror in the land of the living .
there is M@@ esh@@ ech , tu@@ bal , and all her multitude : her graves are round about him : all of them un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised , sl@@ ain by the sword , though they caused their terror in the land of the living .
Phar@@ aoh shall see them , and shall be comfor@@ ted over all his multitude , even Phar@@ aoh and all his army sl@@ ain by the sword , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
so thou , O son of man , I have set thee a watch@@ man unto the house of Israel ; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth , and warn them from me .
therefore , O thou son of man , speak unto the house of Israel ; Th@@ us ye speak , saying , If our trans@@ gres@@ sions and our sins be upon us , and we pine away in them , how should we then live ?
again , when I say unto the wicked , Th@@ ou shalt surely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is lawful and right ;
yet ye say , The way of the Lord is not equal . O ye house of Israel , I will judge you every one after his ways .
and it came to pass in the twel@@ fth year of our cap@@ tivity , in the tenth month , in the fifth day of the month , that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me , saying , The city is sm@@ it@@ ten .
W@@ herefore say unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Y@@ e eat with the blood , and lift up your eyes toward your idols , and shed blood : and shall ye possess the land ?
ye stand upon your sword , ye work ab@@ om@@ ination , and ye def@@ ile every one his neighbour 's wife : and shall ye possess the land ?
for I will lay the land most des@@ ol@@ ate , and the pom@@ p of her strength shall cease ; and the mountains of Israel shall be des@@ ol@@ ate , that none shall pass through .
then shall they know that I am the LORD , when I have laid the land most des@@ ol@@ ate because of all their ab@@ om@@ inations which they have committed .
son of man , proph@@ esy against the shep@@ herds of Israel , proph@@ esy , and say unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D unto the shep@@ herds ; W@@ oe be to the shep@@ herds of Israel that do feed themselves ! should not the shep@@ herds feed the f@@ locks ?
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Be@@ hold , I , even I , will both search my sheep , and seek them out .
and I will bring them out from the people , and gather them from the countries , and will bring them to their own land , and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers , and in all the inhabited places of the country .
I will feed them in a good past@@ ure , and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie in a good fold , and in a fat past@@ ure shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel .
I will feed my flock , and I will cause them to lie down , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
and as for my flock , they eat that which ye have tro@@ dden with your feet ; and they drink that which ye have f@@ ou@@ led with your feet .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D unto them ; Be@@ hold , I , even I , will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle .
and I will set up one shepherd over them , and he shall feed them , even my servant David ; he shall feed them , and he shall be their shepherd .
and they shall no more be a prey to the he@@ a@@ then , neither shall the beast of the land dev@@ our them ; but they shall dwell safely , and none shall make them afraid .
thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them , and that they , even the house of Israel , are my people , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
and say unto it , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Be@@ hold , O mount Se@@ ir , I am against thee , and I will stretch out mine hand against thee , and I will make thee most des@@ ol@@ ate .
I will lay thy cities waste , and thou shalt be des@@ ol@@ ate , and thou shalt know that I am the LORD .
and I will fill his mountains with his sl@@ ain men : in thy hills , and in thy valleys , and in all thy rivers , shall they fall that are sl@@ ain with the sword .
and thou shalt know that I am the LORD , and that I have heard all thy bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel , saying , They are laid des@@ ol@@ ate , they are given us to consume .
thus with your mouth ye have bo@@ asted against me , and have multiplied your words against me : I have heard them .
as thou did@@ st rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel , because it was des@@ ol@@ ate , so will I do unto thee : thou shalt be des@@ ol@@ ate , O mount Se@@ ir , and all I@@ dum@@ ea , even all of it : and they shall know that I am the LORD .
also , thou son of man , proph@@ esy unto the mountains of Israel , and say , Y@@ e mountains of Israel , hear the word of the LORD :
but ye , O mountains of Israel , ye shall shoot forth your branches , and yield your fruit to my people of Israel ; for they are at hand to come .
ye@@ a , I will cause men to walk upon you , even my people Israel ; and they shall possess thee , and thou shalt be their inheritance , and thou shalt no more h@@ ence@@ forth ber@@ e@@ ave them of men .
neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the he@@ a@@ then any more , neither shalt thou bear the repro@@ ach of the people any more , neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
son of man , when the house of Israel d@@ wel@@ t in their own land , they de@@ filed it by their own way and by their do@@ ings : their way was before me as the un@@ clean@@ ness of a removed woman .
and I scattered them among the he@@ a@@ then , and they were dispersed through the countries : according to their way and according to their do@@ ings I judged them .
and when they entered unto the he@@ a@@ then , whi@@ ther they went , they prof@@ an@@ ed my holy name , when they said to them , These are the people of the LORD , and are gone forth out of his land .
but I had pity for mine holy name , which the house of Israel had prof@@ an@@ ed among the he@@ a@@ then , whi@@ ther they went .
therefore say unto the house of Israel , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; I do not this for your s@@ akes , O house of Israel , but for mine holy name 's sake , which ye have prof@@ an@@ ed among the he@@ a@@ then , whi@@ ther ye went .
and I will sancti@@ fy my great name , which was prof@@ an@@ ed among the he@@ a@@ then , which ye have prof@@ an@@ ed in the midst of them ; and the he@@ a@@ then shall know that I am the LORD , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D , when I shall be sancti@@ fied in you before their eyes .
for I will take you from among the he@@ a@@ then , and gather you out of all countries , and will bring you into your own land .
then will I sprink@@ le clean water upon you , and ye shall be clean : from all your fil@@ thiness , and from all your idols , will I clean@@ se you .
I will also save you from all your un@@ cle@@ ann@@ esses : and I will call for the corn , and will increase it , and lay no famine upon you .
and I will multiply the fruit of the tree , and the increase of the field , that ye shall receive no more repro@@ ach of famine among the he@@ a@@ then .
then shall ye remember your own evil ways , and your do@@ ings that were not good , and shall lo@@ the yourselves in your own sight for your ini@@ qu@@ ities and for your ab@@ om@@ inations .
not for your s@@ akes do I this , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D , be it known unto you : be ashamed and conf@@ ounded for your own ways , O house of Israel .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; In the day that I shall have cleans@@ ed you from all your ini@@ qu@@ ities I will also cause you to dwell in the cities , and the wastes shall be buil@@ ded .
and they shall say , This land that was des@@ ol@@ ate is become like the garden of Eden ; and the waste and des@@ ol@@ ate and ruined cities are become f@@ enced , and are inhabited .
then the he@@ a@@ then that are left round about you shall know that I the LORD build the ruined places , and plant that that was des@@ ol@@ ate : I the LORD have spoken it , and I will do it .
as the holy flock , as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn fe@@ asts ; so shall the waste cities be filled with f@@ locks of men : and they shall know that I am the LORD .
and caused me to pass by them round about : and , behold , there were very many in the open valley ; and , lo , they were very dry .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D unto these bones ; Be@@ hold , I will cause breath to enter into you , and ye shall live :
and I will lay sin@@ ews upon you , and will bring up flesh upon you , and cover you with skin , and put breath in you , and ye shall live ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
then he said unto me , Son of man , these bones are the whole house of Israel : behold , they say , Our bones are dried , and our hope is lost : we are cut off for our parts .
therefore proph@@ esy and say unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Be@@ hold , O my people , I will open your graves , and cause you to come up out of your graves , and bring you into the land of Israel .
and ye shall know that I am the LORD , when I have opened your graves , O my people , and brought you up out of your graves ,
and shall put my spirit in you , and ye shall live , and I shall place you in your own land : then shall ye know that I the LORD have spoken it , and performed it , sa@@ ith the LORD .
and say unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Be@@ hold , I will take the children of Israel from among the he@@ a@@ then , whi@@ ther they be gone , and will gather them on every side , and bring them into their own land :
and I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel ; and one king shall be king to them all : and they shall be no more two nations , neither shall they be divided into two king@@ doms any more at all :
and they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my servant , where@@ in your fathers have d@@ wel@@ t ; and they shall dwell therein , even they , and their children , and their children 's children for ever : and my servant David shall be their prince for ever .
moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them ; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them : and I will place them , and multiply them , and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever@@ more .
and the he@@ a@@ then shall know that I the LORD do sancti@@ fy Israel , when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for ever@@ more .
and I will turn thee back , and put hoo@@ ks into thy j@@ aws , and I will bring thee forth , and all th@@ ine army , horses and hor@@ sem@@ en , all of them clo@@ thed with all sorts of arm@@ our , even a great company with buck@@ lers and shi@@ elds , all of them handling s@@ words :
thou shalt asc@@ end and come like a storm , thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land , thou , and all thy bands , and many people with thee .
and thou shalt say , I will go up to the land of un@@ w@@ alled villages ; I will go to them that are at rest , that dwell safely , all of them dwelling without walls , and having neither bars nor gates ,
and thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts , thou , and many people with thee , all of them riding upon horses , a great company , and a mighty army :
and it shall come to pass at the same time when Go@@ g shall come against the land of Israel , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D , that my fury shall come up in my face .
for in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken , Su@@ rely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel ;
and I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D : every man 's sword shall be against his brother .
and I will ple@@ ad against him with pesti@@ l@@ ence and with blood ; and I will rain upon him , and upon his bands , and upon the many people that are with him , an over@@ flowing rain , and great ha@@ il@@ stones , fire , and bri@@ m@@ stone .
thus will I magni@@ fy myself , and sancti@@ fy myself ; and I will be known in the eyes of many nations , and they shall know that I am the LORD .
and I will sm@@ ite thy bow out of thy left hand , and will cause th@@ ine arrows to fall out of thy right hand .
and I will send a fire on Mag@@ og , and among them that dwell ca@@ relessly in the is@@ les : and they shall know that I am the LORD .
so will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel ; and I will not let them poll@@ ute my holy name any more : and the he@@ a@@ then shall know that I am the LORD , the Holy One in Israel .
ye@@ a , all the people of the land shall bury them ; and it shall be to them a renow@@ n the day that I shall be glori@@ fied , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
and ye shall eat fat till ye be full , and drink blood till ye be drun@@ ken , of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you .
thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and ch@@ ari@@ ots , with mighty men , and with all men of war , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
when I have brought them again from the people , and gathered them out of their enemies ' lands , and am sancti@@ fied in them in the sight of many nations ;
then shall they know that I am the LORD their God , which cause them to be led into cap@@ tivity among the he@@ a@@ then : but I have gathered them unto their own land , and have left none of them any more there .
in the five and twentieth year of our cap@@ tivity , in the beginning of the year , in the tenth day of the month , in the four@@ teenth year after that the city was sm@@ it@@ ten , in the self@@ same day the hand of the LORD was upon me , and brought me thi@@ ther .
in the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel , and set me upon a very high mountain , by which was as the frame of a city on the south .
and he brought me thi@@ ther , and , behold , there was a man , whose appearance was like the appearance of brass , with a line of fla@@ x in his hand , and a measuring re@@ ed ; and he stood in the gate .
then came he unto the gate which loo@@ ket@@ h toward the east , and went up the stairs thereof , and measured the threshold of the gate , which was one re@@ ed broad ; and the other threshold of the gate , which was one re@@ ed broad .
and every little chamber was one re@@ ed long , and one re@@ ed broad ; and between the little chambers were five cub@@ its ; and the threshold of the gate by the por@@ ch of the gate within was one re@@ ed .
then measured he the por@@ ch of the gate , eight cub@@ its ; and the posts thereof , two cub@@ its ; and the por@@ ch of the gate was inward .
and the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side , and three on that side ; they three were of one measure : and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side .
the space also before the little chambers was one cub@@ it on this side , and the space was one cub@@ it on that side : and the little chambers were six cub@@ its on this side , and six cub@@ its on that side .
he measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another : the breadth was five and twenty cub@@ its , door against door .
and there were narrow windows to the little chambers , and to their posts within the gate round about , and likewise to the arch@@ es : and windows were round about inward : and upon each post were palm trees .
then brought he me into the outward court , and , lo , there were chambers , and a pav@@ ement made for the court round about : thirty chambers were upon the pav@@ ement .
then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without , an hundred cub@@ its eastward and nor@@ th@@ ward .
and their windows , and their arch@@ es , and their palm trees , were after the measure of the gate that loo@@ ket@@ h toward the east ; and they went up unto it by seven steps ; and the arch@@ es thereof were before them .
and the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward the north , and toward the east ; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cub@@ its .
after that he brought me toward the south , and behold a gate toward the south : and he measured the posts thereof and the arch@@ es thereof according to these measures .
and there were windows in it and in the arch@@ es thereof round about , like those windows : the length was fifty cub@@ its , and the breadth five and twenty cub@@ its .
and there were seven steps to go up to it , and the arch@@ es thereof were before them : and it had palm trees , one on this side , and another on that side , upon the posts thereof .
and there was a gate in the inner court toward the south : and he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cub@@ its .
and the little chambers thereof , and the posts thereof , and the arch@@ es thereof , according to these measures : and there were windows in it and in the arch@@ es thereof round about : it was fifty cub@@ its long , and five and twenty cub@@ its broad .
and the arch@@ es thereof were toward the outward court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and the posts thereof were toward the utter court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
and without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court , which was at the side of the north gate ; and their prospect was toward the south : one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north .
and he said unto me , This chamber , whose prospect is toward the south , is for the priests , the keepers of the charge of the house .
and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests , the keepers of the charge of the altar : these are the sons of Z@@ ad@@ ok among the sons of Lev@@ i , which come near to the LORD to minister unto him .
the length of the por@@ ch was twenty cub@@ its , and the breadth eleven cub@@ its ; and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it : and there were pillars by the posts , one on this side , and another on that side .
afterward he brought me to the temple , and measured the posts , six cub@@ its broad on the one side , and six cub@@ its broad on the other side , which was the breadth of the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
and the breadth of the door was ten cub@@ its ; and the sides of the door were five cub@@ its on the one side , and five cub@@ its on the other side : and he measured the length thereof , forty cub@@ its : and the breadth , twenty cub@@ its .
then went he inward , and measured the post of the door , two cub@@ its ; and the door , six cub@@ its ; and the breadth of the door , seven cub@@ its .
so he measured the length thereof , twenty cub@@ its ; and the breadth , twenty cub@@ its , before the temple : and he said unto me , This is the most holy place .
after he measured the wall of the house , six cub@@ its ; and the breadth of every side chamber , four cub@@ its , round about the house on every side .
now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cub@@ its broad ; and the wall of the building was five cub@@ its thick round about , and the length thereof ninety cub@@ its .
and the doors had two leaves api@@ ece , two turning leaves ; two leaves for the one door , and two leaves for the other door .
and there were made on them , on the doors of the temple , cher@@ ub@@ ims and palm trees , like as were made upon the walls ; and there were thick plan@@ ks upon the face of the por@@ ch without .
and there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side , on the sides of the por@@ ch , and upon the side chambers of the house , and thick plan@@ ks .
now the upper chambers were shorter : for the galleries were higher than these , than the lower , and than the midd@@ lem@@ ost of the building .
and the wall that was without over against the chambers , toward the utter court on the fore@@ part of the chambers , the length thereof was fifty cub@@ its .
for the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cub@@ its : and , lo , before the temple were an hundred cub@@ its .
and from under these chambers was the entry on the east side , as one go@@ eth into them from the utter court .
and according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way , even the way directly before the wall toward the east , as one enter@@ eth into them .
now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house , he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east , and measured it round about .
he measured the east side with the measuring re@@ ed , five hundred re@@ eds , with the measuring re@@ ed round about .
he measured it by the four sides : it had a wall round about , five hundred re@@ eds long , and five hundred broad , to make a separation between the sanctuary and the prof@@ ane place .
and , behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like a noise of many waters : and the earth sh@@ ined with his glory .
so the spirit took me up , and brought me into the inner court ; and , behold , the glory of the LORD filled the house .
now let them put away their wh@@ ore@@ dom , and the car@@ cases of their kings , far from me , and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever .
and from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cub@@ its , and the breadth one cub@@ it ; and from the lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cub@@ its , and the breadth one cub@@ it .
and he said unto me , Son of man , thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; These are the ordin@@ ances of the altar in the day when they shall make it , to offer burnt offerings there@@ on , and to sprink@@ le blood there@@ on .
and thou shalt take of the blood thereof , and put it on the four horns of it , and on the four corners of the settle , and upon the border round about : thus shalt thou clean@@ se and purge it .
thou shalt take the bul@@ lock also of the sin offering , and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house , without the sanctuary .
and on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without bl@@ emish for a sin offering ; and they shall clean@@ se the altar , as they did clean@@ se it with the bul@@ lock .
when thou hast made an end of cleansing it , thou shalt offer a young bul@@ lock without bl@@ emish , and a ram out of the flock without bl@@ emish .
and when these days are expired , it shall be , that upon the eighth day , and so forward , the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar , and your peace offerings ; and I will accept you , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
then said the LORD unto me ; This gate shall be shut , it shall not be opened , and no man shall enter in by it ; because the LORD , the God of Israel , hath entered in by it , therefore it shall be shut .
it is for the prince ; the prince , he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD ; he shall enter by the way of the por@@ ch of that gate , and shall go out by the way of the same .
then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house : and I looked , and , behold , the glory of the LORD filled the house of the LORD : and I fell upon my face .
and ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things : but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves .
yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary , having charge at the gates of the house , and minist@@ ering to the house : they shall sl@@ ay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people , and they shall stand before them to minister unto them .
they shall enter into my sanctuary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister unto me , and they shall keep my charge .
neither shall they take for their wives a widow , nor her that is put away : but they shall take mai@@ dens of the seed of the house of Israel , or a widow that had a priest before .
and they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and prof@@ ane , and cause them to discern between the un@@ clean and the clean .
and in controversy they shall stand in judgment ; and they shall judge it according to my judgments : and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies ; and they shall hal@@ low my sab@@ baths .
and it shall be unto them for an inheritance : I am their inheritance : and ye shall give them no possession in Israel : I am their possession .
and of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand , and the breadth of ten thousand : and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place .
and ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad , and five and twenty thousand long , over against the ob@@ lation of the holy portion : it shall be for the whole house of Israel .
in the land shall be his possession in Israel : and my princes shall no more op@@ press my people ; and the rest of the land shall they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Let it suffice you , O princes of Israel : remove violence and spoil , and execute judgment and justice , take away your ex@@ actions from my people , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
the ep@@ ha@@ h and the bath shall be of one measure , that the bath may contain the tenth part of an Hom@@ er , and the ep@@ ha@@ h the tenth part of an Hom@@ er : the measure thereof shall be after the Hom@@ er .
and one lamb out of the flock , out of two hundred , out of the fat past@@ ures of Israel ; for a meat offering , and for a burnt offering , and for peace offerings , to make reconciliation for them , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; In the first month , in the first day of the month , thou shalt take a young bul@@ lock without bl@@ emish , and clean@@ se the sanctuary :
in the first month , in the four@@ teenth day of the month , ye shall have the pas@@ sover , a feast of seven days ; un@@ leav@@ ened bread shall be eaten .
and upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bul@@ lock for a sin offering .
and he shall prepare a meat offering of an ep@@ ha@@ h for a bul@@ lock , and an ep@@ ha@@ h for a ram , and an H@@ in of oil for an ep@@ ha@@ h .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; The gate of the inner court that loo@@ ket@@ h toward the east shall be shut the six working days ; but on the sab@@ bath it shall be opened , and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened .
likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sab@@ baths and in the new mo@@ ons .
and the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD in the sab@@ bath day shall be six lam@@ bs without bl@@ emish , and a ram without bl@@ emish .
and in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bul@@ lock without bl@@ emish , and six lam@@ bs , and a ram : they shall be without bl@@ emish .
and in the feast and in the solem@@ n@@ ities the meat offering shall be an ep@@ ha@@ h to a bul@@ lock , and ep@@ ha@@ h to a ram , and to the lam@@ bs as he is able to give , and an H@@ in of oil to an ep@@ ha@@ h .
after he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the holy chambers of the priests , which looked toward the north : and , behold , there was a place on the two sides w@@ est@@ ward .
then said he unto me , This is the place where the priests shall boil the t@@ resp@@ ass offering and the sin offering , where they shall b@@ ake the meat offering ; that they bear them not out into the utter court , to sancti@@ fy the people .
and when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward , he measured a thousand cub@@ its , and he brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the an@@ cles .
again he measured a thousand , and brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the knees . again he measured a thousand , and brought me through ; the waters were to the lo@@ ins .
thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; This shall be the border , whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of Israel : Joseph shall have two portions .
and this shall be the border of the land toward the north side , from the great sea , the way of H@@ eth@@ lon , as men go to Zed@@ ad ;
Ham@@ ath , Ber@@ oth@@ ah , Si@@ bra@@ im , which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Ham@@ ath ; Haz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ hat@@ tic@@ on , which is by the coast of H@@ aur@@ an .
and the border from the sea shall be Haz@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ en@@ an , the border of Damascus , and the north nor@@ th@@ ward , and the border of Ham@@ ath . and this is the north side .
and the east side ye shall measure from H@@ aur@@ an , and from Damascus , and from Gil@@ e@@ ad , and from the land of Israel by Jordan , from the border unto the east sea . and this is the east side .
the west side also shall be the great sea from the border , till a man come over against Ham@@ ath . this is the west side .
and by the border of Dan , from the east side unto the west side , a portion for Ash@@ er .
and by the border of Ash@@ er , from the east side even unto the west side , a portion for N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i .
and by the border of N@@ aph@@ tal@@ i , from the east side unto the west side , a portion for Man@@ as@@ se@@ h .
and by the border of Man@@ as@@ se@@ h , from the east side unto the west side , a portion for E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im .
and by the border of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , from the east side even unto the west side , a portion for Re@@ ub@@ en .
and by the border of Re@@ ub@@ en , from the east side unto the west side , a portion for Jud@@ ah .
it shall be for the priests that are sancti@@ fied of the sons of Z@@ ad@@ ok ; which have kept my charge , which went not astr@@ ay when the children of Israel went astr@@ ay , as the Lev@@ ites went astr@@ ay .
and this ob@@ lation of the land that is offered shall be unto them a thing most holy by the border of the Lev@@ ites .
and over against the border of the priests the Lev@@ ites shall have five and twenty thousand in length , and ten thousand in breadth : all the length shall be five and twenty thousand , and the breadth ten thousand .
and the five thousand , that are left in the breadth over against the five and twenty thousand , shall be a prof@@ ane place for the city , for dwelling , and for suburbs : and the city shall be in the midst thereof .
moreover from the possession of the Lev@@ ites , and from the possession of the city , being in the midst of that which is the prince 's , between the border of Jud@@ ah and the border of Benjamin , shall be for the prince .
this is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance , and these are their portions , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D .
and the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes of Israel : three gates nor@@ th@@ ward ; one gate of Re@@ ub@@ en , one gate of Jud@@ ah , one gate of Lev@@ i .
and at the east side four thousand and five hundred : and three gates ; and one gate of Joseph , one gate of Benjamin , one gate of Dan .
and at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures : and three gates ; one gate of Sim@@ eon , one gate of Is@@ sac@@ har , one gate of Ze@@ bu@@ lu@@ n .
it was round about eighteen thousand measures : and the name of the city from that day shall be , The LORD is there .
and the king appointed them a daily provision of the king 's meat , and of the wine which he drank : so nour@@ ishing them three years , that at the end thereof they might stand before the king .
but Daniel pur@@ posed in his heart that he would not def@@ ile himself with the portion of the king 's meat , nor with the wine which he drank : therefore he requested of the prince of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s that he might not def@@ ile himself .
then said Daniel to Mel@@ z@@ ar , whom the prince of the e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s had set over Daniel , Han@@ ani@@ ah , Mis@@ hael , and Az@@ ari@@ ah ,
then let our coun@@ ten@@ ances be looked upon before thee , and the coun@@ tenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king 's meat : and as thou se@@ est , deal with thy servants .
and at the end of ten days their coun@@ ten@@ ances appeared fairer and fat@@ ter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king 's meat .
and in the second year of the reign of Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar dreamed dreams , where@@ with his spirit was troubled , and his sleep brake from him .
then the king commanded to call the mag@@ icians , and the astro@@ log@@ ers , and the sorcer@@ ers , and the Chal@@ de@@ ans , for to sh@@ ew the king his dreams . so they came and stood before the king .
then sp@@ ake the Chal@@ de@@ ans to the king in Syri@@ ack , O king , live for ever : tell thy servants the dream , and we will sh@@ ew the interpretation .
the king answered and said to the Chal@@ de@@ ans , The thing is gone from me : if ye will not make known unto me the dream , with the interpretation thereof , ye shall be cut in pieces , and your houses shall be made a dun@@ gh@@ ill .
but if ye sh@@ ew the dream , and the interpretation thereof , ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour : therefore sh@@ ew me the dream , and the interpretation thereof .
and it is a rare thing that the king requi@@ re@@ th , and there is none other that can sh@@ ew it before the king , except the gods , whose dwelling is not with flesh .
for this cause the king was angry and very furious , and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon .
then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Ari@@ o@@ ch the captain of the king 's guard , which was gone forth to sl@@ ay the wise men of Babylon :
he answered and said to Ari@@ o@@ ch the king 's captain , Why is the decree so ha@@ sty from the king ? then Ari@@ o@@ ch made the thing known to Daniel .
then Daniel went in , and desired of the king that he would give him time , and that he would sh@@ ew the king the interpretation .
that they would desire mer@@ cies of the God of heaven concerning this secret ; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon .
I thank thee , and praise thee , O thou God of my fathers , who hast given me wisdom and might , and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee : for thou hast now made known unto us the king 's matter .
the king answered and said to Daniel , whose name was Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen , and the interpretation thereof ?
Daniel answered in the presence of the king , and said , The secret which the king hath demanded C@@ AN@@ NOT the wise men , the astro@@ log@@ ers , the mag@@ icians , the soo@@ th@@ say@@ ers , sh@@ ew unto the king ;
but there is a God in heaven that reve@@ al@@ eth secrets , and mak@@ eth known to the king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar what shall be in the latter days . thy dream , and the visions of thy head upon thy bed , are these ;
as for thee , O king , thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed , what should come to pass here@@ after : and he that reve@@ al@@ eth secrets mak@@ eth known to thee what shall come to pass .
and wher@@ eso@@ ever the children of men dwell , the beasts of the field and the f@@ ow@@ ls of the heaven hath he given into th@@ ine hand , and hath made thee ruler over them all . thou art this head of gold .
and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron : for@@ as@@ much as iron break@@ eth in pieces and subdu@@ eth all things : and as iron that break@@ eth all these , shall it break in pieces and bru@@ ise .
then the king Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar fell upon his face , and wor@@ shipped Daniel , and commanded that they should offer an ob@@ lation and sweet od@@ ours unto him .
then Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king sent to gather together the princes , the governors , and the cap@@ tains , the judges , the treas@@ ur@@ ers , the counsel@@ lers , the sh@@ eri@@ ffs , and all the rulers of the provinces , to come to the dedication of the image which Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king had set up .
that at what time ye hear the sound of the Cor@@ net , fl@@ ute , har@@ p , s@@ ack@@ but , p@@ sal@@ tery , dul@@ ci@@ mer , and all kinds of mus@@ ick , ye fall down and worship the golden image that Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king hath set up :
thou , O king , hast made a decree , that every man that shall hear the sound of the Cor@@ net , fl@@ ute , har@@ p , s@@ ack@@ but , p@@ sal@@ tery , and dul@@ ci@@ mer , and all kinds of mus@@ ick , shall fall down and worship the golden image :
then Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , M@@ esh@@ ach , and A@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ go . then they brought these men before the king .
Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar sp@@ ake and said unto them , Is it true , O Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , M@@ esh@@ ach , and A@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ go , do not ye serve my gods , nor worship the golden image which I have set up ?
Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , M@@ esh@@ ach , and A@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ go , answered and said to the king , O Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar , we are not careful to answer thee in this matter .
if it be so , our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace , and he will deliver us out of th@@ ine hand , O king .
and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , M@@ esh@@ ach , and A@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ go , and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace .
therefore because the king 's commandment was urgent , and the furnace exceeding hot , the flame of the fire sle@@ w those men that took up Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , M@@ esh@@ ach , and A@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ go .
and these three men , Sh@@ ad@@ r@@ ach , M@@ esh@@ ach , and A@@ bed @@@ -@@ @ ne@@ go , fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace .
then Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar the king was aston@@ ied , and rose up in ha@@ ste , and sp@@ ake , and said unto his counsel@@ lers , Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire ? they answered and said unto the king , True , O king .
he answered and said , L@@ o , I see four men loose , walking in the midst of the fire , and they have no hurt ; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God .
therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me , that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream .
then came in the mag@@ icians , the astro@@ log@@ ers , the Chal@@ de@@ ans , and the soo@@ th@@ say@@ ers : and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof .
but at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar , according to the name of my god , and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods : and before him I told the dream , saying ,
thus were the visions of mine head in my bed ; I saw , and behold a tree in the midst of the earth , and the height thereof was great .
whose leaves were fair , and the fruit thereof much , and in it was meat for all ; under which the beasts of the field d@@ wel@@ t , and upon whose branches the f@@ ow@@ ls of the heaven had their hab@@ itation :
W@@ herefore , O king , let my counsel be acceptable unto thee , and break off thy sins by righteousness , and th@@ ine ini@@ qu@@ ities by sh@@ ew@@ ing mercy to the poor ; if it may be a leng@@ th@@ ening of thy tranqu@@ ill@@ ity .
the king sp@@ ake , and said , Is not this great Babylon , that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power , and for the honour of my maj@@ esty ?
Bel@@ sha@@ zz@@ ar , wh@@ iles he t@@ asted the wine , commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem ; that the king , and his princes , his wives , and his conc@@ ub@@ ines , might drink therein .
then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem ; and the king , and his princes , his wives , and his conc@@ ub@@ ines , drank in them .
then the king 's coun@@ tenance was changed , and his thoughts troubled him , so that the joints of his lo@@ ins were loos@@ ed , and his knees smo@@ te one against another .
then was Daniel brought in before the king . and the king sp@@ ake and said unto Daniel , Art thou that Daniel , which art of the children of the cap@@ tivity of Jud@@ ah , whom the king my father brought out of Jew@@ ry ?
I have even heard of thee , that the spirit of the gods is in thee , and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee .
then Daniel answered and said before the king , Let thy gifts be to thy@@ self , and give thy rewards to another ; yet I will read the writing unto the king , and make known to him the interpretation .
O thou king , the most high God gave Ne@@ bu@@ ch@@ ad@@ ne@@ zz@@ ar thy father a kingdom , and maj@@ esty , and glory , and honour :
but when his heart was lifted up , and his mind hardened in pride , he was de@@ posed from his kingly throne , and they took his glory from him :
then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes , because an excellent spirit was in him ; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm .
now , O king , establish the decree , and sign the writing , that it be not changed , according to the law of the Med@@ es and Per@@ sians , which alter@@ eth not .
then these men assembled unto the king , and said unto the king , Know , O king , that the law of the Med@@ es and Per@@ sians is , That no decree nor statute which the king establish@@ eth may be changed .
then the king commanded , and they brought Daniel , and cast him into the den of lions . now the king sp@@ ake and said unto Daniel , Th@@ y God whom thou serv@@ est continually , he will deliver thee .
and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den ; and the king sealed it with his own sig@@ net , and with the sig@@ net of his lords ; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel .
and when he came to the den , he cried with a lam@@ ent@@ able voice unto Daniel : and the king sp@@ ake and said to Daniel , O Daniel , servant of the living God , is thy God , whom thou serv@@ est continually , able to deliver thee from the lions ?
my God hath sent his angel , and hath shut the lions ' mouths , that they have not hurt me : for@@ as@@ much as before him inno@@ c@@ ency was found in me ; and also before thee , O king , have I done no hurt .
then was the king exceeding glad for him , and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den . so Daniel was taken up out of the den , and no manner of hurt was found upon him , because he believed in his God .
in the first year of Bel@@ sha@@ zz@@ ar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed : then he wrote the dream , and told the sum of the matters .
the first was like a lion , and had eagle 's wings : I be@@ held till the wings thereof were pl@@ ucked , and it was lifted up from the earth , and made stand upon the feet as a man , and a man 's heart was given to it .
and behold another beast , a second , like to a bear , and it raised up itself on one side , and it had three ri@@ bs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it : and they said thus unto it , A@@ rise , dev@@ our much flesh .
a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him : thousand thousands minist@@ ered unto him , and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him : the judgment was set , and the books were opened .
I be@@ held then because of the voice of the great words which the horn sp@@ ake : I be@@ held even till the beast was sl@@ ain , and his body destroyed , and given to the burning flame .
as concerning the rest of the beasts , they had their dom@@ inion taken away : yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time .
and there was given him dom@@ inion , and glory , and a kingdom , that all people , nations , and languages , should serve him : his dom@@ inion is an everlasting dom@@ inion , which shall not pass away , and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed .
I came near unto one of them that stood by , and asked him the truth of all this . so he told me , and made me know the interpretation of the things .
then I would know the truth of the fourth beast , which was diverse from all the others , exceeding dreadful , whose teeth were of iron , and his nails of brass ; which dev@@ oured , brake in pieces , and stamped the resi@@ due with his feet ;
until the Ancient of days came , and judgment was given to the saints of the most High ; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom .
thus he said , The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth , which shall be diverse from all king@@ doms , and shall dev@@ our the whole earth , and shall t@@ read it down , and break it in pieces .
and the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise : and another shall rise after them ; and he shall be diverse from the first , and he shall sub@@ due three kings .
and he shall speak great words against the most High , and shall wear out the saints of the most High , and think to change times and laws : and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time .
hitherto is the end of the matter . as for me Daniel , my cog@@ itations much troubled me , and my coun@@ tenance changed in me : but I kept the matter in my heart .
and I saw in a vision ; and it came to pass , when I saw , that I was at Sh@@ ush@@ an in the palace , which is in the province of EL@@ AM ; and I saw in a vision , and I was by the river of U@@ la@@ i .
then I lifted up mine eyes , and saw , and , behold , there stood before the river a ram which had two horns : and the two horns were high ; but one was higher than the other , and the higher came up last .
and he came to the ram that had two horns , which I had there seen standing before the river , and ran unto him in the fury of his power .
therefore the he goat wa@@ xed very great : and when he was strong , the great horn was broken ; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven .
ye@@ a , he magni@@ fied himself even to the prince of the host , and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away , and the place of his sanctuary was cast down .
and an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of trans@@ g@@ ression , and it cast down the truth to the ground ; and it practi@@ sed , and prosper@@ ed .
and I heard a man 's voice between the banks of U@@ la@@ i , which called , and said , Gabriel , make this man to understand the vision .
and he said , Be@@ hold , I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation : for at the time appointed the end shall be .
and his power shall be mighty , but not by his own power : and he shall destroy wonder@@ fully , and shall prosper , and practi@@ se , and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people .
and through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand ; and he shall magni@@ fy himself in his heart , and by peace shall destroy many : he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes ; but he shall be broken without hand .
and I Daniel fain@@ ted , and was sick certain days ; afterward I rose up , and did the king 's business ; and I was astonished at the vision , but none understood it .
in the first year of D@@ arius the son of Ah@@ as@@ u@@ er@@ us , of the seed of the Med@@ es , which was made king over the realm of the Chal@@ de@@ ans ;
in the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years , where@@ of the word of the LORD came to Jer@@ emi@@ ah the prophet , that he would accomplish seventy years in the des@@ ol@@ ations of Jerusalem .
and I set my face unto the Lord God , to seek by prayer and suppl@@ ication , with fasting , and s@@ ack@@ cloth , and ashes :
neither have we hear@@ k@@ ened unto thy servants the prophets , which sp@@ ake in thy name to our kings , our princes , and our fathers , and to all the people of the land .
ye@@ a , all Israel have trans@@ g@@ ressed thy law , even by departing , that they might not obey thy voice ; therefore the curse is poured upon us , and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God , because we have sin@@ ned against him .
and he hath confirmed his words , which he sp@@ ake against us , and against our judges that judged us , by bringing upon us a great evil : for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem .
therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil , and brought it upon us : for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he do@@ eth : for we obeyed not his voice .
and now , O Lord our God , that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and hast gotten thee renow@@ n , as at this day ; we have sin@@ ned , we have done w@@ ick@@ edly .
now therefore , O our God , hear the prayer of thy servant , and his suppl@@ ications , and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is des@@ ol@@ ate , for the Lord 's sake .
O Lord , hear ; O Lord , forgive ; O Lord , hear@@ ken and do ; def@@ er not , for th@@ ine own sake , O my God : for thy city and thy people are called by thy name .
and wh@@ iles I was speaking , and praying , and conf@@ essing my sin and the sin of my people Israel , and presenting my suppl@@ ication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God ;
and he informed me , and talked with me , and said , O Daniel , I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding .
at the beginning of thy suppl@@ ications the commandment came forth , and I am come to sh@@ ew thee ; for thou art greatly beloved : therefore understand the matter , and consider the vision .
in the third year of Cy@@ rus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel , whose name was called Bel@@ tes@@ haz@@ z@@ ar ; and the thing was true , but the time appointed was long : and he understood the thing , and had understanding of the vision .
yet heard I the voice of his words : and when I heard the voice of his words , then was I in a deep sleep on my face , and my face toward the ground .
but the prince of the kingdom of Persia with@@ stood me one and twenty days : but , lo , Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me ; and I remained there with the kings of Persia .
and when he had spoken such words unto me , I set my face toward the ground , and I became dumb .
for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ? for as for me , strai@@ gh@@ tw@@ ay there remained no strength in me , neither is there breath left in me .
and shall also carry cap@@ tives into Egypt their gods , with their princes , and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold ; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north .
but his sons shall be stirred up , and shall assemble a multitude of great forces : and one shall certainly come , and over@@ flow , and pass through : then shall he return , and be stirred up , even to his fortress .
and in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south : also the rob@@ bers of thy people shall ex@@ alt themselves to establish the vision ; but they shall fall .
and both these kings ' hearts shall be to do mis@@ chief , and they shall speak lies at one table ; but it shall not prosper : for yet the end shall be at the time appointed .
then shall he return into his land with great riches ; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant ; and he shall do exploits , and return to his own land .
at the time appointed he shall return , and come toward the south ; but it shall not be as the former , or as the latter .
and such as do w@@ ick@@ edly against the covenant shall he corrupt by fl@@ atter@@ ies : but the people that do know their God shall be strong , and do exploits .
now when they shall fall , they shall be hol@@ pen with a little help : but many shall cle@@ ave to them with fl@@ atter@@ ies .
he shall enter also into the glorious land , and many countries shall be overthrown : but these shall escape out of his hand , even E@@ dom , and Mo@@ ab , and the chief of the children of Am@@ mon .
he shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries : and the land of Egypt shall not escape .
but ti@@ dings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him : therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy , and utterly to make away many .
and he shall plant the tab@@ ern@@ acles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain ; yet he shall come to his end , and none shall help him .
and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake , some to everlasting life , and some to shame and everlasting contempt .
and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firm@@ ament ; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever .
but thou , O Daniel , shut up the words , and seal the book , even to the time of the end : many shall run to and fro , and knowledge shall be increased .
then I Daniel looked , and , behold , there stood other two , the one on this side of the bank of the river , and the other on that side of the bank of the river .
and one said to the man clo@@ thed in linen , which was upon the waters of the river , How long shall it be to the end of these wonders ?
and he said , Go thy way , Daniel : for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end .
but go thou thy way till the end be : for thou shalt rest , and stand in thy lot at the end of the days .
the word of the LORD that came unto Hos@@ ea , the son of Be@@ eri , in the days of Uz@@ zi@@ ah , Jo@@ th@@ am , A@@ haz , and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , kings of Jud@@ ah , and in the days of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Jo@@ ash , king of Israel .
the beginning of the word of the LORD by Hos@@ ea . and the LORD said to Hos@@ ea , Go , take unto thee a wife of wh@@ ore@@ doms and children of wh@@ ore@@ doms : for the land hath committed great wh@@ ore@@ dom , departing from the LORD .
and the LORD said unto him , Call his name J@@ ez@@ re@@ el ; for yet a little while , and I will av@@ enge the blood of J@@ ez@@ re@@ el upon the house of Je@@ hu , and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel .
and she conceived again , and bare a daughter . and God said unto him , Call her name L@@ o @@@ -@@ @ ru@@ ham@@ ah : for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel ; but I will utterly take them away .
ple@@ ad with your mother , ple@@ ad : for she is not my wife , neither am I her husband : let her therefore put away her wh@@ ore@@ doms out of her sight , and her adul@@ ter@@ ies from between her breasts ;
and I will not have mercy upon her children ; for they be the children of wh@@ ore@@ doms .
for their mother hath played the har@@ lot : she that conceived them hath done sham@@ efully : for she said , I will go after my lovers , that give me my bread and my water , my wool and my fla@@ x , mine oil and my drink .
and she shall follow after her lovers , but she shall not over@@ take them ; and she shall seek them , but shall not find them : then shall she say , I will go and return to my first husband ; for then was it better with me than now .
therefore will I return , and take away my corn in the time thereof , and my wine in the season thereof , and will recover my wool and my fla@@ x given to cover her n@@ ak@@ edness .
I will also cause all her mir@@ th to cease , her feast days , her new mo@@ ons , and her sab@@ baths , and all her solemn fe@@ asts .
and I will visit upon her the days of Ba@@ ali@@ m , where@@ in she burned inc@@ ense to them , and she dec@@ ked herself with her ear@@ rings and her jew@@ els , and she went after her lovers , and for@@ g@@ at me , sa@@ ith the LORD .
and I will give her her vineyards from th@@ ence , and the valley of Ach@@ or for a door of hope : and she shall sing there , as in the days of her youth , and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt .
and I will sow her unto me in the earth ; and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy ; and I will say to them which were not my people , Th@@ ou art my people ; and they shall say , Th@@ ou art my God .
and I said unto her , Th@@ ou shalt abide for me many days ; thou shalt not play the har@@ lot , and thou shalt not be for another man : so will I also be for thee .
afterward shall the children of Israel return , and seek the LORD their God , and David their king ; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days .
hear the word of the LORD , ye children of Israel : for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land , because there is no truth , nor mercy , nor knowledge of God in the land .
by sw@@ earing , and lying , and killing , and stealing , and committing adul@@ tery , they break out , and blood touch@@ eth blood .
my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge : because thou hast rejected knowledge , I will also reject thee , that thou shalt be no priest to me : seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God , I will also forget thy children .
my people ask counsel at their stocks , and their staff decla@@ re@@ th unto them : for the spirit of wh@@ ore@@ doms hath caused them to er@@ r , and they have gone a wh@@ oring from under their God .
they sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains , and burn inc@@ ense upon the hills , under o@@ aks and po@@ pl@@ ars and el@@ ms , because the shadow thereof is good : therefore your daughters shall commit wh@@ ore@@ dom , and your spouses shall commit adul@@ tery .
hear ye this , O priests ; and hear@@ ken , ye house of Israel ; and give ye ear , O house of the king ; for judgment is toward you , because ye have been a sn@@ are on M@@ iz@@ pa@@ h , and a net spread upon Tab@@ or .
I know E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and Israel is not hid from me : for now , O E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , thou commit@@ test wh@@ ore@@ dom , and Israel is de@@ filed .
they have dealt treach@@ er@@ ously against the LORD : for they have be@@ gotten strange children : now shall a month dev@@ our them with their portions .
the princes of Jud@@ ah were like them that remove the bound : therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water .
therefore will I be unto E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im as a moth , and to the house of Jud@@ ah as rot@@ ten@@ ness .
after two days will he revive us : in the third day he will raise us up , and we shall live in his sight .
then shall we know , if we follow on to know the LORD : his going forth is prepared as the morning ; and he shall come unto us as the rain , as the latter and former rain unto the earth .
they are all adul@@ ter@@ ers , as an oven heated by the b@@ aker , who ceas@@ eth from raising after he hath k@@ needed the d@@ ough , until it be leav@@ ened .
for they have made ready their heart like an oven , wh@@ iles they lie in wait : their b@@ aker sleep@@ eth all the night ; in the morning it bur@@ neth as a fl@@ aming fire .
when they shall go , I will spread my net upon them ; I will bring them down as the f@@ ow@@ ls of the heaven ; I will ch@@ as@@ tise them , as their congregation hath heard .
w@@ oe unto them ! for they have fled from me : destruction unto them ! because they have trans@@ g@@ ressed against me : though I have re@@ deemed them , yet they have spoken lies against me .
they return , but not to the most High : they are like a dece@@ it@@ ful bow : their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue : this shall be their deri@@ sion in the land of Egypt .
set the trum@@ pet to thy mouth . he shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD , because they have trans@@ g@@ ressed my covenant , and t@@ resp@@ assed against my law .
they have set up kings , but not by me : they have made princes , and I knew it not : of their silver and their gold have they made them idols , that they may be cut off .
for from Israel was it also : the work@@ man made it ; therefore it is not God : but the cal@@ f of Sam@@ aria shall be broken in pieces .
ye@@ a , though they have hired among the nations , now will I gather them , and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes .
I have written to him the great things of my law , but they were counted as a strange thing .
they sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings , and eat it ; but the LORD accept@@ eth them not ; now will he remember their ini@@ qu@@ ity , and visit their sins : they shall return to Egypt .
for Israel hath forgotten his Maker , and buil@@ det@@ h temples ; and Jud@@ ah hath multiplied f@@ enced cities : but I will send a fire upon his cities , and it shall dev@@ our the palaces thereof .
they shall not dwell in the LORD 's land ; but E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall return to Egypt , and they shall eat un@@ clean things in As@@ sy@@ ria .
for , lo , they are gone because of destruction : Egypt shall gather them up , M@@ emp@@ his shall bury them : the pleasant places for their silver , net@@ tles shall possess them : thor@@ ns shall be in their tab@@ ern@@ acles .
the days of vis@@ itation are come , the days of re@@ comp@@ ence are come ; Israel shall know it : the prophet is a fool , the spiritual man is mad , for the multitude of th@@ ine ini@@ qu@@ ity , and the great hatred .
the watch@@ man of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im was with my God : but the prophet is a sn@@ are of a F@@ ow@@ ler in all his ways , and hatred in the house of his God .
all their w@@ ick@@ edness is in Gil@@ gal : for there I hated them : for the w@@ ick@@ edness of their do@@ ings I will drive them out of mine house , I will love them no more : all their princes are revol@@ ters .
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is sm@@ it@@ ten , their root is dried up , they shall bear no fruit : ye@@ a , though they bring forth , yet will I sl@@ ay even the beloved fruit of their womb .
my God will cast them away , because they did not hear@@ ken unto him : and they shall be wan@@ der@@ ers among the nations .
the high places also of A@@ ven , the sin of Israel , shall be destroyed : the thor@@ n and the th@@ ist@@ le shall come up on their al@@ t@@ ars ; and they shall say to the mountains , C@@ over us ; and to the hills , Fall on us .
it is in my desire that I should ch@@ as@@ tise them ; and the people shall be gathered against them , when they shall bind themselves in their two fur@@ rows .
and E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im is as an hei@@ fer that is taught , and lov@@ eth to t@@ read out the corn ; but I passed over upon her fair neck : I will make E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im to ride ; Jud@@ ah shall plo@@ w , and Jacob shall break his clo@@ ds .
ye have pl@@ owed w@@ ick@@ edness , ye have re@@ aped ini@@ qu@@ ity ; ye have eaten the fruit of lies : because thou did@@ st trust in thy way , in the multitude of thy mighty men .
therefore shall a tum@@ ult arise among thy people , and all thy fort@@ resses shall be spoiled , as Shal@@ man spoiled B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ Ar@@ bel in the day of battle : the mother was d@@ ashed in pieces upon her children .
I drew them with cor@@ ds of a man , with bands of love : and I was to them as they that take off the y@@ oke on their j@@ aws , and I laid meat unto them .
and the sword shall abide on his cities , and shall consume his branches , and dev@@ our them , because of their own coun@@ sels .
and my people are bent to back@@ sliding from me : though they called them to the most High , none at all would ex@@ alt him .
they shall trem@@ ble as a bird out of Egypt , and as a do@@ ve out of the land of As@@ sy@@ ria : and I will place them in their houses , sa@@ ith the LORD .
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im feed@@ eth on wind , and follow@@ eth after the east wind : he daily increas@@ eth lies and des@@ ol@@ ation ; and they do make a covenant with the As@@ sy@@ rians , and oil is carried into Egypt .
he took his brother by the heel in the womb , and by his strength he had power with God :
ye@@ a , he had power over the angel , and prevailed : he we@@ pt , and made suppl@@ ication unto him : he found him in Be@@ the@@ l , and there he sp@@ ake with us ;
and I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tab@@ ern@@ acles , as in the days of the solemn feast .
and Jacob fled into the country of Syria , and Israel served for a wife , and for a wife he kept sheep .
E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im provoked him to anger most bit@@ terly : therefore shall he leave his blood upon him , and his repro@@ ach shall his Lord return unto him .
therefore I will be unto them as a lion : as a le@@ op@@ ard by the way will I observe them :
I will meet them as a bear that is ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed of her whel@@ ps , and will ren@@ d the c@@ aul of their heart , and there will I dev@@ our them like a lion : the wild beast shall tear them .
though he be fruitful among his brethren , an east wind shall come , the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness , and his spring shall become dry , and his fountain shall be dried up : he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels .
Sam@@ aria shall become des@@ ol@@ ate ; for she hath reb@@ elled against her God : they shall fall by the sword : their infants shall be d@@ ashed in pieces , and their women with child shall be ri@@ pped up .
hear this , ye old men , and give ear , all ye inhabitants of the land . hath this been in your days , or even in the days of your fathers ?
awake , ye drun@@ k@@ ards , and we@@ ep ; and how@@ l , all ye drin@@ kers of wine , because of the new wine ; for it is cut off from your mouth .
for a nation is come up upon my land , strong , and without number , whose teeth are the teeth of a lion , and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion .
he hath laid my vine waste , and bar@@ ked my fi@@ g tree : he hath made it clean bare , and cast it away ; the branches thereof are made white .
be ye ashamed , O ye Hus@@ band@@ men ; how@@ l , O ye vin@@ ed@@ res@@ sers , for the wheat and for the barley ; because the harvest of the field is perished .
sancti@@ fy ye a fast , call a solemn assembly , gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God , and cry unto the LORD ,
how do the beasts gro@@ an ! the herds of cattle are perpl@@ exed , because they have no past@@ ure ; ye@@ a , the f@@ locks of sheep are made des@@ ol@@ ate .
O LORD , to thee will I cry : for the fire hath dev@@ oured the past@@ ures of the wilderness , and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field .
the beasts of the field cry also unto thee : for the rivers of waters are dried up , and the fire hath dev@@ oured the past@@ ures of the wilderness .
blow ye the trum@@ pet in Z@@ ion , and sound an alarm in my holy mountain : let all the inhabitants of the land trem@@ ble : for the day of the LORD com@@ eth , for it is ni@@ gh at hand ;
a fire dev@@ ou@@ re@@ th before them ; and behind them a flame bur@@ neth : the land is as the garden of Eden before them , and behind them a des@@ ol@@ ate wilderness ; ye@@ a , and nothing shall escape them .
like the noise of ch@@ ari@@ ots on the tops of mountains shall they leap , like the noise of a flame of fire that dev@@ ou@@ re@@ th the stub@@ ble , as a strong people set in battle array .
they shall run like mighty men ; they shall climb the wall like men of war ; and they shall march every one on his ways , and they shall not break their ranks :
and the LORD shall utter his voice before his army : for his camp is very great : for he is strong that execut@@ eth his word : for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible ; and who can abide it ?
therefore also now , sa@@ ith the LORD , turn ye even to me with all your heart , and with fasting , and with we@@ eping , and with mourning :
and ren@@ d your heart , and not your garments , and turn unto the LORD your God : for he is gr@@ acious and mer@@ ciful , slow to anger , and of great kindness , and repent@@ eth him of the evil .
who know@@ eth if he will return and repent , and leave a blessing behind him ; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your God ?
gather the people , sancti@@ fy the congregation , assemble the elders , gather the children , and those that su@@ ck the breasts : let the bri@@ deg@@ room go forth of his chamber , and the bride out of her closet .
ye@@ a , the LORD will answer and say unto his people , Be@@ hold , I will send you corn , and wine , and oil , and ye shall be satisfied there@@ with : and I will no more make you a repro@@ ach among the he@@ a@@ then :
and the floors shall be full of wheat , and the fats shall over@@ flow with wine and oil .
and I will restore to you the years that the loc@@ ust hath eaten , the can@@ ker@@ worm , and the cat@@ er@@ pill@@ er , and the pal@@ mer@@ worm , my great army which I sent among you .
and ye shall eat in plenty , and be satisfied , and praise the name of the LORD your God , that hath dealt won@@ dr@@ ously with you : and my people shall never be ashamed .
and ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel , and that I am the LORD your God , and none else : and my people shall never be ashamed .
and it shall come to pass afterward , that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh ; and your sons and your daughters shall proph@@ esy , your old men shall dream dreams , your young men shall see visions :
and I will sh@@ ew wonders in the heavens and in the earth , blood , and fire , and pillars of smoke .
the sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come .
and it shall come to pass , that wh@@ oso@@ ever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered : for in mount Z@@ ion and in Jerusalem shall be deliver@@ ance , as the LORD hath said , and in the remn@@ ant whom the LORD shall call .
I will also gather all nations , and will bring them down into the valley of Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at , and will ple@@ ad with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel , whom they have scattered among the nations , and parted my land .
ye@@ a , and what have ye to do with me , O Ty@@ re , and Z@@ id@@ on , and all the co@@ asts of Palestine ? will ye render me a re@@ comp@@ ence ? and if ye re@@ comp@@ ence me , swiftly and spe@@ ed@@ ily will I return your re@@ comp@@ ence upon your own head ;
proclaim ye this among the Genti@@ les ; Pre@@ p@@ are war , wake up the mighty men , let all the men of war draw near ; let them come up :
let the he@@ a@@ then be w@@ ak@@ ened , and come up to the valley of Je@@ hos@@ ha@@ ph@@ at : for there will I sit to judge all the he@@ a@@ then round about .
put ye in the sick@@ le , for the harvest is ripe : come , get you down ; for the press is full , the fats over@@ flow ; for their w@@ ick@@ edness is great .
the LORD also shall ro@@ ar out of Z@@ ion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem ; and the heavens and the earth shall shake : but the LORD will be the hope of his people , and the strength of the children of Israel .
Egypt shall be a des@@ ol@@ ation , and E@@ dom shall be a des@@ ol@@ ate wilderness , for the violence against the children of Jud@@ ah , because they have shed innocent blood in their land .
the words of A@@ mos , who was among the her@@ d@@ man of Te@@ ko@@ a , which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uz@@ zi@@ ah king of Jud@@ ah , and in the days of J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am the son of Jo@@ ash king of Israel , two years before the earthquake .
and he said , The LORD will ro@@ ar from Z@@ ion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem ; and the hab@@ itations of the shep@@ herds shall mour@@ n , and the top of Car@@ me@@ l shall wi@@ ther .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Gaza , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they carried away captive the whole cap@@ tivity , to deliver them up to E@@ dom :
but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza , which shall dev@@ our the palaces thereof :
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Ty@@ rus , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they delivered up the whole cap@@ tivity to E@@ dom , and remembered not the bro@@ ther@@ ly covenant :
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Mo@@ ab , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because he burned the bones of the king of E@@ dom into lime :
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; For three trans@@ gres@@ sions of Israel , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they sold the righteous for silver , and the poor for a pair of shoes ;
yet destroyed I the A@@ mor@@ ite before them , whose height was like the height of the c@@ ed@@ ars , and he was strong as the o@@ aks ; yet I destroyed his fruit from above , and his roots from beneath .
also I brought you up from the land of Egypt , and led you forty years through the wilderness , to possess the land of the A@@ mor@@ ite .
and I raised up of your sons for prophets , and of your young men for Nazar@@ ites . is it not even thus , O ye children of Israel ? sa@@ ith the LORD .
neither shall he stand that hand@@ let@@ h the bow ; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself : neither shall he that ri@@ det@@ h the horse deliver himself .
and he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day , sa@@ ith the LORD .
hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you , O children of Israel , against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt , saying ,
shall a trum@@ pet be blown in the city , and the people not be afraid ? shall there be evil in a city , and the LORD hath not done it ?
publish in the palaces at Ash@@ do@@ d , and in the palaces in the land of Egypt , and say , assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Sam@@ aria , and behold the great tum@@ ults in the midst thereof , and the oppressed in the midst thereof .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; An adversary there shall be even round about the land ; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee , and thy palaces shall be spoiled .
that in the day that I shall visit the trans@@ gres@@ sions of Israel upon him I will also visit the al@@ t@@ ars of Be@@ the@@ l : and the horns of the altar shall be cut off , and fall to the ground .
and I will sm@@ ite the winter house with the summer house ; and the houses of iv@@ ory shall perish , and the great houses shall have an end , sa@@ ith the LORD .
hear this word , ye k@@ ine of Bash@@ an , that are in the mountain of Sam@@ aria , which op@@ press the poor , which crush the ne@@ edy , which say to their masters , B@@ ring , and let us drink .
for , lo , he that form@@ eth the mountains , and cre@@ at@@ eth the wind , and decla@@ re@@ th unto man what is his thought , that mak@@ eth the morning darkness , and t@@ read@@ eth upon the high places of the earth , The LORD , The God of hosts , is his name .
for thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred , and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten , to the house of Israel .
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD unto the house of Israel , Se@@ ek ye me , and ye shall live :
but seek not Be@@ the@@ l , nor enter into Gil@@ gal , and pass not to Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba : for Gil@@ gal shall surely go into cap@@ tivity , and Be@@ the@@ l shall come to n@@ ought .
seek the LORD , and ye shall live ; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph , and dev@@ our it , and there be none to qu@@ en@@ ch it in Be@@ the@@ l .
that strength@@ en@@ eth the spoiled against the strong , so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress .
for I know your manif@@ old trans@@ gres@@ sions and your mighty sins : they aff@@ l@@ ict the just , they take a bribe , and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right .
shall not the day of the LORD be darkness , and not light ? even very dark , and no brightness in it ?
though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings , I will not accept them : neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts .
take thou away from me the noise of thy songs ; for I will not hear the melody of thy vi@@ ols .
but ye have borne the tab@@ ern@@ acle of your Molo@@ ch and Chi@@ un your images , the star of your god , which ye made to yourselves .
therefore will I cause you to go into cap@@ tivity beyond Damascus , sa@@ ith the LORD , whose name is The God of hosts .
pass ye unto Cal@@ ne@@ h , and see ; and from th@@ ence go ye to Ham@@ ath the great : then go down to G@@ ath of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : be they better than these king@@ doms ? or their border greater than your border ?
ye that put far away the evil day , and cause the seat of violence to come near ;
that lie upon beds of iv@@ ory , and stretch themselves upon their cou@@ ches , and eat the lam@@ bs out of the flock , and the cal@@ ves out of the midst of the stall ;
the Lord GO@@ D hath sworn by himself , sa@@ ith the LORD the God of hosts , I abh@@ or the excell@@ ency of Jacob , and hate his palaces : therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein .
and it shall come to pass , if there remain ten men in one house , that they shall die .
for , behold , the LORD comman@@ det@@ h , and he will sm@@ ite the great house with breaches , and the little house with cle@@ fts .
thus hath the Lord GO@@ D sh@@ ew@@ ed unto me : and , behold , the Lord GO@@ D called to contend by fire , and it dev@@ oured the great deep , and did eat up a part .
then said I , O Lord GO@@ D , cease , I bes@@ e@@ ech thee : by whom shall Jacob arise ? for he is small .
and the LORD said unto me , A@@ mos , what se@@ est thou ? and I said , A plum@@ bl@@ ine . then said the Lord , Be@@ hold , I will set a plum@@ bl@@ ine in the midst of my people Israel : I will not again pass by them any more :
then Ama@@ zi@@ ah the priest of Be@@ the@@ l sent to J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am king of Israel , saying , A@@ mos hath con@@ spi@@ red against thee in the midst of the house of Israel : the land is not able to bear all his words .
also Ama@@ zi@@ ah said unto A@@ mos , O thou se@@ er , go , flee thee away into the land of Jud@@ ah , and there eat bread , and proph@@ esy there :
now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD : thou say@@ est , Proph@@ esy not against Israel , and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac .
and he said , A@@ mos , what se@@ est thou ? and I said , A basket of summer fruit . then said the LORD unto me , The end is come upon my people of Israel ; I will not again pass by them any more .
and the songs of the temple shall be how@@ lings in that day , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D : there shall be many dead bodies in every place ; they shall cast them forth with silence .
shall not the land trem@@ ble for this , and every one mour@@ n that dwell@@ eth therein ? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood ; and it shall be cast out and drowned , as by the flood of Egypt .
behold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D , that I will send a famine in the land , not a famine of bread , nor a thirst for water , but of hearing the words of the LORD :
they that swear by the sin of Sam@@ aria , and say , Th@@ y god , O Dan , liv@@ eth ; and , The manner of Be@@ er @@@ -@@ @ she@@ ba liv@@ eth ; even they shall fall , and never rise up again .
and though they hide themselves in the top of Car@@ me@@ l , I will search and take them out th@@ ence ; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea , th@@ ence will I command the ser@@ pent , and he shall bite them :
and though they go into cap@@ tivity before their enemies , th@@ ence will I command the sword , and it shall sl@@ ay them : and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil , and not for good .
and the Lord GO@@ D of hosts is he that touch@@ eth the land , and it shall melt , and all that dwell therein shall mour@@ n : and it shall rise up wholly like a flood ; and shall be drowned , as by the flood of Egypt .
are ye not as children of the Ethiop@@ ians unto me , O children of Israel ? sa@@ ith the LORD . have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt ? and the Phil@@ ist@@ ines from Cap@@ h@@ tor , and the Syrians from K@@ ir ?
for , lo , I will command , and I will si@@ ft the house of Israel among all nations , like as corn is si@@ fted in a si@@ eve , yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth .
that they may possess the remn@@ ant of E@@ dom , and of all the he@@ a@@ then , which are called by my name , sa@@ ith the LORD that do@@ eth this .
behold , the days come , sa@@ ith the LORD , that the P@@ low@@ man shall over@@ take the re@@ aper , and the T@@ reader of grapes him that s@@ ow@@ eth seed ; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine , and all the hills shall melt .
and I will bring again the cap@@ tivity of my people of Israel , and they shall build the waste cities , and inhabit them ; and they shall plant vineyards , and drink the wine thereof ; they shall also make gardens , and eat the fruit of them .
the vision of Ob@@ adi@@ ah . thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D concerning E@@ dom ; We have heard a rum@@ our from the LORD , and an ambassador is sent among the he@@ a@@ then , A@@ rise ye , and let us rise up against her in battle .
the pride of th@@ ine heart hath deceived thee , thou that dwell@@ est in the cle@@ fts of the rock , whose hab@@ itation is high ; that sa@@ ith in his heart , Who shall bring me down to the ground ?
shall I not in that day , sa@@ ith the LORD , even destroy the wise men out of E@@ dom , and understanding out of the mount of Es@@ au ?
thou shoul@@ dest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity ; ye@@ a , thou shoul@@ dest not have looked on their afflic@@ tion in the day of their calamity , nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity ;
for the day of the LORD is near upon all the he@@ a@@ then : as thou hast done , it shall be done unto thee : thy reward shall return upon th@@ ine own head .
for as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain , so shall all the he@@ a@@ then drink continually , ye@@ a , they shall drink , and they shall swallow down , and they shall be as though they had not been .
and they of the south shall possess the mount of Es@@ au ; and they of the plain the Phil@@ ist@@ ines : and they shall possess the fields of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and the fields of Sam@@ aria : and Benjamin shall possess Gil@@ e@@ ad .
and s@@ avi@@ ours shall come up on mount Z@@ ion to judge the mount of Es@@ au ; and the kingdom shall be the LORD 's .
but Jon@@ ah rose up to flee unto Tar@@ sh@@ ish from the presence of the LORD , and went down to J@@ op@@ pa ; and he found a ship going to Tar@@ sh@@ ish : so he paid the fare thereof , and went down into it , to go with them unto Tar@@ sh@@ ish from the presence of the LORD .
then the mar@@ in@@ ers were afraid , and cried every man unto his god , and cast forth the wa@@ res that were in the ship into the sea , to ligh@@ ten it of them . but Jon@@ ah was gone down into the sides of the ship ; and he lay , and was fast asleep .
so the ship@@ master came to him , and said unto him , What mean@@ est thou , O sle@@ eper ? arise , call upon thy God , if so be that God will think upon us , that we perish not .
and they said every one to his fellow , Come , and let us cast lots , that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us . so they cast lots , and the lot fell upon Jon@@ ah .
then said they unto him , Tell us , we pray thee , for whose cause this evil is upon us ; What is th@@ ine occupation ? and wh@@ ence com@@ est thou ? what is thy country ? and of what people art thou ?
then said they unto him , What shall we do unto thee , that the sea may be calm unto us ? for the sea wrought , and was tem@@ pe@@ stu@@ ous .
and he said unto them , Take me up , and cast me forth into the sea ; so shall the sea be calm unto you : for I know that for my sake this great temp@@ est is upon you .
so they took up Jon@@ ah , and cast him forth into the sea : and the sea ceased from her raging .
I went down to the bot@@ toms of the mountains ; the earth with her bars was about me for ever : yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption , O LORD my God .
so the people of N@@ inev@@ eh believed God , and proclaimed a fast , and put on s@@ ack@@ cloth , from the greatest of them even to the least of them .
but let man and beast be covered with s@@ ack@@ cloth , and cry mi@@ gh@@ tily unto God : ye@@ a , let them turn every one from his evil way , and from the violence that is in their hands .
and God saw their works , that they turned from their evil way ; and God rep@@ ented of the evil , that he had said that he would do unto them ; and he did it not .
so Jon@@ ah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made him a booth , and sat under it in the shadow , till he might see what would become of the city .
and the LORD God prepared a gour@@ d , and made it to come up over Jon@@ ah , that it might be a shadow over his head , to deliver him from his grief . so Jon@@ ah was exceeding glad of the gour@@ d .
and it came to pass , when the sun did arise , that God prepared a ve@@ h@@ ement east wind ; and the sun beat upon the head of Jon@@ ah , that he fain@@ ted , and wished in himself to die , and said , It is better for me to die than to live .
and God said to Jon@@ ah , do@@ est thou well to be angry for the gour@@ d ? and he said , I do well to be angry , even unto death .
then said the LORD , Th@@ ou hast had pity on the gour@@ d , for the which thou hast not lab@@ oured , neither mad@@ est it grow ; which came up in a night , and perished in a night :
the word of the LORD that came to Mic@@ ah the Mor@@ asth@@ ite in the days of Jo@@ th@@ am , A@@ haz , and He@@ ze@@ ki@@ ah , kings of Jud@@ ah , which he saw concerning Sam@@ aria and Jerusalem .
for the trans@@ g@@ ression of Jacob is all this , and for the sins of the house of Israel . what is the trans@@ g@@ ression of Jacob ? is it not Sam@@ aria ? and what are the high places of Jud@@ ah ? are they not Jerusalem ?
pass ye away , thou inhabit@@ ant of S@@ aph@@ ir , having thy shame naked : the inhabit@@ ant of Za@@ an@@ an came not forth in the mourning of B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ ez@@ el ; he shall receive of you his standing .
for the inhabit@@ ant of Mar@@ o@@ th waited carefully for good : but evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem .
yet will I bring an heir unto thee , O inhabit@@ ant of Ma@@ resha@@ h : he shall come unto Ad@@ ul@@ lam the glory of Israel .
w@@ oe to them that devise ini@@ qu@@ ity , and work evil upon their beds ! when the morning is light , they practi@@ se it , because it is in the power of their hand .
and they co@@ vet fields , and take them by violence ; and houses , and take them away : so they op@@ press a man and his house , even a man and his heritage .
O thou that art named the house of Jacob , is the spirit of the LORD stra@@ it@@ ened ? are these his do@@ ings ? do not my words do good to him that wal@@ ket@@ h upri@@ gh@@ tly ?
the women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses ; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever .
arise ye , and depart ; for this is not your rest : because it is polluted , it shall destroy you , even with a sore destruction .
who hate the good , and love the evil ; who pl@@ uck off their skin from off them , and their flesh from off their bones ;
who also eat the flesh of my people , and fl@@ ay their skin from off them ; and they break their bones , and cho@@ p them in pieces , as for the pot , and as flesh within the cal@@ dr@@ on .
then shall they cry unto the LORD , but he will not hear them : he will even hide his face from them at that time , as they have behaved themselves ill in their do@@ ings .
therefore shall Z@@ ion for your sake be pl@@ owed as a field , and Jerusalem shall become he@@ aps , and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest .
and he shall judge among many people , and rebu@@ ke strong nations af@@ ar off ; and they shall beat their s@@ words into pl@@ ow@@ shares , and their spe@@ ars into pr@@ un@@ in@@ gh@@ oo@@ ks : nation shall not lift up a sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fi@@ g tree ; and none shall make them afraid : for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken it .
for all people will walk every one in the name of his god , and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever .
but they know not the thoughts of the LORD , neither understand they his counsel : for he shall gather them as the she@@ aves into the floor .
therefore will he give them up , until the time that she which tr@@ avail@@ eth hath brought forth : then the remn@@ ant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel .
and he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD , in the maj@@ esty of the name of the LORD his God ; and they shall abide : for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth .
and this man shall be the peace , when the As@@ sy@@ rian shall come into our land : and when he shall t@@ read in our palaces , then shall we raise against him seven shep@@ herds , and eight principal men .
and they shall waste the land of As@@ sy@@ ria with the sword , and the land of N@@ im@@ rod in the entr@@ ances thereof : thus shall he deliver us from the As@@ sy@@ rian , when he com@@ eth into our land , and when he t@@ read@@ eth within our borders .
and the remn@@ ant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a de@@ w from the LORD , as the showers upon the grass , that tar@@ ri@@ eth not for man , nor wa@@ it@@ eth for the sons of men .
and I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the he@@ a@@ then , such as they have not heard .
hear ye now what the LORD sa@@ ith ; A@@ rise , contend thou before the mountains , and let the hills hear thy voice .
hear ye , O mountains , the LORD 's controversy , and ye strong foundations of the earth : for the LORD hath a controversy with his people , and he will ple@@ ad with Israel .
O my people , what have I done unto thee ? and where@@ in have I wear@@ ied thee ? testify against me .
where@@ with shall I come before the LORD , and bow myself before the high God ? shall I come before him with burnt offerings , with cal@@ ves of a year old ?
will the LORD be pleased with thousands of r@@ ams , or with ten thousands of rivers of oil ? shall I give my fir@@ st@@ born for my trans@@ g@@ ression , the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul ?
he hath sh@@ ew@@ ed thee , O man , what is good ; and what do@@ th the LORD require of thee , but to do justly , and to love mercy , and to walk hum@@ bly with thy God ?
the LORD 's voice cri@@ eth unto the city , and the man of wisdom shall see thy name : hear ye the rod , and who hath appointed it .
are there yet the treasures of w@@ ick@@ edness in the house of the wicked , and the sc@@ ant measure that is ab@@ om@@ in@@ able ?
thou shalt sow , but thou shalt not reap ; thou shalt t@@ read the oli@@ ves , but thou shalt not ano@@ int thee with oil ; and sweet wine , but shalt not drink wine .
for the statutes of Om@@ ri are kept , and all the works of the house of A@@ hab , and ye walk in their coun@@ sels ; that I should make thee a des@@ ol@@ ation , and the inhabitants thereof an his@@ sing : therefore ye shall bear the repro@@ ach of my people .
the good man is perished out of the earth : and there is none upright among men : they all lie in wait for blood ; they hunt every man his brother with a net .
the best of them is as a bri@@ er : the most upright is shar@@ per than a thor@@ n hedge : the day of thy watch@@ men and thy vis@@ itation com@@ eth ; now shall be their perpl@@ ex@@ ity .
therefore I will look unto the LORD ; I will wait for the God of my salvation : my God will hear me .
rejoice not against me , O mine enemy : when I fall , I shall arise ; when I sit in darkness , the LORD shall be a light unto me .
then she that is mine enemy shall see it , and shame shall cover her which said unto me , Where is the LORD thy God ? mine eyes shall behold her : now shall she be tro@@ dden down as the mire of the streets .
in that day also he shall come even to thee from As@@ sy@@ ria , and from the fortified cities , and from the fortress even to the river , and from sea to sea , and from mountain to mountain .
feed thy people with thy rod , the flock of th@@ ine heritage , which dwell sol@@ it@@ arily in the wood , in the midst of Car@@ me@@ l : let them feed in Bash@@ an and Gil@@ e@@ ad , as in the days of old .
according to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt will I sh@@ ew unto him marv@@ ell@@ ous things .
the nations shall see and be conf@@ ounded at all their might : they shall lay their hand upon their mouth , their ears shall be deaf .
who is a God like unto thee , that par@@ don@@ eth ini@@ qu@@ ity , and pass@@ eth by the trans@@ g@@ ression of the remn@@ ant of his heritage ? he ret@@ ain@@ eth not his anger for ever , because he deli@@ ght@@ eth in mercy .
thou wil@@ t perform the truth to Jacob , and the mercy to Abraham , which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old .
God is jeal@@ ous , and the LORD rev@@ eng@@ eth ; the LORD rev@@ eng@@ eth , and is furious ; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries , and he reserv@@ eth wrath for his enemies .
he rebu@@ ket@@ h the sea , and mak@@ eth it dry , and dri@@ eth up all the rivers : Bash@@ an langu@@ ish@@ eth , and Car@@ me@@ l , and the flower of Lebanon langu@@ ish@@ eth .
the mountains quake at him , and the hills melt , and the earth is burned at his presence , ye@@ a , the world , and all that dwell therein .
who can stand before his indignation ? and who can abide in the fierc@@ eness of his anger ? his fury is poured out like fire , and the rocks are thrown down by him .
what do ye imagine against the LORD ? he will make an utter end : afflic@@ tion shall not rise up the second time .
for while they be fol@@ den together as thor@@ ns , and while they are drun@@ ken as drun@@ k@@ ards , they shall be dev@@ oured as stub@@ ble fully dry .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD : though they be quiet , and likewise many , yet thus shall they be cut down , when he shall pass through . though I have afflicted thee , I will aff@@ l@@ ict thee no more .
behold upon the mountains the feet of him that br@@ ing@@ eth good ti@@ dings , that publis@@ h@@ eth peace ! O Jud@@ ah , keep thy solemn fe@@ asts , perform thy v@@ ows : for the wicked shall no more pass through thee ; he is utterly cut off .
for the LORD hath turned away the excell@@ ency of Jacob , as the excell@@ ency of Israel : for the emp@@ tiers have emp@@ tied them out , and mar@@ red their vine branches .
the ch@@ ari@@ ots shall rage in the streets , they shall ju@@ st@@ le one against another in the broad ways : they shall seem like tor@@ ches , they shall run like the light@@ nings .
he shall recoun@@ t his worth@@ ies : they shall stum@@ ble in their walk ; they shall make hast to the wall thereof , and the defence shall be prepared .
and Hu@@ zz@@ ab shall be led away captive , she shall be brought up , and her m@@ aids shall lead her as with the voice of d@@ oves , tab@@ ering upon their breasts .
she is empty , and void , and waste : and the heart mel@@ t@@ eth , and the knees sm@@ ite together , and much pain is in all lo@@ ins , and the faces of them all gather black@@ ness .
where is the dwelling of the lions , and the feed@@ ing@@ place of the young lions , where the lion , even the old lion , walked , and the lion 's whel@@ p , and none made them afraid ?
the lion did tear in pieces enough for his whel@@ ps , and strang@@ led for his lion@@ esses , and filled his holes with prey , and his dens with rav@@ in .
because of the multitude of the wh@@ ore@@ doms of the well@@ fav@@ oured har@@ lot , the mistress of wit@@ ch@@ crafts , that sel@@ let@@ h nations through her wh@@ ore@@ doms , and families through her wit@@ ch@@ crafts .
behold , I am against thee , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts ; and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face , and I will sh@@ ew the nations thy n@@ ak@@ edness , and the king@@ doms thy shame .
and it shall come to pass , that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee , and say , N@@ inev@@ eh is laid waste : who will b@@ emo@@ an her ? wh@@ ence shall I seek comfor@@ ters for thee ?
art thou better than populous No , that was situ@@ ate among the rivers , that had the waters round about it , whose ram@@ part was the sea , and her wall was from the sea ?
yet was she carried away , she went into cap@@ tivity : her young children also were d@@ ashed in pieces at the top of all the streets : and they cast lots for her hon@@ our@@ able men , and all her great men were bound in chains .
all thy strong holds shall be like fi@@ g trees with the fir@@ stri@@ pe fi@@ gs : if they be shaken , they shall even fall into the mouth of the e@@ ater .
behold , thy people in the midst of thee are women : the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto th@@ ine enemies : the fire shall dev@@ our thy bars .
there shall the fire dev@@ our thee ; the sword shall cut thee off , it shall eat thee up like the can@@ ker@@ worm : make thy@@ self many as the can@@ ker@@ worm , make thy@@ self many as the lo@@ cu@@ sts .
thy shep@@ herds sl@@ umber , O king of As@@ sy@@ ria : thy no@@ bles shall dwell in the dust : thy people is scattered upon the mountains , and no man gather@@ eth them .
there is no healing of thy bru@@ ise ; thy wound is griev@@ ous : all that hear the bru@@ it of thee shall cl@@ ap the hands over thee : for upon whom hath not thy w@@ ick@@ edness passed continually ?
why d@@ ost thou sh@@ ew me ini@@ qu@@ ity , and cause me to behold griev@@ ance ? for spo@@ iling and violence are before me : and there are that raise up strife and contention .
for , lo , I raise up the Chal@@ de@@ ans , that bitter and ha@@ sty nation , which shall march through the breadth of the land , to possess the dwell@@ ing@@ places that are not theirs .
and they shall sco@@ ff at the kings , and the princes shall be a scor@@ n unto them : they shall der@@ ide every strong hold ; for they shall heap dust , and take it .
then shall his mind change , and he shall pass over , and offend , imp@@ uting this his power unto his god .
art thou not from everlasting , O LORD my God , mine Holy One ? we shall not die . O LORD , thou hast ordained them for judgment ; and , O mighty God , thou hast established them for correction .
and mak@@ est men as the f@@ ishes of the sea , as the cre@@ eping things , that have no ruler over them ?
they take up all of them with the angle , they catch them in their net , and gather them in their drag : therefore they rejoice and are glad .
I will stand upon my watch , and set me upon the tower , and will watch to see what he will say unto me , and what I shall answer when I am re@@ proved .
and the LORD answered me , and said , Write the vision , and make it plain upon tables , that he may run that read@@ eth it .
for the vision is yet for an appointed time , but at the end it shall speak , and not lie : though it tar@@ ry , wait for it ; because it will surely come , it will not tar@@ ry .
because thou hast spoiled many nations , all the remn@@ ant of the people shall spoil thee ; because of men 's blood , and for the violence of the land , of the city , and of all that dwell therein .
w@@ oe to him that co@@ vet@@ eth an evil co@@ vet@@ ousness to his house , that he may set his nest on high , that he may be delivered from the power of evil !
behold , is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire , and the people shall weary themselves for very van@@ ity ?
w@@ oe unto him that gi@@ v@@ eth his neighbour drink , that put@@ test thy bottle to him , and mak@@ est him drun@@ ken also , that thou may@@ est look on their n@@ ak@@ edness !
thou art filled with shame for glory : drink thou also , and let thy fores@@ kin be uncovered : the cup of the LORD 's right hand shall be turned unto thee , and shameful spe@@ wing shall be on thy glory .
O LORD , I have heard thy speech , and was afraid : O LORD , revive thy work in the midst of the years , in the midst of the years make known ; in wrath remember mercy .
God came from Tem@@ an , and the Holy One from mount Par@@ an . Sel@@ ah . his glory covered the heavens , and the earth was full of his praise .
and his brightness was as the light ; he had horns coming out of his hand : and there was the hiding of his power .
he stood , and measured the earth : he be@@ held , and drove as@@ under the nations ; and the everlasting mountains were scattered , the perpetual hills did bow : his ways are everlasting .
thou did@@ st strike through with his st@@ aves the head of his villages : they came out as a whir@@ l@@ wind to sc@@ atter me : their rejo@@ icing was as to dev@@ our the poor secretly .
although the fi@@ g tree shall not blos@@ som , neither shall fruit be in the v@@ ines ; the labour of the olive shall fail , and the fields shall yield no meat ; the flock shall be cut off from the fold , and there shall be no herd in the st@@ alls :
the word of the LORD which came unto Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah the son of C@@ ush@@ i , the son of G@@ ed@@ ali@@ ah , the son of A@@ mari@@ ah , the son of Hiz@@ ki@@ ah , in the days of Jo@@ si@@ ah the son of Am@@ on , king of Jud@@ ah .
and them that worship the host of heaven upon the hous@@ et@@ ops ; and them that worship and that swear by the LORD , and that swear by Mal@@ cha@@ m ;
in the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the threshold , which fill their masters ' houses with violence and dece@@ it .
how@@ l , ye inhabitants of Mak@@ t@@ esh , for all the merchant people are cut down ; all they that bear silver are cut off .
and it shall come to pass at that time , that I will search Jerusalem with candles , and punish the men that are settled on their le@@ es : that say in their heart , The LORD will not do good , neither will he do evil .
the great day of the LORD is near , it is near , and ha@@ st@@ eth greatly , even the voice of the day of the LORD : the mighty man shall cry there bit@@ terly .
that day is a day of wrath , a day of trouble and distress , a day of w@@ ast@@ eness and des@@ ol@@ ation , a day of darkness and glo@@ om@@ iness , a day of clouds and thick darkness ,
a day of the trum@@ pet and alarm against the f@@ enced cities , and against the high towers .
and I will bring distress upon men , that they shall walk like blind men , because they have sin@@ ned against the LORD : and their blood shall be poured out as dust , and their flesh as the d@@ ung .
neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD 's wrath ; but the whole land shall be dev@@ oured by the fire of his jealousy : for he shall make even a speedy rid@@ dance of all them that dwell in the land .
before the decree bring forth , before the day pass as the cha@@ ff , before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you , before the day of the LORD 's anger come upon you .
seek ye the LORD , all ye me@@ ek of the earth , which have wrought his judgment ; seek righteousness , seek me@@ ek@@ ness : it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORD 's anger .
and the coast shall be for the remn@@ ant of the house of Jud@@ ah ; they shall feed there@@ upon : in the houses of Ash@@ kel@@ on shall they lie down in the evening : for the LORD their God shall visit them , and turn away their cap@@ tivity .
I have heard the repro@@ ach of Mo@@ ab , and the re@@ vil@@ ings of the children of Am@@ mon , whereby they have repro@@ ached my people , and magni@@ fied themselves against their border .
this shall they have for their pride , because they have repro@@ ached and magni@@ fied themselves against the people of the LORD of hosts .
her prophets are light and treach@@ erous persons : her priests have polluted the sanctuary , they have done violence to the law .
I have cut off the nations : their towers are des@@ ol@@ ate ; I made their streets waste , that none pass@@ eth by : their cities are destroyed , so that there is no man , that there is none inhabit@@ ant .
from beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppl@@ i@@ ants , even the daughter of my dispersed , shall bring mine offering .
the remn@@ ant of Israel shall not do ini@@ qu@@ ity , nor speak lies ; neither shall a dece@@ it@@ ful tongue be found in their mouth : for they shall feed and lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
sing , O daughter of Z@@ ion ; shout , O Israel ; be glad and rejoice with all the heart , O daughter of Jerusalem .
the LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty ; he will save , he will rejoice over thee with joy ; he will rest in his love , he will joy over thee with singing .
at that time will I bring you again , even in the time that I gather you : for I will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth , when I turn back your cap@@ tivity before your eyes , sa@@ ith the LORD .
in the second year of D@@ arius the king , in the sixth month , in the first day of the month , came the word of the LORD by H@@ agg@@ ai the prophet unto Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el the son of S@@ heal@@ ti@@ el , governor of Jud@@ ah , and to Joshua the son of Jos@@ ed@@ ech , the high priest , saying ,
thus spe@@ ak@@ eth the LORD of hosts , saying , This people say , The time is not come , the time that the LORD 's house should be built .
go up to the mountain , and bring wood , and build the house ; and I will take pleasure in it , and I will be glori@@ fied , sa@@ ith the LORD .
then sp@@ ake H@@ agg@@ ai the LORD 's messenger in the LORD 's message unto the people , saying , I am with you , sa@@ ith the LORD .
and I will shake all nations , and the desire of all nations shall come : and I will fill this house with glory , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts : and in this place will I give peace , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
then answered H@@ agg@@ ai , and said , So is this people , and so is this nation before me , sa@@ ith the LORD ; and so is every work of their hands ; and that which they offer there is un@@ clean .
and now , I pray you , consider from this day and upward , from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD :
since those days were , when one came to an heap of twenty measures , there were but ten : when one came to the press@@ fat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press , there were but twenty .
I smo@@ te you with b@@ lasting and with mil@@ de@@ w and with hail in all the lab@@ ours of your hands ; yet ye turned not to me , sa@@ ith the LORD .
is the seed yet in the bar@@ n ? ye@@ a , as yet the vine , and the fi@@ g tree , and the p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate , and the olive tree , hath not brought forth : from this day will I bless you .
and again the word of the LORD came unto H@@ agg@@ ai in the four and twentieth day of the month , saying ,
in that day , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , will I take thee , O Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el , my servant , the son of S@@ heal@@ ti@@ el , sa@@ ith the LORD , and will make thee as a sig@@ net : for I have chosen thee , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
therefore say thou unto them , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts ; Turn ye unto me , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , and I will turn unto you , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month , which is the month Se@@ bat , in the second year of D@@ arius , came the word of the LORD unto Z@@ ech@@ ari@@ ah , the son of Ber@@ ec@@ hi@@ ah , the son of Id@@ do the prophet , saying ,
I saw by night , and behold a man riding upon a red horse , and he stood among the my@@ r@@ tle trees that were in the bottom ; and behind him were there red horses , spec@@ k@@ led , and white .
then said I , O my lord , what are these ? and the angel that talked with me said unto me , I will sh@@ ew thee what these be .
and the man that stood among the my@@ r@@ tle trees answered and said , These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth .
then the angel of the LORD answered and said , O LORD of hosts , how long wil@@ t thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Jud@@ ah , against which thou hast had indignation these thre@@ es@@ core and ten years ?
so the angel that commun@@ ed with me said unto me , C@@ ry thou , saying , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts ; I am jeal@@ ous for Jerusalem and for Z@@ ion with a great jealousy .
and I am very sore dis@@ pleased with the he@@ a@@ then that are at ease : for I was but a little dis@@ pleased , and they helped forward the afflic@@ tion .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; I am returned to Jerusalem with mer@@ cies : my house shall be built in it , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem .
cry yet , saying , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts ; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad ; and the LORD shall yet comfort Z@@ ion , and shall yet choose Jerusalem .
and I said unto the angel that talked with me , What be these ? and he answered me , These are the horns which have scattered Jud@@ ah , Israel , and Jerusalem .
then said I , whi@@ ther go@@ est thou ? and he said unto me , To measure Jerusalem , to see what is the breadth thereof , and what is the length thereof .
and said unto him , Run , speak to this young man , saying , Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein :
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts ; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you : for he that touch@@ eth you touch@@ eth the apple of his eye .
for , behold , I will shake mine hand upon them , and they shall be a spoil to their servants : and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me .
sing and rejoice , O daughter of Z@@ ion : for , lo , I come , and I will dwell in the midst of thee , sa@@ ith the LORD .
and many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day , and shall be my people : and I will dwell in the midst of thee , and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee .
be silent , O all flesh , before the LORD : for he is raised up out of his holy hab@@ itation .
and the LORD said unto Satan , The LORD rebu@@ ke thee , O Satan ; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebu@@ ke thee : is not this a brand pl@@ ucked out of the fire ?
and he answered and sp@@ ake unto those that stood before him , saying , Take away the fil@@ thy garments from him . and unto him he said , Be@@ hold , I have caused th@@ ine ini@@ qu@@ ity to pass from thee , and I will clo@@ the thee with change of ra@@ iment .
and I said , Let them set a fair mit@@ re upon his head . so they set a fair mit@@ re upon his head , and clo@@ thed him with garments . and the angel of the LORD stood by .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts ; If thou wil@@ t walk in my ways , and if thou wil@@ t keep my charge , then thou shalt also judge my house , and shalt also keep my courts , and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by .
hear now , O Joshua the high priest , thou , and thy fellows that sit before thee : for they are men wondered at : for , behold , I will bring forth my servant the BR@@ AN@@ CH .
for behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua ; upon one stone shall be seven eyes : behold , I will engra@@ ve the gra@@ ving thereof , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , and I will remove the ini@@ qu@@ ity of that land in one day .
and two olive trees by it , one upon the right side of the bowl , and the other upon the left side thereof .
so I answered and sp@@ ake to the angel that talked with me , saying , What are these , my lord ?
then he answered and sp@@ ake unto me , saying , This is the word of the LORD unto Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el , saying , Not by might , nor by power , but by my spirit , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
the hands of Zer@@ ub@@ bab@@ el have laid the foundation of this house ; his hands shall also finish it ; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you .
then answered I , and said unto him , What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the cand@@ les@@ tick and upon the left side thereof ?
and I answered again , and said unto him , What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves ?
then said he , These are the two ano@@ inted ones , that stand by the LORD of the whole earth .
and he said unto me , What se@@ est thou ? and I answered , I see a flying roll ; the length thereof is twenty cub@@ its , and the breadth thereof ten cub@@ its .
I will bring it forth , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , and it shall enter into the house of the thief , and into the house of him that swe@@ areth fal@@ sely by my name : and it shall remain in the midst of his house , and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof .
then the angel that talked with me went forth , and said unto me , Lift up now th@@ ine eyes , and see what is this that go@@ eth forth .
and I said , What is it ? and he said , This is an ep@@ ha@@ h that go@@ eth forth . he said moreover , This is their resemblance through all the earth .
and he said , This is w@@ ick@@ edness . and he cast it into the midst of the ep@@ ha@@ h ; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof .
then lifted I up mine eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came out two women , and the wind was in their wings ; for they had wings like the wings of a stor@@ k : and they lifted up the ep@@ ha@@ h between the earth and the heaven .
and I turned , and lifted up mine eyes , and looked , and , behold , there came four ch@@ ari@@ ots out from between two mountains ; and the mountains were mountains of brass .
then cried he upon me , and sp@@ ake unto me , saying , Be@@ hold , these that go toward the north country have qui@@ eted my spirit in the north country .
take of them of the cap@@ tivity , even of Hel@@ d@@ ai , of Tob@@ i@@ jah , and of J@@ ed@@ aiah , which are come from Babylon , and come thou the same day , and go into the house of Jo@@ si@@ ah the son of Z@@ ep@@ han@@ i@@ ah ;
even he shall build the temple of the LORD ; and he shall bear the glory , and shall sit and rule upon his throne ; and he shall be a priest upon his throne : and the counsel of peace shall be between them both .
and they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD , and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you . and this shall come to pass , if ye will dilig@@ ently obey the voice of the LORD your God .
and to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the LORD of hosts , and to the prophets , saying , Should I we@@ ep in the fifth month , separating myself , as I have done these so many years ?
speak unto all the people of the land , and to the priests , saying , When ye fast@@ ed and mour@@ ned in the fifth and seventh month , even those seventy years , did ye at all fast unto me , even to me ?
should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets , when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity , and the cities thereof round about her , when men inhabited the south and the plain ?
thus spe@@ ak@@ eth the LORD of hosts , saying , Exec@@ ute true judgment , and sh@@ ew mercy and comp@@ as@@ sions every man to his brother :
therefore it is come to pass , that as he cried , and they would not hear ; so they cried , and I would not hear , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts :
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; I am returned unto Z@@ ion , and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem : and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth ; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts ; There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem , and every man with his staff in his hand for very age .
and the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof .
thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts ; If it be marv@@ ell@@ ous in the eyes of the remn@@ ant of this people in these days , should it also be marv@@ ell@@ ous in mine eyes ? sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
and I will bring them , and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem : and they shall be my people , and I will be their God , in truth and in righteousness .
for the seed shall be prosperous ; the vine shall give her fruit , and the ground shall give her increase , and the heavens shall give their de@@ w ; and I will cause the remn@@ ant of this people to possess all these things .
and it shall come to pass , that as ye were a curse among the he@@ a@@ then , O house of Jud@@ ah , and house of Israel ; so will I save you , and ye shall be a blessing : fear not , but let your hands be strong .
for thus sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts ; As I thought to punish you , when your fathers provoked me to wrath , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , and I rep@@ ented not :
so again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Jud@@ ah : fear ye not .
these are the things that ye shall do ; Spe@@ ak ye every man the truth to his neighbour ; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates :
and the inhabitants of one city shall go to another , saying , Let us go spe@@ ed@@ ily to pray before the LORD , and to seek the LORD of hosts : I will go also .
the burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Had@@ r@@ ach , and Damascus shall be the rest thereof : when the eyes of man , as of all the tribes of Israel , shall be toward the LORD .
and Ty@@ rus did build herself a strong hold , and he@@ aped up silver as the dust , and fine gold as the mire of the streets .
behold , the Lord will cast her out , and he will sm@@ ite her power in the sea ; and she shall be dev@@ oured with fire .
Ash@@ kel@@ on shall see it , and fear ; Gaza also shall see it , and be very sor@@ row@@ ful , and Ek@@ ron ; for her expectation shall be ashamed ; and the king shall perish from Gaza , and Ash@@ kel@@ on shall not be inhabited .
and a b@@ ast@@ ard shall dwell in Ash@@ do@@ d , and I will cut off the pride of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines .
and I will enc@@ amp about mine house because of the army , because of him that pass@@ eth by , and because of him that re@@ tur@@ neth : and no op@@ pres@@ sor shall pass through them any more : for now have I seen with mine eyes .
rejoice greatly , O daughter of Z@@ ion ; shout , O daughter of Jerusalem : behold , thy King com@@ eth unto thee : he is just , and having salvation ; low@@ ly , and riding upon an ass , and upon a col@@ t the fo@@ al of an ass .
when I have bent Jud@@ ah for me , filled the bow with E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im , and raised up thy sons , O Z@@ ion , against thy sons , O Greece , and made thee as the sword of a mighty man .
and the LORD shall be seen over them , and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning : and the LORD GO@@ D shall blow the trum@@ pet , and shall go with whir@@ l@@ winds of the south .
the LORD of hosts shall defend them ; and they shall dev@@ our , and sub@@ due with s@@ ling stones ; and they shall drink , and make a noise as through wine ; and they shall be filled like bow@@ ls , and as the corners of the altar .
and the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people : for they shall be as the stones of a crown , lifted up as an en@@ sign upon his land .
for how great is his goodness , and how great is his beauty ! corn shall make the young men cheerful , and new wine the m@@ aids .
for the idols have spoken van@@ ity , and the div@@ in@@ ers have seen a lie , and have told false dreams ; they comfort in vain : therefore they went their way as a flock , they were troubled , because there was no shepherd .
mine anger was kind@@ led against the shep@@ herds , and I punished the goats : for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Jud@@ ah , and hath made them as his goo@@ dly horse in the battle .
and they shall be as mighty men , which t@@ read down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle : and they shall fight , because the LORD is with them , and the riders on horses shall be conf@@ ounded .
and they of E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im shall be like a mighty man , and their heart shall rejoice as through wine : ye@@ a , their children shall see it , and be glad ; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD .
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt , and gather them out of As@@ sy@@ ria ; and I will bring them into the land of Gil@@ e@@ ad and Lab@@ an@@ on ; and place shall not be found for them .
and I will strengthen them in the LORD ; and they shall walk up and down in his name , sa@@ ith the LORD .
whose poss@@ essors sl@@ ay them , and hold themselves not guilty : and they that sell them say , Bless@@ ed be the LORD ; for I am rich : and their own shep@@ herds pity them not .
and I will feed the flock of slaughter , even you , O poor of the flock . and I took unto me two st@@ aves ; the one I called Beauty , and the other I called B@@ ands ; and I fed the flock .
and I took my staff , even Beauty , and cut it ass@@ under , that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people .
and it was broken in that day : and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD .
and the LORD said unto me , C@@ ast it unto the pot@@ ter : a goo@@ dly price that I was prised at of them . and I took the thirty pieces of silver , and cast them to the pot@@ ter in the house of the LORD .
behold , I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about , when they shall be in the siege both against Jud@@ ah and against Jerusalem .
and in that day will I make Jerusalem a bur@@ den@@ some stone for all people : all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces , though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it .
and the governors of Jud@@ ah shall say in their heart , The inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of hosts their God .
in that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem ; and he that is fee@@ ble among them at that day shall be as David ; and the house of David shall be as God , as the angel of the LORD before them .
in that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem , as the mourning of Had@@ ad@@ ri@@ m@@ mon in the valley of Me@@ gi@@ d@@ don .
and the land shall mour@@ n , every family apart ; the family of the house of David apart , and their wives apart ; the family of the house of Na@@ than apart , and their wives apart ;
the family of the house of Lev@@ i apart , and their wives apart ; the family of Shim@@ ei apart , and their wives apart ;
and it shall come to pass in that day , that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision , when he hath prophe@@ si@@ ed ; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive :
and one shall say unto him , What are these wounds in th@@ ine hands ? then he shall answer , Th@@ ose with which I was wounded in the house of my friends .
awake , O sword , against my shepherd , and against the man that is my fellow , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts : sm@@ ite the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered : and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones .
and it shall come to pass , that in all the land , sa@@ ith the LORD , two parts therein shall be cut off and die ; but the third shall be left therein .
for I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle ; and the city shall be taken , and the houses ri@@ fled , and the women ra@@ vis@@ hed ; and half of the city shall go forth into cap@@ tivity , and the resi@@ due of the people shall not be cut off from the city .
and it shall be in that day , that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem ; half of them toward the former sea , and half of them toward the hinder sea : in summer and in winter shall it be .
and Jud@@ ah also shall fight at Jerusalem ; and the wealth of all the he@@ a@@ then round about shall be gathered together , gold , and silver , and app@@ arel , in great abundance .
and so shall be the plague of the horse , of the mu@@ le , of the cam@@ el , and of the ass , and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents , as this plague .
and it shall be , that wh@@ os@@ o will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King , the LORD of hosts , even upon them shall be no rain .
and if the family of Egypt go not up , and come not , that have no rain ; there shall be the plague , where@@ with the LORD will sm@@ ite the he@@ a@@ then that come not up to keep the feast of tab@@ ern@@ acles .
this shall be the punishment of Egypt , and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tab@@ ern@@ acles .
in that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses , HO@@ LIN@@ E@@ SS UN@@ TO THE LORD ; and the pots in the LORD 's house shall be like the bowl 's before the altar .
ye@@ a , every pot in Jerusalem and in Jud@@ ah shall be hol@@ iness unto the LORD of hosts : and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them , and see@@ the therein : and in that day there shall be no more the Can@@ a@@ an@@ ite in the house of the LORD of hosts .
and now , I pray you , bes@@ e@@ ech God that he will be gr@@ acious unto us : this hath been by your means : will he regard your persons ? sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
and ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you , that my covenant might be with Lev@@ i , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
the law of truth was in his mouth , and ini@@ qu@@ ity was not found in his lips : he walked with me in peace and equity , and did turn many away from ini@@ qu@@ ity .
for the priest 's lips should keep knowledge , and they should seek the law at his mouth : for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts .
but ye are departed out of the way ; ye have caused many to stum@@ ble at the law ; ye have corrupted the covenant of Lev@@ i , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
Jud@@ ah hath dealt treach@@ er@@ ously , and an ab@@ om@@ ination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem ; for Jud@@ ah hath prof@@ an@@ ed the hol@@ iness of the LORD which he loved , and hath married the daughter of a strange god .
the LORD will cut off the man that do@@ eth this , the master and the scholar , out of the tab@@ ern@@ acles of Jacob , and him that off@@ er@@ eth an offering unto the LORD of hosts .
and this have ye done again , covering the altar of the LORD with tears , with we@@ eping , and with crying out , in@@ som@@ uch that he regar@@ det@@ h not the offering any more , or recei@@ v@@ eth it with good will at your hand .
for the LORD , the God of Israel , sa@@ ith that he hat@@ eth putting away : for one cover@@ eth violence with his garment , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts : therefore take heed to your spirit , that ye deal not treach@@ er@@ ously .
behold , I will send my messenger , and he shall prepare the way before me : and the Lord , whom ye seek , shall suddenly come to this temple , even the messenger of the covenant , whom ye delight in : behold , he shall come , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
but who may abide the day of his coming ? and who shall stand when he appe@@ areth ? for he is like a refin@@ er 's fire , and like Ful@@ lers ' soap :
and he shall sit as a refin@@ er and puri@@ fer of silver : and he shall puri@@ fy the sons of Lev@@ i , and purge them as gold and silver , that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness .
even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordin@@ ances , and have not kept them . return unto me , and I will return unto you , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts . but ye said , W@@ herein shall we return ?
your words have been st@@ out against me , sa@@ ith the LORD . yet ye say , What have we spoken so much against thee ?
ye have said , It is vain to serve God : and what profit is it that we have kept his ordin@@ ance , and that we have walked mour@@ n@@ fully before the LORD of hosts ?
then they that feared the LORD sp@@ ake often one to another : and the LORD hear@@ k@@ ened , and heard it , and a book of rem@@ embrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD , and that thought upon his name .
and they shall be mine , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts , in that day when I make up my jew@@ els ; and I will spare them , as a man sp@@ areth his own son that serv@@ eth him .
then shall ye return , and discern between the righteous and the wicked , between him that serv@@ eth God and him that serv@@ eth him not .
but unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings ; and ye shall go forth , and grow up as cal@@ ves of the stall .
and ye shall t@@ read down the wicked ; for they shall be ashes under the sol@@ es of your feet in the day that I shall do this , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children , and the heart of the children to their fathers , lest I come and sm@@ ite the earth with a curse .
so all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations ; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations ; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations .
now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise : when as his mother Mary was esp@@ oused to Joseph , before they came together , she was found with child of the Holy Ghost .
and she shall bring forth a son , and thou shalt call his name J@@ ES@@ US : for he shall save his people from their sins .
then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bid@@ den him , and took unto him his wife :
now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Juda@@ ea in the days of Her@@ od the king , behold , there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem ,
and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scri@@ bes of the people together , he demanded of them where Christ should be born .
and thou Bethlehem , in the land of Jud@@ a , art not the least among the princes of Jud@@ a : for out of thee shall come a Governor , that shall rule my people Israel .
and he sent them to Bethlehem , and said , Go and search dilig@@ ently for the young child ; and when ye have found him , bring me word again , that I may come and worship him also .
when they had heard the king , they departed ; and , lo , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , till it came and stood over where the young child was .
and when they were come into the house , they saw the young child with Mary his mother , and fell down , and wor@@ shipped him : and when they had opened their treasures , they presented unto him gifts ; gold , and frank@@ inc@@ ense , and my@@ rr@@ h .
and being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Her@@ od , they departed into their own country another way .
when he arose , he took the young child and his mother by night , and departed into Egypt :
and was there until the death of Her@@ od : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet , saying , Out of Egypt have I called my son .
in R@@ ama was there a voice heard , lam@@ entation , and we@@ eping , and great mourning , Rach@@ el we@@ eping for her children , and would not be comfor@@ ted , because they are not .
but when Her@@ od was dead , behold , an angel of the Lord appe@@ areth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt ,
saying , A@@ rise , and take the young child and his mother , and go into the land of Israel : for they are dead which sought the young child 's life .
and he arose , and took the young child and his mother , and came into the land of Israel .
and he came and d@@ wel@@ t in a city called Naz@@ areth : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets , He shall be called a Naz@@ aren@@ e .
but when he saw many of the Pharis@@ ees and Sad@@ duc@@ ees come to his baptism , he said unto them , O generation of vi@@ pers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
and think not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
and now also the ax@@ e is laid unto the root of the trees : therefore every tree which br@@ ing@@ eth not forth good fruit is he@@ wn down , and cast into the fire .
I indeed bap@@ ti@@ ze you with water unto repentance : but he that com@@ eth after me is mi@@ gh@@ tier than I , whose shoes I am not worthy to bear : he shall bap@@ ti@@ ze you with the Holy Ghost , and with fire :
whose fan is in his hand , and he will through@@ ly purge his floor , and gather his wheat into the gar@@ ner ; but he will burn up the cha@@ ff with un@@ qu@@ en@@ ch@@ able fire .
and Jesus answering said unto him , Su@@ ff@@ er it to be so now : for thus it becom@@ eth us to fulfil all righteousness . then he suffered him .
and Jesus , when he was baptized , went up strai@@ gh@@ tw@@ ay out of the water : and , lo , the heavens were opened unto him , and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a do@@ ve , and lighting upon him :
and when the temp@@ ter came to him , he said , If thou be the Son of God , command that these stones be made bread .
but he answered and said , It is written , Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proce@@ ed@@ eth out of the mouth of God .
then the devil tak@@ eth him up into the holy city , and sett@@ eth him on a pin@@ n@@ acle of the temple ,
Jesus said unto him , It is written again , Th@@ ou shalt not temp@@ t the Lord thy God .
then sa@@ ith Jesus unto him , Get thee hence , Satan : for it is written , Th@@ ou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve .
and leaving Naz@@ areth , he came and d@@ wel@@ t in Cap@@ ern@@ au@@ m , which is upon the sea coast , in the borders of Z@@ abul@@ on and N@@ eph@@ th@@ ali@@ m :
the people which sat in darkness saw great light ; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sp@@ run@@ g up .
and Jesus went about all Gal@@ ilee , teaching in their syn@@ agogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people .
rejoice , and be exceeding glad : for great is your reward in heaven : for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you .
ye are the salt of the earth : but if the salt have lost his sav@@ our , where@@ with shall it be sal@@ ted ? it is th@@ ence@@ forth good for nothing , but to be cast out , and to be tro@@ dden under foot of men .
think not that I am come to destroy the law , or the prophets : I am not come to destroy , but to fulfil .
wh@@ oso@@ ever therefore shall break one of these least commandments , and shall teach men so , he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven : but wh@@ oso@@ ever shall do and teach them , the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
for I say unto you , That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scri@@ bes and Pharis@@ ees , ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven .
agree with th@@ ine adversary quickly , wh@@ iles thou art in the way with him ; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and thou be cast into prison .
verily I say unto thee , Th@@ ou shalt by no means come out th@@ ence , till thou hast paid the utter@@ most far@@ thing .
and if thy right eye offend thee , pl@@ uck it out , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
and if thy right hand offend thee , cut if off , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
but I say unto you , That wh@@ oso@@ ever shall put away his wife , saving for the cause of for@@ n@@ ication , caus@@ eth her to commit adul@@ tery : and wh@@ oso@@ ever shall marry her that is divorced commit@@ t@@ eth adul@@ tery .
nor by the earth ; for it is his foot@@ stool : neither by Jerusalem ; for it is the city of the great King .
and if any man will sue thee at the law , and take away thy coat , let him have thy clo@@ ke also .
give to him that as@@ ket@@ h thee , and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away .
but I say unto you , Love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them which desp@@ it@@ efully use you , and persec@@ ute you ;
take heed that ye do not your al@@ ms before men , to be seen of them : otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven .
therefore when thou do@@ est th@@ ine al@@ ms , do not sound a trum@@ pet before thee , as the hypo@@ crit@@ es do in the syn@@ agogues and in the streets , that they may have glory of men . verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
and when thou pra@@ y@@ est , thou shalt not be as the hypo@@ crit@@ es are : for they love to pray standing in the syn@@ agogues and in the corners of the streets , that they may be seen of men . verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
but thou , when thou pra@@ y@@ est , enter into thy closet , and when thou hast shut thy door , pray to thy Father which is in secret ; and thy Father which se@@ eth in secret shall reward thee openly .
but when ye pray , use not vain repeti@@ tions , as the he@@ a@@ then do : for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking .
and lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil : for th@@ ine is the kingdom , and the power , and the glory , for ever . A@@ men .
moreover when ye fast , be not , as the hypo@@ crit@@ es , of a sad coun@@ tenance : for they dis@@ figure their faces , that they may appear unto men to fast . verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
that thou appear not unto men to fast , but unto thy Father which is in secret : and thy Father , which se@@ eth in secret , shall reward thee openly .
no man can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and desp@@ ise the other . ye C@@ AN@@ NOT serve God and mamm@@ on .
therefore I say unto you , Take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink ; nor yet for your body , what ye shall put on . is not the life more than meat , and the body than ra@@ iment ?
behold the f@@ ow@@ ls of the air : for they sow not , neither do they reap , nor gather into bar@@ ns ; yet your heavenly Father feed@@ eth them . are ye not much better than they ?
and why take ye thought for ra@@ iment ? consider the l@@ ilies of the field , how they grow ; they to@@ il not , neither do they spin :
therefore take no thought , saying , What shall we eat ? or , What shall we drink ? or , where@@ with@@ al shall we be clo@@ thed ?
take therefore no thought for the mor@@ row : for the mor@@ row shall take thought for the things of itself . sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof .
for with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged : and with what measure ye met@@ e , it shall be measured to you again .
and why be@@ hol@@ dest thou the mo@@ te that is in thy brother 's eye , but consider@@ est not the beam that is in th@@ ine own eye ?
or how wil@@ t thou say to thy brother , Let me pull out the mo@@ te out of th@@ ine eye ; and , behold , a beam is in th@@ ine own eye ?
give not that which is holy unto the dogs , neither cast ye your pear@@ ls before swine , lest they tr@@ ample them under their feet , and turn again and ren@@ d you .
if ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children , how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him ?
because str@@ ait is the gate , and narrow is the way , which lead@@ eth unto life , and few there be that find it .
not every one that sa@@ ith unto me , Lord , Lord , shall enter into the kingdom of heaven ; but he that do@@ eth the will of my Father which is in heaven .
therefore wh@@ oso@@ ever he@@ areth these say@@ ings of mine , and do@@ eth them , I will lik@@ en him unto a wise man , which built his house upon a rock :
and every one that he@@ areth these say@@ ings of mine , and do@@ eth them not , shall be lik@@ ened unto a foolish man , which built his house upon the sand :
and , behold , there came a le@@ per and wor@@ shipped him , saying , Lord , if thou wil@@ t , thou can@@ st make me clean .
and Jesus put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will ; be thou clean . and immediately his le@@ pro@@ sy was cleans@@ ed .
and Jesus sa@@ ith unto him , See thou tell no man ; but go thy way , sh@@ ew thy@@ self to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
and saying , Lord , my servant li@@ eth at home sick of the pal@@ sy , griev@@ ously tor@@ m@@ ented .
for I am a man under authority , having soldiers under me : and I say to this man , Go , and he go@@ eth ; and to another , Come , and he com@@ eth ; and to my servant , Do this , and he do@@ eth it .
when Jesus heard it , he marv@@ elled , and said to them that followed , Ver@@ ily I say unto you , I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel .
but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness : there shall be we@@ eping and gn@@ ashing of teeth .
and Jesus said unto the cent@@ ur@@ ion , Go thy way ; and as thou hast believed , so be it done unto thee . and his servant was healed in the self@@ same hour .
and Jesus sa@@ ith unto him , The fo@@ xes have holes , and the birds of the air have ne@@ sts ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head .
and , behold , there arose a great temp@@ est in the sea , in@@ som@@ uch that the ship was covered with the waves : but he was asleep .
and he sa@@ ith unto them , Why are ye fearful , O ye of little faith ? then he arose , and rebu@@ ked the winds and the sea ; and there was a great calm .
but the men marv@@ elled , saying , What manner of man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey him !
and when he was come to the other side into the country of the Ger@@ g@@ es@@ en@@ es , there met him two possessed with dev@@ ils , coming out of the tom@@ bs , exceeding fierce , so that no man might pass by that way .
and , behold , they cried out , saying , What have we to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of God ? art thou come hi@@ ther to tor@@ ment us before the time ?
and they that kept them fled , and went their ways into the city , and told every thing , and what was be@@ fallen to the possessed of the dev@@ ils .
and , behold , the whole city came out to meet Jesus : and when they saw him , they bes@@ ought him that he would depart out of their co@@ asts .
and , behold , they brought to him a man sick of the pal@@ sy , lying on a bed : and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the pal@@ sy ; Son , be of good che@@ er ; thy sins be forgiven thee .
for whether is easier , to say , Th@@ y sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , A@@ rise , and walk ?
but that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ( then sa@@ ith he to the sick of the pal@@ sy , ) A@@ rise , take up thy bed , and go unto th@@ ine house .
but when the multi@@ tudes saw it , they marv@@ elled , and glori@@ fied God , which had given such power unto men .
and as Jesus passed forth from th@@ ence , he saw a man , named Matthew , sitting at the receipt of custom : and he sa@@ ith unto him , Fol@@ low me . and he arose , and followed him .
but when Jesus heard that , he said unto them , They that be whole need not a physician , but they that are sick .
but go ye and learn what that mean@@ eth , I will have mercy , and not sacrifice : for I am not come to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
and Jesus said unto them , Can the children of the bri@@ dec@@ ham@@ ber mour@@ n , as long as the bri@@ deg@@ room is with them ? but the days will come , when the bri@@ deg@@ room shall be taken from them , and then shall they fast .
no man put@@ t@@ eth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment , for that which is put in to fill it up tak@@ eth from the garment , and the rent is made worse .
while he sp@@ ake these things unto them , behold , there came a certain ruler , and wor@@ shipped him , saying , My daughter is even now dead : but come and lay thy hand upon her , and she shall live .
but Jesus turned him about , and when he saw her , he said , Dau@@ ghter , be of good comfort ; thy faith hath made thee whole . and the woman was made whole from that hour .
and when Jesus came into the ruler 's house , and saw the min@@ st@@ rels and the people making a noise ,
he said unto them , Gi@@ ve place : for the maid is not dead , but sleep@@ eth . and they laughed him to scor@@ n .
and when Jesus departed th@@ ence , two blind men followed him , crying , and saying , Th@@ ou Son of David , have mercy on us .
and when he was come into the house , the blind men came to him : and Jesus sa@@ ith unto them , Beli@@ eve ye that I am able to do this ? they said unto him , Y@@ ea , Lord .
and Jesus went about all the cities and villages , teaching in their syn@@ agogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every sickness and every disease among the people .
but when he saw the multi@@ tudes , he was moved with compassion on them , because they fain@@ ted , and were scattered abroad , as sheep having no shepherd .
and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples , he gave them power against un@@ clean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease .
now the names of the twelve apostles are these ; The first , Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother ; James the son of Ze@@ be@@ dee , and John his brother ;
these twelve Jesus sent forth , and commanded them , saying , Go not into the way of the Genti@@ les , and into any city of the Sam@@ ar@@ it@@ ans enter ye not :
heal the sick , clean@@ se the le@@ pers , raise the dead , cast out dev@@ ils : freely ye have received , freely give .
but when they deliver you up , take no thought how or what ye shall speak : for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak .
but when they persec@@ ute you in this city , flee ye into another : for verily I say unto you , Y@@ e shall not have gone over the cities of Israel , till the Son of man be come .
what I tell you in darkness , that speak ye in light : and what ye hear in the ear , that preach ye upon the hous@@ et@@ ops .
and fear not them which kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul : but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell .
he that fin@@ det@@ h his life shall lose it : and he that lo@@ set@@ h his life for my sake shall find it .
and as they departed , Jesus began to say unto the multi@@ tudes concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness to see ? a re@@ ed shaken with the wind ?
but what went ye out for to see ? a man clo@@ thed in soft ra@@ iment ? behold , they that wear soft clothing are in kings ' houses .
but what went ye out for to see ? a prophet ? ye@@ a , I say unto you , and more than a prophet .
and thou , Cap@@ ern@@ au@@ m , which art exalted unto heaven , shalt be brought down to hell : for if the mighty works , which have been done in thee , had been done in So@@ dom , it would have remained until this day .
all things are delivered unto me of my Father : and no man know@@ eth the Son , but the Father ; neither know@@ eth any man the Father , save the Son , and he to wh@@ om@@ soever the Son will reveal him .
take my y@@ oke upon you , and learn of me ; for I am me@@ ek and low@@ ly in heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls .
but when the Pharis@@ ees saw it , they said unto him , Be@@ hold , thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sab@@ bath day .
how he entered into the house of God , and did eat the sh@@ ew@@ bread , which was not lawful for him to eat , neither for them which were with him , but only for the priests ?
or have ye not read in the law , how that on the sab@@ bath days the priests in the temple prof@@ ane the sab@@ bath , and are bl@@ am@@ eless ?
then sa@@ ith he to the man , St@@ ret@@ ch forth th@@ ine hand . and he stretched it forth ; and it was restored whole , like as the other .
behold my servant , whom I have chosen ; my beloved , in whom my soul is well pleased : I will put my spirit upon him , and he shall sh@@ ew judgment to the Genti@@ les .
a bru@@ ised re@@ ed shall he not break , and smoking fla@@ x shall he not qu@@ en@@ ch , till he send forth judgment unto victory .
then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil , blind , and dumb : and he healed him , in@@ som@@ uch that the blind and dumb both sp@@ ake and saw .
but when the Pharis@@ ees heard it , they said , This fellow do@@ th not cast out dev@@ ils , but by Be@@ el@@ ze@@ bu@@ b the prince of the dev@@ ils .
but if I cast out dev@@ ils by the Spirit of God , then the kingdom of God is come unto you .
or else how can one enter into a strong man 's house , and spoil his goods , except he first bind the strong man ? and then he will spoil his house .
and wh@@ oso@@ ever spe@@ ak@@ eth a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but wh@@ oso@@ ever spe@@ ak@@ eth against the Holy Ghost , it shall not be forgiven him , neither in this world , neither in the world to come .
either make the tree good , and his fruit good ; or else make the tree corrupt , and his fruit corrupt : for the tree is known by his fruit .
O generation of vi@@ pers , how can ye , being evil , speak good things ? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth spe@@ ak@@ eth .
but I say unto you , That every idle word that men shall speak , they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment .
for by thy words thou shalt be justified , and by thy words thou shalt be condemned .
but he answered and said unto them , An evil and adul@@ ter@@ ous generation see@@ ket@@ h after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given to it , but the sign of the prophet Jon@@ as :
for as Jon@@ as was three days and three nights in the whale 's belly ; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
the men of N@@ inev@@ eh shall rise in judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : because they rep@@ ented at the preaching of Jon@@ as ; and , behold , a greater than Jon@@ as is here .
then he sa@@ ith , I will return into my house from wh@@ ence I came out ; and when he is come , he fin@@ det@@ h it empty , swept , and gar@@ nished .
then go@@ eth he , and tak@@ eth with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter in and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first . even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation .
but he answered and said unto him that told him , Who is my mother ? and who are my brethren ?
for wh@@ oso@@ ever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven , the same is my brother , and sister , and mother .
and great multi@@ tudes were gathered together unto him , so that he went into a ship , and sat ; and the whole multitude stood on the shore .
and he sp@@ ake many things unto them in par@@ ables , saying , Be@@ hold , a s@@ ower went forth to sow ;
some fell upon st@@ ony places , where they had not much earth : and forth@@ with they sp@@ run@@ g up , because they had no deep@@ ness of earth :
he answered and said unto them , Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it is not given .
and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Es@@ ai@@ as , which sa@@ ith , By hearing ye shall hear , and shall not understand ; and seeing ye shall see , and shall not perceive :
for verily I say unto you , That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
but he that received the seed into st@@ ony places , the same is he that he@@ areth the word , and an@@ on with joy recei@@ v@@ eth it ;
he also that received seed among the thor@@ ns is he that he@@ areth the word ; and the care of this world , and the dece@@ it@@ fulness of riches , cho@@ ke the word , and he becom@@ eth un@@ fruitful .
but he that received seed into the good ground is he that he@@ areth the word , and understand@@ eth it ; which also be@@ areth fruit , and br@@ ing@@ eth forth , some an hundre@@ d@@ fold , some sixty , some thirty .
another parable put he forth unto them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is lik@@ ened unto a man which s@@ owed good seed in his field :
let both grow together until the harvest : and in the time of harvest I will say to the re@@ apers , G@@ ather ye together first the tares , and bind them in bun@@ dles to burn them : but gather the wheat into my bar@@ n .
which indeed is the least of all seeds : but when it is grown , it is the greatest among herbs , and becom@@ eth a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof .
another parable sp@@ ake he unto them ; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leav@@ en , which a woman took , and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leav@@ ened .
then Jesus sent the multitude away , and went into the house : and his disciples came unto him , saying , Dec@@ l@@ are unto us the parable of the tares of the field .
the enemy that s@@ owed them is the devil ; the harvest is the end of the world ; and the re@@ apers are the angels .
then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father . who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field ; the which when a man hath found , he hi@@ det@@ h , and for joy thereof go@@ eth and sel@@ let@@ h all that he hath , and buy@@ eth that field .
which , when it was full , they drew to shore , and sat down , and gathered the good into vessels , but cast the bad away .
and when he was come into his own country , he taught them in their synagogue , in@@ som@@ uch that they were astonished , and said , wh@@ ence hath this man this wisdom , and these mighty works ?
and they were offended in him . but Jesus said unto them , A prophet is not without honour , save in his own country , and in his own house .
and said unto his servants , This is John the Baptist ; he is risen from the dead ; and therefore mighty works do sh@@ ew forth themselves in him .
for Her@@ od had laid hold on John , and bound him , and put him in prison for Her@@ odi@@ as ' sake , his brother Philip 's wife .
and when he would have put him to death , he feared the multitude , because they counted him as a prophet .
when Jesus heard of it , he departed th@@ ence by ship into a desert place apart : and when the people had heard thereof , they followed him on foot out of the cities .
and Jesus went forth , and saw a great multitude , and was moved with compassion toward them , and he healed their sick .
and when it was evening , his disciples came to him , saying , This is a desert place , and the time is now past ; send the multitude away , that they may go into the villages , and buy themselves vic@@ tu@@ als .
and strai@@ gh@@ tw@@ ay Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship , and to go before him unto the other side , while he sent the multi@@ tudes away .
and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , It is a spirit ; and they cried out for fear .
and he said , Come . and when Peter was come down out of the ship , he walked on the water , to go to Jesus .
but when he saw the wind bo@@ ist@@ erous , he was afraid ; and beginning to sink , he cried , saying , Lord , save me .
then they that were in the ship came and wor@@ shipped him , saying , Of a truth thou art the Son of God .
and bes@@ ought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment : and as many as touched were made perfectly whole .
for God commanded , saying , Hon@@ our thy father and mother : and , He that cur@@ set@@ h father or mother , let him die the death .
but ye say , Wh@@ oso@@ ever shall say to his father or his mother , It is a gift , by whatsoever thou mi@@ gh@@ test be prof@@ ited by me ;
and honour not his father or his mother , he shall be free . thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition .
let them alone : they be blind leaders of the blind . and if the blind lead the blind , both shall fall into the ditch .
but he answered and said , I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
then Jesus answered and said unto her , O woman , great is thy faith : be it unto thee even as thou wil@@ t . and her daughter was made whole from that very hour .
and great multi@@ tudes came unto him , having with them those that were lame , blind , dumb , ma@@ im@@ ed , and many others , and cast them down at Jesus ' feet ; and he healed them :
then Jesus called his disciples unto him , and said , I have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me now three days , and have nothing to eat : and I will not send them away fasting , lest they faint in the way .
and his disciples say unto him , wh@@ ence should we have so much bread in the wilderness , as to fill so great a multitude ?
he answered and said unto them , When it is evening , ye say , It will be fair weather : for the sky is red .
a wicked and adul@@ ter@@ ous generation see@@ ket@@ h after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given unto it , but the sign of the prophet Jon@@ as . and he left them , and departed .
then understood they how that he b@@ ade them not beware of the leav@@ en of bread , but of the doctrine of the Pharis@@ ees and of the Sad@@ duc@@ ees .
when Jesus came into the co@@ asts of Caes@@ area Philipp@@ i , he asked his disciples , saying , Who@@ m do men say that I the Son of man am ?
and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loos@@ ed in heaven .
from that time forth began Jesus to sh@@ ew unto his disciples , how that he must go unto Jerusalem , and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scri@@ bes , and be killed , and be raised again the third day .
but he turned , and said unto Peter , Get thee behind me , Satan : thou art an offence unto me : for thou sav@@ ou@@ rest not the things that be of God , but those that be of men .
for what is a man prof@@ ited , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
then answered Peter , and said unto Jesus , Lord , it is good for us to be here : if thou wil@@ t , let us make here three tab@@ ern@@ acles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Eli@@ as .
while he yet sp@@ ake , behold , a bright cloud over@@ shad@@ owed them : and behold a voice out of the cloud , which said , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased ; hear ye him .
but I say unto you , That Eli@@ as is come already , and they knew him not , but have done unto him whatsoever they listed . likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them .
and when they were come to the multitude , there came to him a certain man , kne@@ eling down to him , and saying ,
and while they ab@@ ode in Gal@@ ilee , Jesus said unto them , The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men :
and they shall kill him , and the third day he shall be raised again . and they were exceeding sorry .
at the same time came the disciples unto Jesus , saying , Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven ?
and said , Ver@@ ily I say unto you , Exc@@ ept ye be converted , and become as little children , ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven .
but wh@@ os@@ o shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me , it were better for him that a mil@@ l@@ stone were han@@ ged about his neck , and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea .
and if th@@ ine eye offend thee , pl@@ uck it out , and cast it from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire .
take heed that ye desp@@ ise not one of these little ones ; for I say unto you , That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven .
how think ye ? if a man have an hundred sheep , and one of them be gone astr@@ ay , do@@ th he not leave the ninety and nine , and go@@ eth into the mountains , and see@@ ket@@ h that which is gone astr@@ ay ?
and if so be that he find it , verily I say unto you , he rejo@@ ic@@ eth more of that sheep , than of the ninety and nine which went not astr@@ ay .
moreover if thy brother shall t@@ resp@@ ass against thee , go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone : if he shall hear thee , thou hast gained thy brother .
but if he will not hear thee , then take with thee one or two more , that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established .
and if he shall neglect to hear them , tell it unto the church : but if he neglect to hear the church , let him be unto thee as an he@@ a@@ then man and a public@@ an .
again I say unto you , That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask , it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven .
then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion , and loos@@ ed him , and for@@ gave him the debt .
but the same servant went out , and found one of his fel@@ low@@ servants , which owed him an hundred p@@ ence : and he laid hands on him , and took him by the throat , saying , Pay me that thou ow@@ est .
so when his fel@@ low@@ servants saw what was done , they were very sorry , and came and told unto their lord all that was done .
then his lord , after that he had called him , said unto him , O thou wicked servant , I for@@ gave thee all that debt , because thou desi@@ red@@ st me :
and his lord was w@@ ro@@ th , and delivered him to the tor@@ mentors , till he should pay all that was due unto him .
and it came to pass , that when Jesus had finished these say@@ ings , he departed from Gal@@ ilee , and came into the co@@ asts of Juda@@ ea beyond Jordan ;
the Pharis@@ ees also came unto him , tempting him , and saying unto him , Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause ?
and he answered and said unto them , Have ye not read , that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female ,
and said , For this cause shall a man leave father and mother , and shall cle@@ ave to his wife : and they tw@@ ain shall be one flesh ?
they say unto him , Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divor@@ cement , and to put her away ?
he sa@@ ith unto them , Moses because of the hard@@ ness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives : but from the beginning it was not so .
and I say unto you , Wh@@ oso@@ ever shall put away his wife , except it be for for@@ n@@ ication , and shall marry another , commit@@ t@@ eth adul@@ tery : and wh@@ os@@ o marri@@ eth her which is put away do@@ th commit adul@@ tery .
his disciples say unto him , If the case of the man be so with his wife , it is not good to marry .
but he said unto them , All men C@@ AN@@ NOT receive this saying , save they to whom it is given .
for there are some e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , which were so born from their mother 's womb : and there are some e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , which were made e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s of men : and there be e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s , which have made themselves e@@ un@@ u@@ ch@@ s for the kingdom of heaven 's sake . he that is able to receive it , let him receive it .
then were there brought unto him little children , that he should put his hands on them , and pray : and the disciples rebu@@ ked them .
but Jesus said , Su@@ ff@@ er little children , and forbid them not , to come unto me : for of such is the kingdom of heaven .
the young man sa@@ ith unto him , All these things have I kept from my youth up : what lack I yet ?
Jesus said unto him , If thou wil@@ t be perfect , go and sell that thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come and follow me .
then said Jesus unto his disciples , Ver@@ ily I say unto you , That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven .
but Jesus be@@ held them , and said unto them , With men this is impossible ; but with God all things are possible .
they say unto him , Because no man hath hired us . he sa@@ ith unto them , Go ye also into the viney@@ ard ; and whatsoever is right , that shall ye receive .
so when even was come , the lord of the viney@@ ard sa@@ ith unto his ste@@ ward , Call the lab@@ our@@ ers , and give them their hire , beginning from the last unto the first .
but when the first came , they supposed that they should have received more ; and they likewise received every man a penny .
saying , These last have wrought but one hour , and thou hast made them equal unto us , which have borne the burden and heat of the day .
behold , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scri@@ bes , and they shall condemn him to death ,
and he said unto her , What wil@@ t thou ? she sa@@ ith unto him , Grant that these my two sons may sit , the one on thy right hand , and the other on the left , in thy kingdom .
but Jesus answered and said , Y@@ e know not what ye ask . are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of , and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? they say unto him , We are able .
but Jesus called them unto him , and said , Y@@ e know that the princes of the Genti@@ les exercise dom@@ inion over them , and they that are great exercise authority upon them .
and , behold , two blind men sitting by the way side , when they heard that Jesus passed by , cried out , saying , Have mercy on us , O Lord , thou Son of David .
and Jesus stood still , and called them , and said , What will ye that I shall do unto you ?
and when they drew ni@@ gh unto Jerusalem , and were come to Beth@@ p@@ ha@@ ge , unto the mount of O@@ lives , then sent Jesus two disciples ,
and if any man say ought unto you , ye shall say , The Lord hath need of them ; and strai@@ gh@@ tw@@ ay he will send them .
tell ye the daughter of Si@@ on , Be@@ hold , thy King com@@ eth unto thee , me@@ ek , and sitting upon an ass , and a col@@ t the fo@@ al of an ass .
and said unto them , It is written , My house shall be called the house of prayer ; but ye have made it a den of thieves .
and when the chief priests and scri@@ bes saw the wonderful things that he did , and the children crying in the temple , and saying , Hos@@ anna to the Son of David ; they were sore dis@@ pleased ,
and when he saw a fi@@ g tree in the way , he came to it , and found nothing there@@ on , but leaves only , and said unto it , Let no fruit grow on thee h@@ ence@@ forward for ever . and presently the fi@@ g tree with@@ ered away .
and when the disciples saw it , they marv@@ elled , saying , How soon is the fi@@ g tree with@@ ered away !
and when he was come into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching , and said , By what authority do@@ est thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority ?
and Jesus answered and said unto them , I also will ask you one thing , which if ye tell me , I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things .
the baptism of John , wh@@ ence was it ? from heaven , or of men ? and they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say unto us , Why did ye not then believe him ?
whether of them tw@@ ain did the will of his father ? they say unto him , The first . Jesus sa@@ ith unto them , Ver@@ ily I say unto you , That the public@@ ans and the har@@ lots go into the kingdom of God before you .
for John came unto you in the way of righteousness , and ye believed him not : but the public@@ ans and the har@@ lots believed him : and ye , when ye had seen it , rep@@ ented not afterward , that ye might believe him .
hear another parable : there was a certain house@@ holder , which planted a viney@@ ard , and hed@@ ged it round about , and di@@ gged a win@@ ep@@ ress in it , and built a tower , and let it out to Hus@@ band@@ men , and went into a far country :
but when the Hus@@ band@@ men saw the son , they said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and let us seize on his inheritance .
they say unto him , He will miser@@ ably destroy those wicked men , and will let out his viney@@ ard unto other Hus@@ band@@ men , which shall render him the fruits in their seasons .
Jesus sa@@ ith unto them , Did ye never read in the scriptures , The stone which the builders rejected , the same is become the head of the corner : this is the Lord 's doing , and it is marv@@ ell@@ ous in our eyes ?
therefore say I unto you , The kingdom of God shall be taken from you , and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof .
again , he sent forth other servants , saying , Tell them which are bid@@ den , Be@@ hold , I have prepared my dinner : my ox@@ en and my fat@@ lings are killed , and all things are ready : come unto the marriage .
but when the king heard thereof , he was w@@ ro@@ th : and he sent forth his armies , and destroyed those murderers , and burned up their city .
so those servants went out into the highways , and gathered together all as many as they found , both bad and good : and the wedding was furnished with guests .
and when the king came in to see the guests , he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment :
then said the king to the servants , B@@ ind him hand and foot , and take him away , and cast him into outer darkness ; there shall be we@@ eping and gn@@ ashing of teeth .
now there were with us seven brethren : and the first , when he had married a wife , deceased , and , having no issue , left his wife unto his brother :
Jesus answered and said unto them , Y@@ e do er@@ r , not knowing the scriptures , nor the power of God .
then one of them , which was a lawyer , asked him a question , tempting him , and saying ,
Jesus said unto him , Th@@ ou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind .
and no man was able to answer him a word , neither Dur@@ st any man from that day forth ask him any more questions .
but all their works they do for to be seen of men : they make broad their ph@@ yl@@ ac@@ ter@@ ies , and enlarge the borders of their garments ,
w@@ oe unto you , scri@@ bes and Pharis@@ ees , hypo@@ crit@@ es ! for ye dev@@ our wid@@ ows ' houses , and for a pret@@ ence make long prayer : therefore ye shall receive the greater dam@@ nation .
w@@ oe unto you , ye blind guides , which say , Wh@@ oso@@ ever shall swear by the temple , it is nothing ; but wh@@ oso@@ ever shall swear by the gold of the temple , he is a debtor !
w@@ oe unto you , scri@@ bes and Pharis@@ ees , hypo@@ crit@@ es ! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the plat@@ ter , but within they are full of extortion and excess .
thou blind Pharis@@ ee , clean@@ se first that which is within the cup and plat@@ ter , that the outside of them may be clean also .
w@@ oe unto you , scri@@ bes and Pharis@@ ees , hypo@@ crit@@ es ! for ye are like unto wh@@ ited se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res , which indeed appear beautiful outward , but are within full of dead men 's bones , and of all un@@ clean@@ ness .
and say , If we had been in the days of our fathers , we would not have been part@@ akers with them in the blood of the prophets .
W@@ herefore , behold , I send unto you prophets , and wise men , and scri@@ bes : and some of them ye shall kill and cruci@@ fy ; and some of them shall ye scourge in your syn@@ agogues , and persec@@ ute them from city to city :
that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth , from the blood of righteous A@@ bel unto the blood of Z@@ ach@@ ari@@ as son of Bar@@ achi@@ as , whom ye sle@@ w between the temple and the altar .
O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , thou that kill@@ est the prophets , and st@@ on@@ est them which are sent unto thee , how often would I have gathered thy children together , even as a hen gather@@ eth her chickens under her wings , and ye would not !
and Jesus went out , and departed from the temple : and his disciples came to him for to sh@@ ew him the buildings of the temple .
and as he sat upon the mount of O@@ lives , the disciples came unto him privately , saying , Tell us , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign of thy coming , and of the end of the world ?
and ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars : see that ye be not troubled : for all these things must come to pass , but the end is not yet .
then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted , and shall kill you : and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name 's sake .
and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations ; and then shall the end come .
when ye therefore shall see the ab@@ om@@ ination of des@@ ol@@ ation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , stand in the holy place , ( wh@@ os@@ o read@@ eth , let him understand : )
for as the lightning com@@ eth out of the east , and sh@@ in@@ eth even unto the west ; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
immediately after the tribu@@ lation of those days shall the sun be dark@@ ened , and the moon shall not give her light , and the stars shall fall from heaven , and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken :
now learn a parable of the fi@@ g tree ; When his branch is yet tender , and put@@ t@@ eth forth leaves , ye know that summer is ni@@ gh :
for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking , mar@@ rying and giving in marriage , until the day that No@@ e entered into the ark ,
but know this , that if the good@@ man of the house had known in what watch the thief would come , he would have watched , and would not have suffered his house to be broken up .
then shall the kingdom of heaven be lik@@ ened unto ten vir@@ gins , which took their lamps , and went forth to meet the bri@@ deg@@ room .
and at midnight there was a cry made , Be@@ hold , the bri@@ deg@@ room com@@ eth ; go ye out to meet him .
but the wise answered , saying , Not so ; lest there be not enough for us and you : but go ye rather to them that sell , and buy for yourselves .
and while they went to buy , the bri@@ deg@@ room came ; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage : and the door was shut .
then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same , and made them other five talents .
and so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents , saying , Lord , thou deliver@@ ed@@ st unto me five talents : behold , I have gained beside them five talents more .
his lord said unto him , Well done , thou good and faithful servant : thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will make thee ruler over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
his lord said unto him , Well done , good and faithful servant ; thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will make thee ruler over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
then he which had received the one talent came and said , Lord , I knew thee that thou art an hard man , re@@ aping where thou hast not s@@ own , and gathering where thou hast not str@@ aw@@ ed :
and I was afraid , and went and hid thy talent in the earth : lo , there thou hast that is th@@ ine .
thou ough@@ test therefore to have put my money to the ex@@ chang@@ ers , and then at my coming I should have received mine own with us@@ ury .
and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness : there shall be we@@ eping and gn@@ ashing of teeth .
when the Son of man shall come in his glory , and all the holy angels with him , then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory :
and before him shall be gathered all nations : and he shall separate them one from another , as a shepherd divi@@ det@@ h his sheep from the goats :
then shall the King say unto them on his right hand , Come , ye blessed of my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world :
for I was an hun@@ g@@ red , and ye gave me meat : I was thir@@ sty , and ye gave me drink : I was a stranger , and ye took me in :
and the King shall answer and say unto them , Ver@@ ily I say unto you , in@@ as@@ much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren , ye have done it unto me .
I was a stranger , and ye took me not in : naked , and ye clo@@ thed me not : sick , and in prison , and ye visited me not .
then shall he answer them , saying , Ver@@ ily I say unto you , in@@ as@@ much as ye did it not to one of the least of these , ye did it not to me .
ye know that after two days is the feast of the pas@@ sover , and the Son of man is betrayed to be cruci@@ fied .
but when his disciples saw it , they had indignation , saying , To what purpose is this waste ?
when Jesus understood it , he said unto them , Why trouble ye the woman ? for she hath wrought a good work upon me .
verily I say unto you , W@@ her@@ eso@@ ever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world , there shall also this , that this woman hath done , be told for a memorial of her .
and said unto them , What will ye give me , and I will deliver him unto you ? and they coven@@ anted with him for thirty pieces of silver .
and he said , Go into the city to such a man , and say unto him , The Master sa@@ ith , My time is at hand ; I will keep the pas@@ sover at thy house with my disciples .
and he answered and said , He that di@@ pp@@ eth his hand with me in the dish , the same shall betray me .
the Son of man go@@ eth as it is written of him : but w@@ oe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed ! it had been good for that man if he had not been born .
and as they were eating , Jesus took bread , and blessed it , and brake it , and gave it to the disciples , and said , Take , eat ; this is my body .
and he took the cup , and gave thanks , and gave it to them , saying , Dr@@ ink ye all of it ;
for this is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many for the rem@@ is@@ sion of sins .
Peter answered and said unto him , Th@@ ough all men shall be offended because of thee , yet will I never be offended .
and he took with him Peter and the two sons of Ze@@ be@@ dee , and began to be sor@@ row@@ ful and very heavy .
then sa@@ ith he unto them , My soul is exceeding sor@@ row@@ ful , even unto death : tar@@ ry ye here , and watch with me .
and he went a little further , and fell on his face , and prayed , saying , O my Father , if it be possible , let this cup pass from me : nevertheless not as I will , but as thou wil@@ t .
watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak .
then com@@ eth he to his disciples , and sa@@ ith unto them , S@@ leep on now , and take your rest : behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
and while he yet sp@@ ake , lo , Jud@@ as , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multitude with s@@ words and st@@ aves , from the chief priests and elders of the people .
now he that betrayed him gave them a sign , saying , wh@@ om@@ soever I shall kiss , that same is he : hold him fast .
and , behold , one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck a servant of the high priest 's , and smo@@ te off his ear .
then said Jesus unto him , P@@ ut up again thy sword into his place : for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword .
in that same hour said Jesus to the multi@@ tudes , Are ye come out as against a thief with s@@ words and st@@ aves for to take me ? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple , and ye laid no hold on me .
but all this was done , that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . then all the disciples for@@ s@@ ook him , and fled .
and said , This fellow said , I am able to destroy the temple of God , and to build it in three days .
then the high priest rent his clothes , saying , He hath spoken bl@@ asph@@ emy ; what further need have we of witnesses ? behold , now ye have heard his bl@@ asph@@ emy .
and when he was gone out into the por@@ ch , another maid saw him , and said unto them that were there , This fellow was also with Jesus of Naz@@ areth .
and after a while came unto him they that stood by , and said to Peter , Su@@ rely thou also art one of them ; for thy speech be@@ w@@ ra@@ y@@ eth thee .
and Peter remembered the word of Jesus , which said unto him , Before the cock c@@ row , thou shalt deny me thr@@ ice . and he went out , and we@@ pt bit@@ terly .
when the morning was come , all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death :
then Jud@@ as , which had betrayed him , when he saw that he was condemned , rep@@ ented himself , and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
saying , I have sin@@ ned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood . and they said , What is that to us ? see thou to that .
and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple , and departed , and went and han@@ ged himself .
and Jesus stood before the governor : and the governor asked him , saying , Art thou the King of the Jews ? and Jesus said unto him , Th@@ ou say@@ est .
when he was set down on the judgment seat , his wife sent unto him , saying , Have thou nothing to do with that just man : for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him .
but the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Bar@@ ab@@ bas , and destroy Jesus .
the governor answered and said unto them , Whe@@ ther of the tw@@ ain will ye that I release unto you ? they said , Bar@@ ab@@ bas .
Pil@@ ate sa@@ ith unto them , What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ ? they all say unto him , Let him be cruci@@ fied .
and the governor said , Why , what evil hath he done ? but they cried out the more , saying , Let him be cruci@@ fied .
when Pil@@ ate saw that he could prevail nothing , but that rather a tum@@ ult was made , he took water , and washed his hands before the multitude , saying , I am innocent of the blood of this just person : see ye to it .
and after that they had mo@@ cked him , they took the robe off from him , and put his own ra@@ iment on him , and led him away to cruci@@ fy him .
and when they were come unto a place called Gol@@ go@@ tha , that is to say , a place of a skull ,
and saying , Th@@ ou that destro@@ y@@ est the temple , and buil@@ dest it in three days , save thy@@ self . if thou be the Son of God , come down from the cross .
he saved others ; himself he C@@ AN@@ NOT save . if he be the King of Israel , let him now come down from the cross , and we will believe him .
he trusted in God ; let him deliver him now , if he will have him : for he said , I am the Son of God .
and about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , El@@ i , El@@ i , l@@ ama sab@@ ach@@ than@@ i ? that is to say , My God , my God , why hast thou for@@ s@@ aken me ?
some of them that stood there , when they heard that , said , This man call@@ eth for Eli@@ as .
and strai@@ gh@@ tw@@ ay one of them ran , and took a sp@@ un@@ ge , and filled it with vin@@ eg@@ ar , and put it on a re@@ ed , and gave him to drink .
now when the cent@@ ur@@ ion , and they that were with him , watching Jesus , saw the earthquake , and those things that were done , they feared greatly , saying , Tru@@ ly this was the Son of God .
when the even was come , there came a rich man of Ari@@ ma@@ th@@ a@@ ea , named Joseph , who also himself was Jesus ' disciple :
and laid it in his own new tomb , which he had he@@ wn out in the rock : and he rolled a great stone to the door of the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , and departed .
command therefore that the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re be made sure until the third day , lest his disciples come by night , and steal him away , and say unto the people , He is risen from the dead : so the last error shall be worse than the first .
and , behold , there was a great earthquake : for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven , and came and rolled back the stone from the door , and sat upon it .
and go quickly , and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead ; and , behold , he go@@ eth before you into Gal@@ ilee ; there shall ye see him : lo , I have told you .
now when they were going , behold , some of the watch came into the city , and sh@@ ew@@ ed unto the chief priests all the things that were done .
and when they were assembled with the elders , and had taken counsel , they gave large money unto the soldiers ,
and Jesus came and sp@@ ake unto them , saying , All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth .
teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you : and , lo , I am with you al@@ way , even unto the end of the world . A@@ men .
and there went out unto him all the land of Juda@@ ea , and they of Jerusalem , and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan , conf@@ essing their sins .
and John was clo@@ thed with cam@@ el 's hair , and with a gir@@ dle of a skin about his lo@@ ins ; and he did eat lo@@ cu@@ sts and wild honey ;
and preached , saying , There com@@ eth one mi@@ gh@@ tier than I after me , the lat@@ ch@@ et of whose shoes I am not worthy to st@@ oop down and un@@ loose .
and it came to pass in those days , that Jesus came from Naz@@ areth of Gal@@ ilee , and was baptized of John in Jordan .
and there came a voice from heaven , saying , Th@@ ou art my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased .
and he was there in the wilderness forty days , tempted of Satan ; and was with the wild beasts ; and the angels minist@@ ered unto him .
now after that John was put in prison , Jesus came into Gal@@ ilee , preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God ,
and saying , The time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of God is at hand : repent ye , and believe the gospel .
and when the un@@ clean spirit had torn him , and cried with a loud voice , he came out of him .
and they were all amazed , in@@ som@@ uch that they questioned among themselves , saying , What thing is this ? what new doctrine is this ? for with authority comman@@ det@@ h he even the un@@ clean spirits , and they do obey him .
and when they had found him , they said unto him , All men seek for thee .
and there came a le@@ per to him , bes@@ e@@ ech@@ ing him , and kne@@ eling down to him , and saying unto him , If thou wil@@ t , thou can@@ st make me clean .
and Jesus , moved with compassion , put forth his hand , and touched him , and sa@@ ith unto him , I will ; be thou clean .
and sa@@ ith unto him , See thou say nothing to any man : but go thy way , sh@@ ew thy@@ self to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
but he went out , and began to publish it much , and to bla@@ ze abroad the matter , in@@ som@@ uch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city , but was without in desert places : and they came to him from every quarter .
and when they could not come ni@@ gh unto him for the press , they uncovered the roof where he was : and when they had broken it up , they let down the bed where@@ in the sick of the pal@@ sy lay .
when Jesus saw their faith , he said unto the sick of the pal@@ sy , Son , thy sins be forgiven thee .
and immediately he arose , took up the bed , and went forth before them all ; in@@ som@@ uch that they were all amazed , and glori@@ fied God , saying , We never saw it on this fashion .
and as he passed by , he saw Lev@@ i the son of Al@@ p@@ ha@@ eus sitting at the receipt of custom , and said unto him , Fol@@ low me . and he arose and followed him .
and it came to pass , that , as Jesus sat at meat in his house , many public@@ ans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples : for there were many , and they followed him .
when Jesus heard it , he sa@@ ith unto them , They that are whole have no need of the physician , but they that are sick : I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
and Jesus said unto them , Can the children of the bri@@ dec@@ ham@@ ber fast , while the bri@@ deg@@ room is with them ? as long as they have the bri@@ deg@@ room with them , they C@@ AN@@ NOT fast .
no man also se@@ w@@ eth a piece of new cloth on an old garment : else the new piece that filled it up tak@@ eth away from the old , and the rent is made worse .
and no man put@@ t@@ eth new wine into old bottles : else the new wine do@@ th burst the bottles , and the wine is spilled , and the bottles will be mar@@ red : but new wine must be put into new bottles .
and he said unto them , Have ye never read what David did , when he had need , and was an hun@@ g@@ red , he , and they that were with him ?
how he went into the house of God in the days of A@@ bi@@ ath@@ ar the high priest , and did eat the sh@@ ew@@ bread , which is not lawful to eat but for the priests , and gave also to them which were with him ?
and he entered again into the synagogue ; and there was a man there which had a with@@ ered hand .
and he sa@@ ith unto them , Is it lawful to do good on the sab@@ bath days , or to do evil ? to save life , or to kill ? but they held their peace .
and when he had looked round about on them with anger , being griev@@ ed for the hard@@ ness of their hearts , he sa@@ ith unto the man , St@@ ret@@ ch forth th@@ ine hand . and he stretched it out : and his hand was restored whole as the other .
and from Jerusalem , and from I@@ dum@@ a@@ ea , and from beyond Jordan ; and they about Ty@@ re and Sid@@ on , a great multitude , when they had heard what great things he did , came unto him .
and he sp@@ ake to his disciples , that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude , lest they should thr@@ ong him .
for he had healed many ; in@@ som@@ uch that they pressed upon him for to touch him , as many as had pl@@ agues .
and un@@ clean spirits , when they saw him , fell down before him , and cried , saying , Th@@ ou art the Son of God .
and James the son of Ze@@ be@@ dee , and John the brother of James ; and he sur@@ named them Bo@@ an@@ er@@ ges , which is , The sons of thunder :
and when his friends heard of it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said , He is beside himself .
no man can enter into a strong man 's house , and spoil his goods , except he will first bind the strong man ; and then he will spoil his house .
verily I say unto you , All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men , and bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ies where@@ with soever they shall bl@@ asph@@ eme :
and he looked round about on them which sat about him , and said , Be@@ hold my mother and my brethren !
and he began again to teach by the sea side : and there was gathered unto him a great multitude , so that he entered into a ship , and sat in the sea ; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land .
and it came to pass , as he s@@ owed , some fell by the way side , and the f@@ ow@@ ls of the air came and dev@@ oured it up .
and some fell on st@@ ony ground , where it had not much earth ; and immediately it sprang up , because it had no depth of earth :
and other fell on good ground , and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased ; and brought forth , some thirty , and some sixty , and some an hundred .
that seeing they may see , and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest at any time they should be converted , and their sins should be forgiven them .
and these are they by the way side , where the word is s@@ own ; but when they have heard , Satan com@@ eth immediately , and tak@@ eth away the word that was s@@ own in their hearts .
and these are they likewise which are s@@ own on st@@ ony ground ; who , when they have heard the word , immediately receive it with gl@@ ad@@ ness ;
and have no root in themselves , and so endure but for a time : afterward , when afflic@@ tion or persecution ar@@ is@@ eth for the word 's sake , immediately they are offended .
and these are they which are s@@ own on good ground ; such as hear the word , and receive it , and bring forth fruit , some thir@@ ty@@ fold , some sixty , and some an hundred .
and he said unto them , Take heed what ye hear : with what measure ye met@@ e , it shall be measured to you : and unto you that hear shall more be given .
and he said , So is the kingdom of God , as if a man should cast seed into the ground ;
but when it is s@@ own , it grow@@ eth up , and becom@@ eth greater than all herbs , and shoo@@ t@@ eth out great branches ; so that the f@@ ow@@ ls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it .
and when they had sent away the multitude , they took him even as he was in the ship . and there were also with him other little ships .
and there arose a great storm of wind , and the waves beat into the ship , so that it was now full .
and he was in the hinder part of the ship , asleep on a pillow : and they awake him , and say unto him , Master , ca@@ rest thou not that we perish ?
and he arose , and rebu@@ ked the wind , and said unto the sea , Peace , be still . and the wind ceased , and there was a great calm .
and he said unto them , Why are ye so fearful ? how is it that ye have no faith ?
and they feared exceedingly , and said one to another , What manner of man is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ?
and when he was come out of the ship , immediately there met him out of the tom@@ bs a man with an un@@ clean spirit ,
who had his dwelling among the tom@@ bs ; and no man could bind him , no , not with chains :
because that he had been often bound with fet@@ ters and chains , and the chains had been pl@@ ucked as@@ under by him , and the fet@@ ters broken in pieces : neither could any man tame him .
and always , night and day , he was in the mountains , and in the tom@@ bs , crying , and cutting himself with stones .
and cried with a loud voice , and said , What have I to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of the most high God ? I ad@@ j@@ ure thee by God , that thou tor@@ ment me not .
and forth@@ with Jesus gave them leave . and the un@@ clean spirits went out , and entered into the swine : and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea , ( they were about two thousand ; ) and were cho@@ ked in the sea .
and they come to Jesus , and see him that was possessed with the devil , and had the legi@@ on , sitting , and clo@@ thed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
How@@ be@@ it Jesus suffered him not , but sa@@ ith unto him , Go home to thy friends , and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee , and hath had compassion on thee .
and he departed , and began to publish in Dec@@ apolis how great things Jesus had done for him : and all men did mar@@ vel .
and when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side , much people gathered unto him : and he was ni@@ gh unto the sea .
and , behold , there com@@ eth one of the rulers of the synagogue , J@@ air@@ us by name ; and when he saw him , he fell at his feet ,
while he yet sp@@ ake , there came from the ruler of the synagogue 's house certain which said , Th@@ y daughter is dead : why troubl@@ est thou the Master any further ?
as soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken , he sa@@ ith unto the ruler of the synagogue , Be not afraid , only believe .
and they laughed him to scor@@ n . but when he had put them all out , he tak@@ eth the father and the mother of the dam@@ sel , and them that were with him , and enter@@ eth in where the dam@@ sel was lying .
and strai@@ gh@@ tw@@ ay the dam@@ sel arose , and walked ; for she was of the age of twelve years . and they were astonished with a great aston@@ ishment .
is not this the carp@@ enter , the son of Mary , the brother of James , and Jos@@ es , and of Jud@@ a , and Simon ? and are not his sisters here with us ? and they were offended at him .
but Jesus said unto them , A prophet is not without honour , but in his own country , and among his own kin , and in his own house .
and he could there do no mighty work , save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk , and healed them .
and he called unto him the twelve , and began to send them forth by two and two ; and gave them power over un@@ clean spirits ;
and king Her@@ od heard of him ; ( for his name was spread abroad : ) and he said , That John the Baptist was risen from the dead , and therefore mighty works do sh@@ ew forth themselves in him .
others said , That it is Eli@@ as . and others said , That it is a prophet , or as one of the prophets .
for Her@@ od himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John , and bound him in prison for Her@@ odi@@ as ' sake , his brother Philip 's wife : for he had married her .
for Her@@ od feared John , knowing that he was a just man and an holy , and observed him ; and when he heard him , he did many things , and heard him gladly .
and he sw@@ are unto her , whatsoever thou shalt ask of me , I will give it thee , unto the half of my kingdom .
and she came in strai@@ gh@@ tw@@ ay with ha@@ ste unto the king , and asked , saying , I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist .
and when his disciples heard of it , they came and took up his corpse , and laid it in a tomb .
and the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus , and told him all things , both what they had done , and what they had taught .
and he said unto them , Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place , and rest a while : for there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat .
and Jesus , when he came out , saw much people , and was moved with compassion toward them , because they were as sheep not having a shepherd : and he began to teach them many things .
and when the day was now far spent , his disciples came unto him , and said , This is a desert place , and now the time is far passed :
send them away , that they may go into the country round about , and into the villages , and buy themselves bread : for they have nothing to eat .
he answered and said unto them , Gi@@ ve ye them to eat . and they say unto him , Sh@@ all we go and buy two hundred pen@@ ny@@ worth of bread , and give them to eat ?
and when he had taken the five lo@@ aves and the two f@@ ishes , he looked up to heaven , and blessed , and brake the lo@@ aves , and gave them to his disciples to set before them ; and the two f@@ ishes divided he among them all .
and strai@@ gh@@ tw@@ ay he constrained his disciples to get into the ship , and to go to the other side before unto Beth@@ s@@ aida , while he sent away the people .
and he saw them to@@ iling in rowing ; for the wind was contrary unto them : and about the fourth watch of the night he com@@ eth unto them , walking upon the sea , and would have passed by them .
for they all saw him , and were troubled . and immediately he talked with them , and sa@@ ith unto them , Be of good che@@ er : it is I ; be not afraid .
and he went up unto them into the ship ; and the wind ceased : and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure , and wondered .
and ran through that whole region round about , and began to carry about in beds those that were sick , where they heard he was .
then came together unto him the Pharis@@ ees , and certain of the scri@@ bes , which came from Jerusalem .
and when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with de@@ filed , that is to say , with un@@ wash@@ en , hands , they found fault .
for the Pharis@@ ees , and all the Jews , except they wash their hands oft , eat not , holding the tradition of the elders .
and when they come from the market , except they wash , they eat not . and many other things there be , which they have received to hold , as the washing of cups , and pots , br@@ as@@ en vessels , and of tables .
then the Pharis@@ ees and scri@@ bes asked him , Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders , but eat bread with un@@ wash@@ en hands ?
for laying aside the commandment of God , ye hold the tradition of men , as the washing of pots and cups : and many other such like things ye do .
there is nothing from without a man , that entering into him can def@@ ile him : but the things which come out of him , those are they that def@@ ile the man .
and he sa@@ ith unto them , Are ye so without understanding also ? do ye not perceive , that whatsoever thing from without enter@@ eth into the man , it C@@ AN@@ NOT def@@ ile him ;
and from th@@ ence he arose , and went into the borders of Ty@@ re and Sid@@ on , and entered into an house , and would have no man know it : but he could not be hid .
the woman was a Greek , a Sy@@ ro@@ phen@@ ician by nation ; and she bes@@ ought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter .
and he said unto her , For this saying go thy way ; the devil is gone out of thy daughter .
and were beyond measure astonished , saying , He hath done all things well : he mak@@ eth both the deaf to hear , and the dumb to speak .
and if I send them away fasting to their own houses , they will faint by the way : for divers of them came from far .
and he commanded the people to sit down on the ground : and he took the seven lo@@ aves , and gave thanks , and brake , and gave to his disciples to set before them ; and they did set them before the people .
and they had a few small f@@ ishes : and he blessed , and commanded to set them also before them .
and the Pharis@@ ees came forth , and began to question with him , seeking of him a sign from heaven , tempting him .
and he sigh@@ ed deeply in his spirit , and sa@@ ith , Why do@@ th this generation seek after a sign ? verily I say unto you , There shall no sign be given unto this generation .
and when the seven among four thousand , how many bas@@ kets full of fragments took ye up ? and they said , Seven .
and he took the blind man by the hand , and led him out of the town ; and when he had sp@@ it on his eyes , and put his hands upon him , he asked him if he saw ought .
after that he put his hands again upon his eyes , and made him look up : and he was restored , and saw every man clearly .
and he sent him away to his house , saying , N@@ either go into the town , nor tell it to any in the town .
and he sa@@ ith unto them , But whom say ye that I am ? and Peter answ@@ er@@ eth and sa@@ ith unto him , Th@@ ou art the Christ .
and he began to teach them , that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders , and of the chief priests , and scri@@ bes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
but when he had turned about and looked on his disciples , he rebu@@ ked Peter , saying , Get thee behind me , Satan : for thou sav@@ ou@@ rest not the things that be of God , but the things that be of men .
and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also , he said unto them , Wh@@ oso@@ ever will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
for what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ?
and he said unto them , Ver@@ ily I say unto you , That there be some of them that stand here , which shall not taste of death , till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power .
and after six days Jesus tak@@ eth with him Peter , and James , and John , and lead@@ eth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves : and he was trans@@ figured before them .
and Peter answered and said to Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tab@@ ern@@ acles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Eli@@ as .
and there was a cloud that over@@ shad@@ owed them : and a voice came out of the cloud , saying , This is my beloved Son : hear him .
and suddenly , when they had looked round about , they saw no man any more , save Jesus only with themselves .
and as they came down from the mountain , he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen , till the Son of man were risen from the dead .
and he answered and told them , Eli@@ as verily com@@ eth first , and rest@@ ore@@ th all things ; and how it is written of the Son of man , that he must suffer many things , and be set at n@@ ought .
but I say unto you , That Eli@@ as is indeed come , and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed , as it is written of him .
and when he came to his disciples , he saw a great multitude about them , and the scri@@ bes questioning with them .
and he asked his father , How long is it ago since this came unto him ? and he said , Of a child .
and of@@ t@@ times it hath cast him into the fire , and into the waters , to destroy him : but if thou can@@ st do any thing , have compassion on us , and help us .
when Jesus saw that the people came running together , he rebu@@ ked the foul spirit , saying unto him , Th@@ ou dumb and deaf spirit , I charge thee , come out of him , and enter no more into him .
and the spirit cried , and rent him sore , and came out of him : and he was as one dead ; in@@ som@@ uch that many said , He is dead .
for he taught his disciples , and said unto them , The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men , and they shall kill him ; and after that he is killed , he shall rise the third day .
but Jesus said , forbid him not : for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name , that can lightly speak evil of me .
for wh@@ oso@@ ever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name , because ye belong to Christ , verily I say unto you , he shall not lose his reward .
and wh@@ oso@@ ever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me , it is better for him that a mil@@ l@@ stone were han@@ ged about his neck , and he were cast into the sea .
and if thy hand offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life ma@@ im@@ ed , than having two hands to go into hell , into the fire that never shall be qu@@ en@@ ched :
and if thy foot offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter halt into life , than having two feet to be cast into hell , into the fire that never shall be qu@@ en@@ ched :
and if th@@ ine eye offend thee , pl@@ uck it out : it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye , than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire :
and if a woman shall put away her husband , and be married to another , she commit@@ t@@ eth adul@@ tery .
and they brought young children to him , that he should touch them : and his disciples rebu@@ ked those that brought them .
and when he was gone forth into the way , there came one running , and kne@@ eled to him , and asked him , Good Master , what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life ?
thou know@@ est the commandments , Do not commit adul@@ tery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Def@@ ra@@ ud not , Hon@@ our thy father and mother .
and Jesus looked round about , and sa@@ ith unto his disciples , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !
and the disciples were astonished at his words . but Jesus answ@@ er@@ eth again , and sa@@ ith unto them , Children , how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God !
but Jesus said unto them , Y@@ e know not what ye ask : can ye drink of the cup that I drink of ? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ?
and they said unto him , We can . and Jesus said unto them , Y@@ e shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of ; and with the baptism that I am baptized with@@ al shall ye be baptized :
but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give ; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared .
and when the ten heard it , they began to be much dis@@ pleased with James and John .
but Jesus called them to him , and sa@@ ith unto them , Y@@ e know that they which are accounted to rule over the Genti@@ les exercise l@@ ord@@ ship over them ; and their great ones exercise authority upon them .
and they came to Jer@@ ich@@ o : and as he went out of Jer@@ ich@@ o with his disciples and a great number of people , blind Bar@@ tim@@ a@@ eus , the son of Tim@@ a@@ eus , sat by the highway side begging .
and Jesus said unto him , Go thy way ; thy faith hath made thee whole . and immediately he received his sight , and followed Jesus in the way .
and when they came ni@@ gh to Jerusalem , unto Beth@@ p@@ ha@@ ge and Beth@@ any , at the mount of O@@ lives , he sen@@ det@@ h forth two of his disciples ,
and Jesus entered into Jerusalem , and into the temple : and when he had looked round about upon all things , and now the ev@@ enti@@ de was come , he went out unto Beth@@ any with the twelve .
and he taught , saying unto them , Is it not written , My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer ? but ye have made it a den of thieves .
and the scri@@ bes and chief priests heard it , and sought how they might destroy him : for they feared him , because all the people was astonished at his doctrine .
and say unto him , By what authority do@@ est thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority to do these things ?
and Jesus answered and said unto them , I will also ask of you one question , and answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
and they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why then did ye not believe him ?
but if we shall say , Of men ; they feared the people : for all men counted John , that he was a prophet indeed .
and they answered and said unto Jesus , We C@@ AN@@ NOT tell . and Jesus answering sa@@ ith unto them , N@@ either do I tell you by what authority I do these things .
but those Hus@@ band@@ men said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and the inheritance shall be ours .
and they sought to lay hold on him , but feared the people : for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them : and they left him , and went their way .
and they brought it . and he sa@@ ith unto them , Wh@@ ose is this image and su@@ pers@@ cription ? and they said unto him , Caes@@ ar 's .
and as touching the dead , that they rise : have ye not read in the book of Moses , how in the bush God sp@@ ake unto him , saying , I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ?
he is not the God of the dead , but the God of the living : ye therefore do greatly er@@ r .
and one of the scri@@ bes came , and having heard them reasoning together , and percei@@ ving that he had answered them well , asked him , Which is the first commandment of all ?
and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind , and with all thy strength : this is the first commandment .
and the second is like , namely this , Th@@ ou shalt love thy neighbour as thy@@ self . there is none other commandment greater than these .
and the scri@@ be said unto him , Well , Master , thou hast said the truth : for there is one God ; and there is none other but he :
and to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbour as himself , is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices .
and when Jesus saw that he answered discre@@ etly , he said unto him , Th@@ ou art not far from the kingdom of God . and no man after that Dur@@ st ask him any question .
and Jesus answered and said , while he taught in the temple , How say the scri@@ bes that Christ is the Son of David ?
for David himself said by the Holy Ghost , The Lord said to my Lord , S@@ it thou on my right hand , till I make th@@ ine enemies thy foot@@ stool .
and he said unto them in his doctrine , B@@ ew@@ are of the scri@@ bes , which love to go in long clothing , and love sal@@ ut@@ ations in the market@@ places ,
which dev@@ our wid@@ ows ' houses , and for a pret@@ ence make long prayers : these shall receive greater dam@@ nation .
and Jesus sat over against the treasury , and be@@ held how the people cast money into the treasury : and many that were rich cast in much .
and as he went out of the temple , one of his disciples sa@@ ith unto him , Master , see what manner of stones and what buildings are here !
tell us , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled ?
and when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars , be ye not troubled : for such things must needs be ; but the end shall not be yet .
but take heed to yourselves : for they shall deliver you up to councils ; and in the syn@@ agogues ye shall be beaten : and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them .
but when ye shall see the ab@@ om@@ ination of des@@ ol@@ ation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , standing where it ought not , ( let him that read@@ eth understand , ) then let them that be in Juda@@ ea flee to the mountains :
and let him that is on the hous@@ et@@ op not go down into the house , neither enter therein , to take any thing out of his house :
and except that the Lord had shortened those days , no flesh should be saved : but for the elect 's sake , whom he hath chosen , he hath shortened the days .
and then if any man shall say to you , L@@ o , here is Christ ; or , lo , he is there ; believe him not :
for false Ch@@ rists and false prophets shall rise , and shall sh@@ ew signs and wonders , to se@@ duce , if it were possible , even the elect .
now learn a parable of the fi@@ g tree ; When her branch is yet tender , and put@@ t@@ eth forth leaves , ye know that summer is near :
verily I say unto you , that this generation shall not pass , till all these things be done .
but of that day and that hour know@@ eth no man , no , not the angels which are in heaven , neither the Son , but the Father .
for the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey , who left his house , and gave authority to his servants , and to every man his work , and commanded the porter to watch .
watch ye therefore : for ye know not when the master of the house com@@ eth , at even , or at midnight , or at the cock@@ crow@@ ing , or in the morning :
and being in Beth@@ any in the house of Simon the le@@ per , as he sat at meat , there came a woman having an al@@ ab@@ aster box of o@@ int@@ ment of sp@@ ik@@ en@@ ard very precious ; and she brake the box , and poured it on his head .
for it might have been sold for more than three hundred p@@ ence , and have been given to the poor . and they mur@@ mu@@ red against her .
and the first day of un@@ leav@@ ened bread , when they killed the pas@@ sover , his disciples said unto him , Where wil@@ t thou that we go and prepare that thou may@@ est eat the pas@@ sover ?
and he sen@@ det@@ h forth two of his disciples , and sa@@ ith unto them , Go ye into the city , and there shall meet you a man bearing a p@@ itch@@ er of water : follow him .
and wher@@ eso@@ ever he shall go in , say ye to the good@@ man of the house , The Master sa@@ ith , Where is the guest@@ chamber , where I shall eat the pas@@ sover with my disciples ?
and they began to be sor@@ row@@ ful , and to say unto him one by one , Is it I ? and another said , Is it I ?
and he answered and said unto them , It is one of the twelve , that di@@ pp@@ eth with me in the dish .
the Son of man indeed go@@ eth , as it is written of him : but w@@ oe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed ! good were it for that man if he had never been born .
and as they did eat , Jesus took bread , and blessed , and brake it , and gave to them , and said , Take , eat : this is my body .
and he said unto them , This is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many .
verily I say unto you , I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine , until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God .
and they came to a place which was named Ge@@ th@@ sem@@ ane : and he sa@@ ith to his disciples , S@@ it ye here , while I shall pray .
and he tak@@ eth with him Peter and James and John , and began to be sore amazed , and to be very heavy ;
and he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass from him .
and he said , Ab@@ ba , Father , all things are possible unto thee ; take away this cup from me : nevertheless not what I will , but what thou wil@@ t .
watch ye and pray , lest ye enter into temptation . the spirit truly is ready , but the flesh is weak .
and immediately , while he yet sp@@ ake , com@@ eth Jud@@ as , one of the twelve , and with him a great multitude with s@@ words and st@@ aves , from the chief priests and the scri@@ bes and the elders .
and he that betrayed him had given them a token , saying , wh@@ om@@ soever I shall kiss , that same is he ; take him , and lead him away safely .
and as soon as he was come , he go@@ eth strai@@ gh@@ tw@@ ay to him , and sa@@ ith , Master , master ; and kis@@ sed him .
and Jesus answered and said unto them , Are ye come out , as against a thief , with s@@ words and with st@@ aves to take me ?
and there followed him a certain young man , having a linen cloth cast about his naked body ; and the young men laid hold on him :
and Peter followed him af@@ ar off , even into the palace of the high priest : and he sat with the servants , and war@@ med himself at the fire .
we heard him say , I will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and within three days I will build another made without hands .
and the high priest stood up in the midst , and asked Jesus , saying , Answ@@ er@@ est thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ?
but he held his peace , and answered nothing . again the high priest asked him , and said unto him , Art thou the Christ , the Son of the Bless@@ ed ?
ye have heard the bl@@ asph@@ emy : what think ye ? and they all condemned him to be guilty of death .
and some began to sp@@ it on him , and to cover his face , and to buffet him , and to say unto him , Proph@@ esy : and the servants did strike him with the pal@@ ms of their hands .
and when she saw Peter warming himself , she looked upon him , and said , And thou also w@@ ast with Jesus of Naz@@ areth .
and he denied it again . and a little after , they that stood by said again to Peter , Su@@ rely thou art one of them : for thou art a Gal@@ il@@ a@@ ean , and thy speech agre@@ eth there@@ to .
and the second time the cock crew . and Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him , Before the cock c@@ row twice , thou shalt deny me thr@@ ice . and when he thought there@@ on , he we@@ pt .
and there was one named Bar@@ ab@@ bas , which lay bound with them that had made insurrec@@ tion with him , who had committed murder in the insurrec@@ tion .
but Pil@@ ate answered them , saying , Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews ?
then Pil@@ ate said unto them , Why , what evil hath he done ? and they cried out the more exceedingly , Cru@@ ci@@ fy him .
and so Pil@@ ate , willing to content the people , released Bar@@ ab@@ bas unto them , and delivered Jesus , when he had scour@@ ged him , to be cruci@@ fied .
and when they had mo@@ cked him , they took off the purple from him , and put his own clothes on him , and led him out to cruci@@ fy him .
and at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , E@@ lo@@ i , E@@ lo@@ i , l@@ ama sab@@ ach@@ than@@ i ? which is , being interpreted , My God , my God , why hast thou for@@ s@@ aken me ?
and some of them that stood by , when they heard it , said , Be@@ hold , he call@@ eth Eli@@ as .
and one ran and filled a sp@@ un@@ ge full of vin@@ eg@@ ar , and put it on a re@@ ed , and gave him to drink , saying , Let alone ; let us see whether Eli@@ as will come to take him down .
and when the cent@@ ur@@ ion , which stood over against him , saw that he so cried out , and gave up the ghost , he said , Tru@@ ly this man was the Son of God .
Joseph of Ari@@ ma@@ th@@ a@@ ea , and hon@@ our@@ able coun@@ seller , which also waited for the kingdom of God , came , and went in boldly unto Pil@@ ate , and cra@@ ved the body of Jesus .
and he bought fine linen , and took him down , and wrapped him in the linen , and laid him in a se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re which was he@@ wn out of a rock , and rolled a stone unto the door of the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re .
and very early in the morning the first day of the week , they came unto the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re at the rising of the sun .
and entering into the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , they saw a young man sitting on the right side , clo@@ thed in a long white garment ; and they were aff@@ righ@@ ted .
and he sa@@ ith unto them , Be not aff@@ righ@@ ted : ye seek Jesus of Naz@@ areth , which was cruci@@ fied : he is risen ; he is not here : behold the place where they laid him .
and they went out quickly , and fled from the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re ; for they trem@@ bled and were amazed : neither said they any thing to any man ; for they were afraid .
and she went and told them that had been with him , as they mour@@ ned and we@@ pt .
afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat , and up@@ bra@@ ided them with their un@@ belief and hard@@ ness of heart , because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen .
and he said unto them , Go ye into all the world , and preach the gospel to every creature .
and these signs shall follow them that believe ; In my name shall they cast out dev@@ ils ; they shall speak with new tongues ;
they shall take up ser@@ p@@ ents ; and if they drink any deadly thing , it shall not hurt them ; they shall lay hands on the sick , and they shall recover .
and they went forth , and preached everywhere , the Lord working with them , and confirming the word with signs following . A@@ men .
according to the custom of the priest 's office , his lot was to burn inc@@ ense when he went into the temple of the Lord .
but the angel said unto him , Fe@@ ar not , Z@@ ach@@ ari@@ as : for thy prayer is heard ; and thy wife Elis@@ abeth shall bear thee a son , and thou shalt call his name John .
and Z@@ ach@@ ari@@ as said unto the angel , whereby shall I know this ? for I am an old man , and my wife well stricken in years .
to a virgin esp@@ oused to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David ; and the virgin 's name was Mary .
and the angel came in unto her , and said , H@@ ail , thou that art highly fav@@ oured , the Lord is with thee : blessed art thou among women .
and when she saw him , she was troubled at his saying , and cast in her mind what manner of sal@@ ut@@ ation this should be .
and , behold , thou shalt conceive in thy womb , and bring forth a son , and shalt call his name J@@ ES@@ US .
and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever ; and of his kingdom there shall be no end .
and , behold , thy cousin Elis@@ abeth , she hath also conceived a son in her old age : and this is the sixth month with her , who was called bar@@ ren .
and she sp@@ ake out with a loud voice , and said , Bless@@ ed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb .
for he hath regarded the low estate of his hand@@ mai@@ den : for , behold , from h@@ ence@@ forth all generations shall call me blessed .
and fear came on all that d@@ wel@@ t round about them : and all these say@@ ings were no@@ ised abroad throughout all the hill country of Juda@@ ea .
and all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts , saying , What manner of child shall this be ! and the hand of the Lord was with him .
and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David ;
that we should be saved from our enemies , and from the hand of all that hate us ;
through the tender mercy of our God ; whereby the day@@ spring from on high hath visited us ,
and the child grew , and wa@@ xed strong in spirit , and was in the deserts till the day of his sh@@ ew@@ ing unto Israel .
and Joseph also went up from Gal@@ ilee , out of the city of Naz@@ areth , into Juda@@ ea , unto the city of David , which is called Bethlehem ; ( because he was of the house and line@@ age of David : )
and she brought forth her fir@@ st@@ born son , and wrapped him in sw@@ add@@ ling clothes , and laid him in a man@@ ger ; because there was no room for them in the inn .
for unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour , which is Christ the Lord .
and when they had seen it , they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child .
and when eight days were accomplished for the circum@@ c@@ ising of the child , his name was called J@@ ES@@ US , which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
and when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished , they brought him to Jerusalem , to present him to the Lord ;
( as it is written in the law of the Lord , Every male that open@@ eth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord ; )
and , behold , there was a man in Jerusalem , whose name was Sim@@ eon ; and the same man was just and dev@@ out , waiting for the consolation of Israel : and the Holy Ghost was upon him .
and it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost , that he should not see death , before he had seen the Lord 's Christ .
and he came by the Spirit into the temple : and when the parents brought in the child Jesus , to do for him after the custom of the law ,
and Sim@@ eon blessed them , and said unto Mary his mother , Be@@ hold , this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel ; and for a sign which shall be spoken against ;
and there was one Anna , a proph@@ et@@ ess , the daughter of P@@ han@@ u@@ el , of the tribe of As@@ er : she was of a great age , and had lived with an husband seven years from her vir@@ g@@ inity ;
and she was a widow of about four@@ score and four years , which departed not from the temple , but served God with fast@@ ings and prayers night and day .
and she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord , and sp@@ ake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem .
and when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord , they returned into Gal@@ ilee , to their own city Naz@@ areth .
and the child grew , and wa@@ xed strong in spirit , filled with wisdom : and the grace of God was upon him .
and when they had fulfilled the days , as they returned , the child Jesus tar@@ ried behind in Jerusalem ; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it .
but they , sup@@ posing him to have been in the company , went a day 's journey ; and they sought him among their kin@@ s@@ folk and acquaintance .
now in the fif@@ teenth year of the reign of Ti@@ b@@ eri@@ us Caes@@ ar , Pon@@ ti@@ us Pil@@ ate being governor of Juda@@ ea , and Her@@ od being te@@ tr@@ arch of Gal@@ ilee , and his brother Philip te@@ tr@@ arch of I@@ tur@@ a@@ ea and of the region of Tr@@ ach@@ on@@ itis , and L@@ ys@@ ani@@ as the te@@ tr@@ arch of A@@ bil@@ ene ,
bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and begin not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
and now also the ax@@ e is laid unto the root of the trees : every tree therefore which br@@ ing@@ eth not forth good fruit is he@@ wn down , and cast into the fire .
he answ@@ er@@ eth and sa@@ ith unto them , He that hath two coats , let him im@@ part to him that hath none ; and he that hath meat , let him do likewise .
and the soldiers likewise demanded of him , saying , And what shall we do ? and he said unto them , Do violence to no man , neither accuse any fal@@ sely ; and be content with your wages .
and as the people were in expectation , and all men m@@ used in their hearts of John , whether he were the Christ , or not ;
John answered , saying unto them all , I indeed bap@@ ti@@ ze you with water ; but one mi@@ gh@@ tier than I com@@ eth , the lat@@ ch@@ et of whose shoes I am not worthy to un@@ loose : he shall bap@@ ti@@ ze you with the Holy Ghost and with fire :
whose fan is in his hand , and he will through@@ ly purge his floor , and will gather the wheat into his gar@@ ner ; but the cha@@ ff he will burn with fire un@@ qu@@ en@@ ch@@ able .
and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a do@@ ve upon him , and a voice came from heaven , which said , Th@@ ou art my beloved Son ; in thee I am well pleased .
and Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age , being ( as was supposed ) the son of Joseph , which was the son of Hel@@ i ,
and Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan , and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness ,
and the devil said unto him , If thou be the Son of God , command this stone that it be made bread .
and Jesus answered him , saying , It is written , That man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of God .
and the devil , taking him up into an high mountain , sh@@ ew@@ ed unto him all the king@@ doms of the world in a moment of time .
and the devil said unto him , All this power will I give thee , and the glory of them : for that is delivered unto me ; and to wh@@ om@@ soever I will I give it .
and Jesus answered and said unto him , Get thee behind me , Satan : for it is written , Th@@ ou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve .
and he brought him to Jerusalem , and set him on a pin@@ n@@ acle of the temple , and said unto him , If thou be the Son of God , cast thy@@ self down from hence :
and Jesus answering said unto him , It is said , Th@@ ou shalt not temp@@ t the Lord thy God .
and Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Gal@@ ilee : and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about .
and he came to Naz@@ areth , where he had been brought up : and , as his custom was , he went into the synagogue on the sab@@ bath day , and stood up for to read .
and all bare him witness , and wondered at the gr@@ acious words which proceeded out of his mouth . and they said , Is not this Joseph 's son ?
but I tell you of a truth , many wid@@ ows were in Israel in the days of Eli@@ as , when the heaven was shut up three years and six months , when great famine was throughout all the land ;
but unto none of them was Eli@@ as sent , save unto S@@ are@@ p@@ ta , a city of Sid@@ on , unto a woman that was a widow .
and many le@@ pers were in Israel in the time of Elis@@ eus the prophet ; and none of them was cleans@@ ed , saving Na@@ aman the Syrian .
and rose up , and thrust him out of the city , and led him unto the bro@@ w of the hill where@@ on their city was built , that they might cast him down head@@ long .
and Jesus rebu@@ ked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him . and when the devil had thrown him in the midst , he came out of him , and hurt him not .
and they were all amazed , and sp@@ ake among themselves , saying , What a word is this ! for with authority and power he comman@@ det@@ h the un@@ clean spirits , and they come out .
and he arose out of the synagogue , and entered into Simon 's house . and Simon 's wife 's mother was taken with a great fever ; and they bes@@ ought him for her .
now when the sun was setting , all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and healed them .
and dev@@ ils also came out of many , crying out , and saying , Th@@ ou art Christ the Son of God . and he rebu@@ king them suffered them not to speak : for they knew that he was Christ .
now when he had left speaking , he said unto Simon , Launch out into the deep , and let down your nets for a drau@@ ght .
and Simon answering said unto him , Master , we have to@@ iled all the night , and have taken nothing : nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net .
and they bec@@ k@@ oned unto their partners , which were in the other ship , that they should come and help them . and they came , and filled both the ships , so that they began to sink .
when Simon Peter saw it , he fell down at Jesus ' knees , saying , De@@ part from me ; for I am a sinful man , O Lord .
and so was also James , and John , the sons of Ze@@ be@@ dee , which were partners with Simon . and Jesus said unto Simon , Fe@@ ar not ; from h@@ ence@@ forth thou shalt catch men .
and it came to pass , when he was in a certain city , behold a man full of le@@ pro@@ sy : who seeing Jesus fell on his face , and bes@@ ought him , saying , Lord , if thou wil@@ t , thou can@@ st make me clean .
and he put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will : be thou clean . and immediately the le@@ pro@@ sy departed from him .
and he charged him to tell no man : but go , and sh@@ ew thy@@ self to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing , according as Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
but so much the more went there a fame abroad of him : and great multi@@ tudes came together to hear , and to be healed by him of their in@@ firm@@ ities .
whether is easier , to say , Th@@ y sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , R@@ ise up and walk ?
but that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins , ( he said unto the sick of the pal@@ sy , ) I say unto thee , A@@ rise , and take up thy couch , and go into th@@ ine house .
and after these things he went forth , and saw a public@@ an , named Lev@@ i , sitting at the receipt of custom : and he said unto him , Fol@@ low me .
and they said unto him , Why do the disciples of John fast often , and make prayers , and likewise the disciples of the Pharis@@ ees ; but th@@ ine eat and drink ?
and he said unto them , Can ye make the children of the bri@@ dec@@ ham@@ ber fast , while the bri@@ deg@@ room is with them ?
and he sp@@ ake also a parable unto them ; No man put@@ t@@ eth a piece of a new garment upon an old ; if otherwise , then both the new mak@@ eth a rent , and the piece that was taken out of the new agre@@ eth not with the old .
and certain of the Pharis@@ ees said unto them , Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sab@@ bath days ?
and Jesus answering them said , Have ye not read so much as this , what David did , when himself was an hun@@ g@@ red , and they which were with him ;
how he went into the house of God , and did take and eat the sh@@ ew@@ bread , and gave also to them that were with him ; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone ?
and it came to pass also on another sab@@ bath , that he entered into the synagogue and taught : and there was a man whose right hand was with@@ ered .
but he knew their thoughts , and said to the man which had the with@@ ered hand , R@@ ise up , and stand forth in the midst . and he arose and stood forth .
then said Jesus unto them , I will ask you one thing ; Is it lawful on the sab@@ bath days to do good , or to do evil ? to save life , or to destroy it ?
and when it was day , he called unto him his disciples : and of them he chose twelve , whom also he named apostles ;
and they that were v@@ exed with un@@ clean spirits : and they were healed .
blessed are ye , when men shall hate you , and when they shall separate you from their company , and shall repro@@ ach you , and cast out your name as evil , for the Son of man 's sake .
w@@ oe unto you that are full ! for ye shall hunger . w@@ oe unto you that laugh now ! for ye shall mour@@ n and we@@ ep .
give to every man that as@@ ket@@ h of thee ; and of him that tak@@ eth away thy goods ask them not again .
but love ye your enemies , and do good , and lend , hoping for nothing again ; and your reward shall be great , and ye shall be the children of the High@@ est : for he is kind unto the un@@ thankful and to the evil .
judge not , and ye shall not be judged : condemn not , and ye shall not be condemned : forgive , and ye shall be forgiven :
give , and it shall be given unto you ; good measure , pressed down , and shaken together , and running over , shall men give into your bos@@ om . for with the same measure that ye met@@ e with@@ al it shall be measured to you again .
and he sp@@ ake a parable unto them , Can the blind lead the blind ? shall they not both fall into the ditch ?
and why be@@ hol@@ dest thou the mo@@ te that is in thy brother 's eye , but percei@@ v@@ est not the beam that is in th@@ ine own eye ?
for every tree is known by his own fruit . for of thor@@ ns men do not gather fi@@ gs , nor of a br@@ am@@ ble bush gather they grapes .
but he that he@@ areth , and do@@ eth not , is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth ; against which the stream did beat ve@@ hem@@ ently , and immediately it fell ; and the ruin of that house was great .
and a certain cent@@ ur@@ ion 's servant , who was dear unto him , was sick , and ready to die .
and when he heard of Jesus , he sent unto him the elders of the Jews , bes@@ e@@ ech@@ ing him that he would come and heal his servant .
then Jesus went with them . and when he was now not far from the house , the cent@@ ur@@ ion sent friends to him , saying unto him , Lord , trouble not thy@@ self : for I am not worthy that thou shoul@@ dest enter under my roof :
and it came to pass the day after , that he went into a city called N@@ ain ; and many of his disciples went with him , and much people .
now when he came ni@@ gh to the gate of the city , behold , there was a dead man carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow : and much people of the city was with her .
and when the Lord saw her , he had compassion on her , and said unto her , We@@ ep not .
and he came and touched the bi@@ er : and they that bare him stood still . and he said , Young man , I say unto thee , A@@ rise .
and there came a fear on all : and they glori@@ fied God , saying , That a great prophet is risen up among us ; and , That God hath visited his people .
and this rum@@ our of him went forth throughout all Juda@@ ea , and throughout all the region round about .
when the men were come unto him , they said , John Baptist hath sent us unto thee , saying , Art thou he that should come ? or look we for another ?
and in that same hour he cured many of their in@@ firm@@ ities and pl@@ agues , and of evil spirits ; and unto many that were blind he gave sight .
and when the messengers of John were departed , he began to speak unto the people concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness for to see ? a re@@ ed shaken with the wind ?
but what went ye out for to see ? a man clo@@ thed in soft ra@@ iment ? behold , they which are gor@@ ge@@ ously ap@@ pa@@ rel@@ led , and live delic@@ ately , are in kings ' courts .
but what went ye out for to see ? a prophet ? ye@@ a , I say unto you , and much more than a prophet .
and all the people that heard him , and the public@@ ans , justified God , being baptized with the baptism of John .
and the Lord said , W@@ here@@ unto then shall I lik@@ en the men of this generation ? and to what are they like ?
they are like unto children sitting in the marketplace , and calling one to another , and saying , We have pi@@ ped unto you , and ye have not danced ; we have mour@@ ned to you , and ye have not we@@ pt .
and one of the Pharis@@ ees desired him that he would eat with him . and he went into the Pharis@@ ee 's house , and sat down to meat .
and , behold , a woman in the city , which was a sinner , when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharis@@ ee 's house , brought an al@@ ab@@ aster box of o@@ int@@ ment ,
and stood at his feet behind him we@@ eping , and began to wash his feet with tears , and did wipe them with the ha@@ irs of her head , and kis@@ sed his feet , and ano@@ inted them with the o@@ int@@ ment .
now when the Pharis@@ ee which had bid@@ den him saw it , he sp@@ ake within himself , saying , This man , if he were a prophet , would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touch@@ eth him : for she is a sinner .
Simon answered and said , I suppose that he , to whom he for@@ gave most . and he said unto him , Th@@ ou hast rightly judged .
W@@ herefore I say unto thee , Her sins , which are many , are forgiven ; for she loved much : but to whom little is forgiven , the same lov@@ eth little .
a s@@ ower went out to sow his seed : and as he s@@ owed , some fell by the way side ; and it was tro@@ dden down , and the f@@ ow@@ ls of the air dev@@ oured it .
and some fell upon a rock ; and as soon as it was sp@@ run@@ g up , it with@@ ered away , because it lacked moisture .
and other fell on good ground , and sprang up , and bare fruit an hundre@@ d@@ fold . and when he had said these things , he cried , He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
and he said , Un@@ to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God : but to others in par@@ ables ; that seeing they might not see , and hearing they might not understand .
and that which fell among thor@@ ns are they , which , when they have heard , go forth , and are cho@@ ked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life , and bring no fruit to perfection .
and it was told him by certain which said , Th@@ y mother and thy brethren stand without , desi@@ ring to see thee .
and he answered and said unto them , My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God , and do it .
but as they s@@ ailed he fell asleep : and there came down a storm of wind on the lake ; and they were filled with water , and were in jeopar@@ dy .
and they came to him , and aw@@ oke him , saying , Master , master , we perish . then he arose , and rebu@@ ked the wind and the raging of the water : and they ceased , and there was a calm .
and he said unto them , Where is your faith ? and they being afraid wondered , saying one to another , What manner of man is this ! for he comman@@ det@@ h even the winds and water , and they obey him .
when he saw Jesus , he cried out , and fell down before him , and with a loud voice said , What have I to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of God most high ? I bes@@ e@@ ech thee , tor@@ ment me not .
and there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain : and they bes@@ ought him that he would suffer them to enter into them . and he suffered them .
then they went out to see what was done ; and came to Jesus , and found the man , out of whom the dev@@ ils were departed , sitting at the feet of Jesus , clo@@ thed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
and , behold , there came a man named J@@ air@@ us , and he was a ruler of the synagogue : and he fell down at Jesus ' feet , and bes@@ ought him that he would come into his house :
and when the woman saw that she was not hid , she came trembling , and falling down before him , she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately .
while he yet sp@@ ake , there com@@ eth one from the ruler of the synagogue 's house , saying to him , Th@@ y daughter is dead ; trouble not the Master .
but when Jesus heard it , he answered him , saying , Fe@@ ar not : believe only , and she shall be made whole .
then he called his twelve disciples together , and gave them power and authority over all dev@@ ils , and to cure diseases .
now Her@@ od the te@@ tr@@ arch heard of all that was done by him : and he was perpl@@ exed , because that it was said of some , that John was risen from the dead ;
and of some , that Eli@@ as had appeared ; and of others , that one of the old prophets was risen again .
and the apostles , when they were returned , told him all that they had done . and he took them , and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Beth@@ s@@ aida .
and the people , when they knew it , followed him : and he received them , and sp@@ ake unto them of the kingdom of God , and healed them that had need of healing .
but he said unto them , Gi@@ ve ye them to eat . and they said , We have no more but five lo@@ aves and two f@@ ishes ; except we should go and buy meat for all this people .
then he took the five lo@@ aves and the two f@@ ishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed them , and brake , and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude .
and they did eat , and were all filled : and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve bas@@ kets .
and it came to pass , as he was alone praying , his disciples were with him : and he asked them , saying , Who@@ m say the people that I am ?
saying , The Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scri@@ bes , and be sl@@ ain , and be raised the third day .
and he said to them all , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me .
for what is a man advantaged , if he gain the whole world , and lose himself , or be cast away ?
but I tell you of a truth , there be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the kingdom of God .
and it came to pass about an eight days after these say@@ ings , he took Peter and John and James , and went up into a mountain to pray .
but Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep : and when they were awake , they saw his glory , and the two men that stood with him .
and it came to pass , as they departed from him , Peter said unto Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tab@@ ern@@ acles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Eli@@ as : not knowing what he said .
and when the voice was past , Jesus was found alone . and they kept it close , and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen .
and as he was yet a coming , the devil threw him down , and tare him . and Jesus rebu@@ ked the un@@ clean spirit , and healed the child , and delivered him again to his father .
and they were all amazed at the mighty power of God . but while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did , he said unto his disciples ,
let these say@@ ings sink down into your ears : for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men .
for the Son of man is not come to destroy men 's lives , but to save them . and they went to another village .
and it came to pass , that , as they went in the way , a certain man said unto him , Lord , I will follow thee whi@@ ther@@ soever thou go@@ est .
and Jesus said unto him , fo@@ xes have holes , and birds of the air have ne@@ sts ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head .
and another also said , Lord , I will follow thee ; but let me first go bid them farewell , which are at home at my house .
and Jesus said unto him , No man , having put his hand to the pl@@ ough , and looking back , is fit for the kingdom of God .
and heal the sick that are therein , and say unto them , The kingdom of God is come ni@@ gh unto you .
but into whatsoever city ye enter , and they receive you not , go your ways out into the streets of the same , and say ,
w@@ oe unto thee , Ch@@ or@@ az@@ in ! w@@ oe unto thee , Beth@@ s@@ aida ! for if the mighty works had been done in Ty@@ re and Sid@@ on , which have been done in you , they had a great while ago rep@@ ented , sitting in s@@ ack@@ cloth and ashes .
he that he@@ areth you he@@ areth me ; and he that desp@@ is@@ eth you desp@@ is@@ eth me ; and he that desp@@ is@@ eth me desp@@ is@@ eth him that sent me .
behold , I give unto you power to t@@ read on ser@@ p@@ ents and scor@@ pi@@ ons , and over all the power of the enemy : and nothing shall by any means hurt you .
in that hour Jesus rejo@@ iced in spirit , and said , I thank thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto bab@@ es : even so , Father ; for so it seemed good in thy sight .
for I tell you , that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
and he answering said , Th@@ ou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy strength , and with all thy mind ; and thy neighbour as thy@@ self .
and Jesus answering said , A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jer@@ ich@@ o , and fell among thieves , which stripped him of his ra@@ iment , and wounded him , and departed , leaving him half dead .
and went to him , and bound up his wounds , pouring in oil and wine , and set him on his own beast , and brought him to an inn , and took care of him .
and on the mor@@ row when he departed , he took out two p@@ ence , and gave them to the host , and said unto him , Take care of him ; and whatsoever thou sp@@ end@@ est more , when I come again , I will repay thee .
which now of these three , thin@@ k@@ est thou , was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves ?
now it came to pass , as they went , that he entered into a certain village : and a certain woman named Mar@@ tha received him into her house .
but Mar@@ tha was cum@@ bered about much serving , and came to him , and said , Lord , d@@ ost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone ? bid her therefore that she help me .
but one thing is need@@ ful : and Mary hath chosen that good part , which shall not be taken away from her .
and it came to pass , that , as he was praying in a certain place , when he ceased , one of his disciples said unto him , Lord , teach us to pray , as John also taught his disciples .
for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me , and I have nothing to set before him ?
I say unto you , Th@@ ough he will not rise and give him , because he is his friend , yet because of his import@@ unity he will rise and give him as many as he need@@ eth .
if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father , will he give him a stone ? or if he ask a fish , will he for a fish give him a ser@@ pent ?
if ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children : how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him ?
when the un@@ clean spirit is gone out of a man , he wal@@ ket@@ h through dry places , seeking rest ; and finding none , he sa@@ ith , I will return unto my house wh@@ ence I came out .
then go@@ eth he , and tak@@ eth to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself ; and they enter in , and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first .
and when the people were gathered thick together , he began to say , This is an evil generation : they seek a sign ; and there shall no sign be given it , but the sign of Jon@@ as the prophet .
no man , when he hath lighted a candle , put@@ t@@ eth it in a secret place , neither under a b@@ ush@@ el , but on a cand@@ les@@ tick , that they which come in may see the light .
the light of the body is the eye : therefore when th@@ ine eye is single , thy whole body also is full of light ; but when th@@ ine eye is evil , thy body also is full of darkness .
if thy whole body therefore be full of light , having no part dark , the whole shall be full of light , as when the bright shining of a candle do@@ th give thee light .
and as he sp@@ ake , a certain Pharis@@ ee bes@@ ought him to dine with him : and he went in , and sat down to meat .
and the Lord said unto him , Now do ye Pharis@@ ees make clean the outside of the cup and the plat@@ ter ; but your inward part is full of ra@@ ven@@ ing and w@@ ick@@ edness .
but w@@ oe unto you , Pharis@@ ees ! for ye ti@@ the min@@ t and ru@@ e and all manner of herbs , and pass over judgment and the love of God : these ought ye to have done , and not to leave the other un@@ done .
w@@ oe unto you , Pharis@@ ees ! for ye love the up@@ per@@ most seats in the syn@@ agogues , and greetings in the markets .
w@@ oe unto you , scri@@ bes and Pharis@@ ees , hypo@@ crit@@ es ! for ye are as graves which appear not , and the men that walk over them are not aware of them .
and he said , W@@ oe unto you also , ye lawyers ! for ye L@@ ade men with burdens griev@@ ous to be borne , and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers .
w@@ oe unto you ! for ye build the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
from the blood of A@@ bel unto the blood of Z@@ ach@@ ari@@ as , which perished between the altar and the temple : verily I say unto you , It shall be required of this generation .
and as he said these things unto them , the scri@@ bes and the Pharis@@ ees began to urge him ve@@ hem@@ ently , and to provoke him to speak of many things :
but I will fore@@ warn you whom ye shall fear : fear him , which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell ; ye@@ a , I say unto you , Fe@@ ar him .
also I say unto you , Wh@@ oso@@ ever shall confess me before men , him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God :
and wh@@ oso@@ ever shall speak a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but unto him that bl@@ asph@@ em@@ eth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven .
and when they bring you unto the syn@@ agogues , and unto magistr@@ ates , and powers , take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer , or what ye shall say :
and he sp@@ ake a parable unto them , saying , The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plenti@@ fully :
and he thought within himself , saying , What shall I do , because I have no room where to best@@ ow my fruits ?
and he said , This will I do : I will pull down my bar@@ ns , and build greater ; and there will I best@@ ow all my fruits and my goods .
and I will say to my soul , Soul , thou hast much goods laid up for many years ; take th@@ ine ease , eat , drink , and be mer@@ ry .
but God said unto him , Th@@ ou fool , this night thy soul shall be required of thee : then whose shall those things be , which thou hast provided ?
and he said unto his disciples , T@@ herefore I say unto you , Take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat ; neither for the body , what ye shall put on .
if then God so clo@@ the the grass , which is to day in the field , and to mor@@ row is cast into the oven ; how much more will he clo@@ the you , O ye of little faith ?
fear not , little flock ; for it is your Father 's good pleasure to give you the kingdom .
sell that ye have , and give al@@ ms ; provide yourselves bags which wax not old , a treasure in the heavens that fail@@ eth not , where no thief appro@@ ach@@ eth , neither moth corrup@@ t@@ eth .
and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord , when he will return from the wedding ; that when he com@@ eth and kno@@ c@@ ket@@ h , they may open unto him immediately .
and this know , that if the good@@ man of the house had known what hour the thief would come , he would have watched , and not have suffered his house to be broken through .
and the Lord said , Who then is that faithful and wise ste@@ ward , whom his lord shall make ruler over his household , to give them their portion of meat in due season ?
but and if that servant say in his heart , My lord del@@ ay@@ eth his coming ; and shall begin to beat the men@@ servants and mai@@ dens , and to eat and drink , and to be drun@@ ken ;
the lord of that servant will come in a day when he loo@@ ket@@ h not for him , and at an hour when he is not aware , and will cut him in s@@ under , and will appoint him his portion with the un@@ believers .
but he that knew not , and did commit things worthy of stri@@ pes , shall be beaten with few stri@@ pes . for unto wh@@ om@@ soever much is given , of him shall be much required : and to whom men have committed much , of him they will ask the more .
but I have a baptism to be baptized with ; and how am I stra@@ it@@ ened till it be accomplished !
and he said also to the people , When ye see a cloud rise out of the west , strai@@ gh@@ tw@@ ay ye say , There com@@ eth a shower ; and so it is .
then said he unto the d@@ res@@ ser of his viney@@ ard , Be@@ hold , these three years I come seeking fruit on this fi@@ g tree , and find none : cut it down ; why cumber@@ eth it the ground ?
and when Jesus saw her , he called her to him , and said unto her , Woman , thou art loos@@ ed from th@@ ine in@@ firm@@ ity .
and the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation , because that Jesus had healed on the sab@@ bath day , and said unto the people , There are six days in which men ought to work : in them therefore come and be healed , and not on the sab@@ bath day .
the Lord then answered him , and said , Th@@ ou hypo@@ cr@@ ite , do@@ th not each one of you on the sab@@ bath loose his ox or his ass from the stall , and lead him away to wat@@ ering ?
and ought not this woman , being a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan hath bound , lo , these eighteen years , be loos@@ ed from this bond on the sab@@ bath day ?
and when he had said these things , all his adversaries were ashamed : and all the people rejo@@ iced for all the glorious things that were done by him .
it is like a grain of mu@@ st@@ ard seed , which a man took , and cast into his garden ; and it grew , and wa@@ xed a great tree ; and the f@@ ow@@ ls of the air lodged in the branches of it .
then said one unto him , Lord , are there few that be saved ? and he said unto them ,
then shall ye begin to say , We have eaten and drunk in thy presence , and thou hast taught in our streets .
but he shall say , I tell you , I know you not wh@@ ence ye are ; depart from me , all ye workers of ini@@ qu@@ ity .
there shall be we@@ eping and gn@@ ashing of teeth , when ye shall see Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , and all the prophets , in the kingdom of God , and you yourselves thrust out .
the same day there came certain of the Pharis@@ ees , saying unto him , Get thee out , and depart hence : for Her@@ od will kill thee .
and he said unto them , Go ye , and tell that fox , Be@@ hold , I cast out dev@@ ils , and I do cures to day and to mor@@ row , and the third day I shall be perf@@ ected .
O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , which kill@@ est the prophets , and st@@ on@@ est them that are sent unto thee ; how often would I have gathered thy children together , as a hen do@@ th gather her bro@@ od under her wings , and ye would not !
behold , your house is left unto you des@@ ol@@ ate : and verily I say unto you , Y@@ e shall not see me , until the time come when ye shall say , Bless@@ ed is he that com@@ eth in the name of the Lord .
and Jesus answering sp@@ ake unto the lawyers and Pharis@@ ees , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sab@@ bath day ?
and answered them , saying , Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit , and will not strai@@ gh@@ tw@@ ay pull him out on the sab@@ bath day ?
when thou art bid@@ den of any man to a wedding , sit not down in the highest room ; lest a more hon@@ our@@ able man than thou be bid@@ den of him ;
and they all with one consent began to make excuse . the first said unto him , I have bought a piece of ground , and I must needs go and see it : I pray thee have me exc@@ used .
and another said , I have bought five y@@ oke of ox@@ en , and I go to prove them : I pray thee have me exc@@ used .
lest ha@@ ply , after he hath laid the foundation , and is not able to finish it , all that behold it begin to mo@@ ck him ,
or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sen@@ det@@ h an amb@@ ass@@ age , and desi@@ re@@ th conditions of peace .
it is neither fit for the land , nor yet for the dun@@ gh@@ ill ; but men cast it out . he that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
what man of you , having an hundred sheep , if he lose one of them , do@@ th not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness , and go after that which is lost , until he find it ?
and when he com@@ eth home , he call@@ eth together his friends and neighbours , saying unto them , Re@@ jo@@ ice with me ; for I have found my sheep which was lost .
either what woman having ten pieces of silver , if she lose one piece , do@@ th not light a candle , and sweep the house , and seek dilig@@ ently till she find it ?
likewise , I say unto you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repent@@ eth .
and the younger of them said to his father , Father , give me the portion of goods that fall@@ eth to me . and he divided unto them his living .
and not many days after the younger son gathered all together , and took his journey into a far country , and there wasted his substance with ri@@ ot@@ ous living .
and when he had spent all , there arose a mighty famine in that land ; and he began to be in want .
and when he came to himself , he said , How many hired servants of my father 's have bread enough and to spare , and I perish with hunger !
I will arise and go to my father , and will say unto him , Father , I have sin@@ ned against heaven , and before thee ,
and am no more worthy to be called thy son : make me as one of thy hired servants .
and he arose , and came to his father . but when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him , and had compassion , and ran , and fell on his neck , and kis@@ sed him .
and the son said unto him , Father , I have sin@@ ned against heaven , and in thy sight , and am no more worthy to be called thy son .
but the father said to his servants , B@@ ring forth the best robe , and put it on him ; and put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet :
and he said unto him , Th@@ y brother is come ; and thy father hath killed the fat@@ ted cal@@ f , because he hath received him safe and sound .
and he answering said to his father , L@@ o , these many years do I serve thee , neither trans@@ g@@ ressed I at any time thy commandment : and yet thou never g@@ av@@ est me a kid , that I might make mer@@ ry with my friends :
but as soon as this thy son was come , which hath dev@@ oured thy living with har@@ lots , thou hast killed for him the fat@@ ted cal@@ f .
and he said also unto his disciples , There was a certain rich man , which had a ste@@ ward ; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods .
and he called him , and said unto him , How is it that I hear this of thee ? give an account of thy stewardship ; for thou may@@ est be no longer ste@@ ward .
then the ste@@ ward said within himself , What shall I do ? for my lord tak@@ eth away from me the stewardship : I C@@ AN@@ NOT dig ; to beg I am ashamed .
I am resolved what to do , that , when I am put out of the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses .
so he called every one of his lord 's debtors unto him , and said unto the first , How much ow@@ est thou unto my lord ?
and he said , An hundred measures of oil . and he said unto him , Take thy bill , and sit down quickly , and write fifty .
then said he to another , And how much ow@@ est thou ? and he said , An hundred measures of wheat . and he said unto him , Take thy bill , and write four@@ score .
and I say unto you , Make to yourselves friends of the mamm@@ on of un@@ righteousness ; that , when ye fail , they may receive you into everlasting hab@@ itations .
no servant can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and desp@@ ise the other . ye C@@ AN@@ NOT serve God and mamm@@ on .
and he said unto them , Y@@ e are they which justify yourselves before men ; but God know@@ eth your hearts : for that which is highly este@@ em@@ ed among men is ab@@ om@@ ination in the sight of God .
the law and the prophets were until John : since that time the kingdom of God is preached , and every man pres@@ set@@ h into it .
there was a certain rich man , which was clo@@ thed in purple and fine linen , and fa@@ red su@@ mp@@ tu@@ ously every day :
and desi@@ ring to be fed with the crum@@ bs which fell from the rich man 's table : moreover the dogs came and lic@@ ked his so@@ res .
and he cried and said , Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Laz@@ ar@@ us , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue ; for I am tor@@ m@@ ented in this flame .
and beside all this , between us and you there is a great gul@@ f fixed : so that they which would pass from hence to you C@@ AN@@ NOT ; neither can they pass to us , that would come from th@@ ence .
then said he unto the disciples , It is impossible but that offences will come : but w@@ oe unto him , through whom they come !
and if he t@@ resp@@ ass against thee seven times in a day , and seven times in a day turn again to thee , saying , I repent ; thou shalt forgive him .
but which of you , having a servant pl@@ owing or feeding cattle , will say unto him by and by , when he is come from the field , Go and sit down to meat ?
and will not rather say unto him , Make ready where@@ with I may su@@ p , and gir@@ d thy@@ self , and serve me , till I have eaten and drun@@ ken ; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink ?
so likewise ye , when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you , say , We are unprofitable servants : we have done that which was our duty to do .
and as he entered into a certain village , there met him ten men that were le@@ pers , which stood af@@ ar off :
and one of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , and with a loud voice glori@@ fied God ,
and fell down on his face at his feet , giving him thanks : and he was a Sam@@ ar@@ itan .
for as the lightning , that lighten@@ eth out of the one part under heaven , sh@@ in@@ eth unto the other part under heaven ; so shall also the Son of man be in his day .
they did eat , they drank , they married wives , they were given in marriage , until the day that No@@ e entered into the ark , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
in that day , he which shall be upon the hous@@ et@@ op , and his stuff in the house , let him not come down to take it away : and he that is in the field , let him likewise not return back .
two women shall be grinding together ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
and they answered and said unto him , Where , Lord ? and he said unto them , W@@ her@@ eso@@ ever the body is , thi@@ ther will the eag@@ les be gathered together .
two men went up into the temple to pray ; the one a Pharis@@ ee , and the other a public@@ an .
I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other : for every one that exal@@ t@@ eth himself shall be ab@@ ased ; and he that hum@@ bl@@ eth himself shall be exalted .
but Jesus called them unto him , and said , Su@@ ff@@ er little children to come unto me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of God .
thou know@@ est the commandments , Do not commit adul@@ tery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Hon@@ our thy father and thy mother .
now when Jesus heard these things , he said unto him , Y@@ et l@@ ack@@ est thou one thing : sell all that thou hast , and distribute unto the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , follow me .
and when Jesus saw that he was very sor@@ row@@ ful , he said , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !
and he said unto them , Ver@@ ily I say unto you , There is no man that hath left house , or parents , or brethren , or wife , or children , for the kingdom of God 's sake ,
then he took unto him the twelve , and said unto them , Be@@ hold , we go up to Jerusalem , and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished .
and they shall scourge him , and put him to death : and the third day he shall rise again .
and he cried , saying , Jesus , thou Son of David , have mercy on me .
and immediately he received his sight , and followed him , glori@@ fying God : and all the people , when they saw it , gave praise unto God .
and when Jesus came to the place , he looked up , and saw him , and said unto him , Z@@ acc@@ ha@@ eus , make ha@@ ste , and come down ; for to day I must abide at thy house .
and when they saw it , they all mur@@ mu@@ red , saying , That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner .
and Jesus said unto him , This day is salvation come to this house , for@@ som@@ uch as he also is a son of Abraham .
and as they heard these things , he added and sp@@ ake a parable , because he was ni@@ gh to Jerusalem , and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear .
and another came , saying , Lord , behold , here is thy pound , which I have kept laid up in a n@@ ap@@ kin :
for I feared thee , because thou art an au@@ st@@ ere man : thou tak@@ est up that thou lay@@ ed@@ st not down , and re@@ apest that thou did@@ st not sow .
and he sa@@ ith unto him , Out of th@@ ine own mouth will I judge thee , thou wicked servant . thou k@@ newest that I was an au@@ st@@ ere man , taking up that I laid not down , and re@@ aping that I did not sow :
saying , Go ye into the village over against you ; in the which at your entering ye shall find a col@@ t tied , where@@ on yet never man sat : loose him , and bring him hi@@ ther .
saying , Bless@@ ed be the King that com@@ eth in the name of the Lord : peace in heaven , and glory in the highest .
and he answered and said unto them , I tell you that , if these should hold their peace , the stones would immediately cry out .
and shall lay thee even with the ground , and thy children within thee ; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another ; because thou k@@ newest not the time of thy vis@@ itation .
saying unto them , It is written , My house is the house of prayer : but ye have made it a den of thieves .
and he taught daily in the temple . but the chief priests and the scri@@ bes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him ,
and sp@@ ake unto him , saying , Tell us , by what authority do@@ est thou these things ? or who is he that gave thee this authority ?
then began he to speak to the people this parable ; A certain man planted a viney@@ ard , and let it forth to Hus@@ band@@ men , and went into a far country for a long time .
and at the season he sent a servant to the Hus@@ band@@ men , that they should give him of the fruit of the viney@@ ard : but the Hus@@ band@@ men beat him , and sent him away empty .
then said the lord of the viney@@ ard , What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son : it may be they will reverence him when they see him .
but when the Hus@@ band@@ men saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , This is the heir : come , let us kill him , that the inheritance may be ours .
so they cast him out of the viney@@ ard , and killed him . what therefore shall the lord of the viney@@ ard do unto them ?
he shall come and destroy these Hus@@ band@@ men , and shall give the viney@@ ard to others . and when they heard it , they said , God forbid .
and he be@@ held them , and said , What is this then that is written , The stone which the builders rejected , the same is become the head of the corner ?
and the chief priests and the scri@@ bes the same hour sought to lay hands on him ; and they feared the people : for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them .
and they watched him , and sent forth spies , which should fe@@ ign themselves just men , that they might take hold of his words , that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor .
and they asked him , saying , Master , we know that thou say@@ est and teach@@ est rightly , neither accept@@ est thou the person of any , but teach@@ est the way of God truly :
and they could not take hold of his words before the people : and they marv@@ elled at his answer , and held their peace .
saying , Master , Moses wrote unto us , If any man 's brother die , having a wife , and he die without children , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
there were therefore seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and died without children .
and the third took her ; and in like manner the seven also : and they left no children , and died .
and Jesus answering said unto them , The children of this world marry , and are given in marriage :
and David himself sa@@ ith in the book of Psal@@ ms , The LORD said unto my Lord , S@@ it thou on my right hand ,
beware of the scri@@ bes , which desire to walk in long robes , and love greetings in the markets , and the highest seats in the syn@@ agogues , and the chief rooms at fe@@ asts ;
which dev@@ our wid@@ ows ' houses , and for a sh@@ ew make long prayers : the same shall receive greater dam@@ nation .
for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God : but she of her pen@@ ury hath cast in all the living that she had .
as for these things which ye behold , the days will come , in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
and they asked him , saying , Master , but when shall these things be ? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass ?
but when ye shall hear of wars and com@@ motions , be not terrified : for these things must first come to pass ; but the end is not by and by .
and great earthquakes shall be in divers places , and fam@@ ines , and PE@@ ST@@ IL@@ EN@@ CES ; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven .
but before all these , they shall lay their hands on you , and persec@@ ute you , delivering you up to the syn@@ agogues , and into prisons , being brought before kings and rulers for my name 's sake .
then let them which are in Juda@@ ea flee to the mountains ; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out ; and let not them that are in the countries enter there@@ into .
and when these things begin to come to pass , then look up , and lift up your heads ; for your redemption draw@@ eth ni@@ gh .
and take heed to yourselves , lest at any time your hearts be over@@ charged with sur@@ fe@@ iting , and drun@@ ken@@ ness , and cares of this life , and so that day come upon you un@@ awa@@ res .
and he went his way , and commun@@ ed with the chief priests and cap@@ tains , how he might betray him unto them .
and he said unto them , Be@@ hold , when ye are entered into the city , there shall a man meet you , bearing a p@@ itch@@ er of water ; follow him into the house where he enter@@ eth in .
and ye shall say unto the good@@ man of the house , The Master sa@@ ith unto thee , Where is the guest@@ chamber , where I shall eat the pas@@ sover with my disciples ?
for I say unto you , I will not any more eat thereof , until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God .
and he took bread , and gave thanks , and brake it , and gave unto them , saying , This is my body which is given for you : this do in rem@@ embrance of me .
and truly the Son of man go@@ eth , as it was determined : but w@@ oe unto that man by whom he is betrayed !
and the Lord said , Simon , Simon , behold , Satan hath desired to have you , that he may si@@ ft you as wheat :
then said he unto them , But now , he that hath a pur@@ se , let him take it , and likewise his scri@@ p : and he that hath no sword , let him sell his garment , and buy one .
for I say unto you , that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me , And he was reck@@ oned among the trans@@ gres@@ sors : for the things concerning me have an end .
and he came out , and went , as he was won@@ t , to the mount of O@@ lives ; and his disciples also followed him .
and when he rose up from prayer , and was come to his disciples , he found them sleeping for sorrow ,
then Jesus said unto the chief priests , and cap@@ tains of the temple , and the elders , which were come to him , Be ye come out , as against a thief , with s@@ words and st@@ aves ?
but a certain maid be@@ held him as he sat by the fire , and ear@@ ne@@ stly looked upon him , and said , This man was also with him .
and about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed , saying , Of a truth this fellow also was with him : for he is a Gal@@ il@@ a@@ ean .
and the Lord turned , and looked upon Peter . and Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how he had said unto him , Before the cock c@@ row , thou shalt deny me thr@@ ice .
then said they all , Art thou then the Son of God ? and he said unto them , Y@@ e say that I am .
and they began to accuse him , saying , We found this fellow perver@@ ting the nation , and forbid@@ ding to give tribute to Caes@@ ar , saying that he himself is Christ a King .
and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Her@@ od 's jurisdiction , he sent him to Her@@ od , who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time .
and when Her@@ od saw Jesus , he was exceeding glad : for he was desir@@ ous to see him of a long season , because he had heard many things of him ; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him .
and Her@@ od with his men of war set him at n@@ ought , and mo@@ cked him , and ar@@ ra@@ yed him in a gorgeous robe , and sent him again to Pil@@ ate .
said unto them , Y@@ e have brought this man unto me , as one that perver@@ t@@ eth the people : and , behold , I , having examined him before you , have found no fault in this man touching those things where@@ of ye accuse him :
no , nor yet Her@@ od : for I sent you to him ; and , lo , nothing worthy of death is done unto him .
and they cried out all at once , saying , A@@ way with this man , and release unto us Bar@@ ab@@ bas :
and he said unto them the third time , Why , what evil hath he done ? I have found no cause of death in him : I will therefore ch@@ as@@ tise him , and let him go .
and they were instant with loud voices , requiring that he might be cruci@@ fied . and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed .
and he released unto them him that for se@@ dition and murder was cast into prison , whom they had desired ; but he delivered Jesus to their will .
then shall they begin to say to the mountains , Fall on us ; and to the hills , C@@ over us .
and when they were come to the place , which is called Cal@@ vary , there they cruci@@ fied him , and the mal@@ e@@ factors , one on the right hand , and the other on the left .
and a su@@ pers@@ cription also was written over him in letters of Greek , and Latin , and Hebrew , TH@@ IS IS THE K@@ ING OF THE J@@ E@@ WS .
and one of the mal@@ e@@ factors which were han@@ ged rail@@ ed on him , saying , If thou be Christ , save thy@@ self and us .
and the sun was dark@@ ened , and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst .
and when Jesus had cried with a loud voice , he said , Father , into thy hands I comm@@ end my spirit : and having said thus , he gave up the ghost .
now when the cent@@ ur@@ ion saw what was done , he glori@@ fied God , saying , Cer@@ tain@@ ly this was a righteous man .
and all the people that came together to that sight , be@@ holding the things which were done , smo@@ te their breasts , and returned .
and he took it down , and wrapped it in linen , and laid it in a se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re that was he@@ wn in stone , where@@ in never man before was laid .
and the women also , which came with him from Gal@@ ilee , followed after , and be@@ held the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , and how his body was laid .
now upon the first day of the week , very early in the morning , they came unto the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , bringing the spices which they had prepared , and certain others with them .
and as they were afraid , and bowed down their faces to the earth , they said unto them , Why seek ye the living among the dead ?
and returned from the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , and told all these things unto the eleven , and to all the rest .
then arose Peter , and ran unto the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re ; and sto@@ oping down , he be@@ held the linen clothes laid by themselves , and departed , wondering in himself at that which was come to pass .
and it came to pass , that , while they commun@@ ed together and reasoned , Jesus himself drew near , and went with them .
and he said unto them , What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another , as ye walk , and are sad ?
and the one of them , whose name was Cle@@ op@@ as , answering said unto him , Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem , and hast not known the things which are come to pass therein these days ?
and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death , and have cruci@@ fied him .
ye@@ a , and certain women also of our company made us astonished , which were early at the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re ;
and certain of them which were with us went to the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , and found it even so as the women had said : but him they saw not .
but they constrained him , saying , A@@ bi@@ de with us : for it is toward evening , and the day is far spent . and he went in to tar@@ ry with them .
and they rose up the same hour , and returned to Jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and them that were with them ,
and said unto them , Th@@ us it is written , and thus it beh@@ oved Christ to suffer , and to rise from the dead the third day :
and , behold , I send the promise of my Father upon you : but tar@@ ry ye in the city of Jerusalem , until ye be endu@@ ed with power from on high .
the same came for a witness , to bear witness of the Light , that all men through him might believe .
which were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
and the Word was made flesh , and d@@ wel@@ t among us , ( and we be@@ held his glory , the glory as of the only be@@ gotten of the Father , ) full of grace and truth .
and this is the record of John , when the Jews sent priests and Lev@@ ites from Jerusalem to ask him , Who art thou ?
and they asked him , What then ? art thou Eli@@ as ? and he sa@@ ith , I am not . art thou that prophet ? and he answered , No .
then said they unto him , Who art thou ? that we may give an answer to them that sent us . what say@@ est thou of thy@@ self ?
and they asked him , and said unto him , Why bap@@ tiz@@ est thou then , if thou be not that Christ , nor Eli@@ as , neither that prophet ?
the next day John se@@ eth Jesus coming unto him , and sa@@ ith , Be@@ hold the Lam@@ b of God , which tak@@ eth away the sin of the world .
and I knew him not : but that he should be made manifest to Israel , therefore am I come bap@@ tizing with water .
then Jesus turned , and saw them following , and sa@@ ith unto them , What seek ye ? they said unto him , Rabbi , ( which is to say , being interpreted , Master , ) where dwell@@ est thou ?
he first fin@@ det@@ h his own brother Simon , and sa@@ ith unto him , We have found the Messi@@ as , which is , being interpreted , the Christ .
and he brought him to Jesus . and when Jesus be@@ held him , he said , Th@@ ou art Simon the son of J@@ ona : thou shalt be called C@@ ep@@ has , which is by interpretation , A stone .
Philip fin@@ det@@ h N@@ ath@@ an@@ ael , and sa@@ ith unto him , We have found him , of whom Moses in the law , and the prophets , did write , Jesus of Naz@@ areth , the son of Joseph .
Jesus answered and said unto him , Because I said unto thee , I saw thee under the fi@@ g tree , Beli@@ ev@@ est thou ? thou shalt see greater things than these .
and he sa@@ ith unto him , Ver@@ ily , verily , I say unto you , Her@@ e@@ after ye shall see heaven open , and the angels of God asc@@ ending and descending upon the Son of man .
and the third day there was a marriage in Can@@ a of Gal@@ ilee ; and the mother of Jesus was there :
and there were set there six water@@ pots of stone , after the manner of the puri@@ fying of the Jews , containing two or three fir@@ kins api@@ ece .
Jesus sa@@ ith unto them , F@@ ill the water@@ pots with water . and they filled them up to the bri@@ m .
when the ruler of the feast had t@@ asted the water that was made wine , and knew not wh@@ ence it was : ( but the servants which drew the water knew ; ) the governor of the feast called the bri@@ deg@@ room ,
and when he had made a scourge of small cor@@ ds , he drove them all out of the temple , and the sheep , and the ox@@ en ; and poured out the chang@@ ers ' money , and over@@ threw the tables ;
and said unto them that sold d@@ oves , Take these things hence ; make not my Father 's house an house of merchandise .
then answered the Jews and said unto him , What sign sh@@ ew@@ est thou unto us , seeing that thou do@@ est these things ?
when therefore he was risen from the dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them ; and they believed the scrip@@ ture , and the word which Jesus had said .
now when he was in Jerusalem at the pas@@ sover , in the feast day , many believed in his name , when they saw the miracles which he did .
Jesus answered and said unto him , Ver@@ ily , verily , I say unto thee , Exc@@ ept a man be born again , he C@@ AN@@ NOT see the kingdom of God .
Nic@@ o@@ dem@@ us sa@@ ith unto him , How can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter the second time into his mother 's womb , and be born ?
Jesus answered , Ver@@ ily , verily , I say unto thee , Exc@@ ept a man be born of water and of the Spirit , he C@@ AN@@ NOT enter into the kingdom of God .
the wind blow@@ eth where it list@@ eth , and thou he@@ arest the sound thereof , but can@@ st not tell wh@@ ence it com@@ eth , and whi@@ ther it go@@ eth : so is every one that is born of the Spirit .
and no man hath asc@@ ended up to heaven , but he that came down from heaven , even the Son of man which is in heaven .
and as Moses lifted up the ser@@ pent in the wilderness , even so must the Son of man be lifted up :
after these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Juda@@ ea ; and there he tar@@ ried with them , and baptized .
and they came unto John , and said unto him , Rabbi , he that was with thee beyond Jordan , to whom thou ba@@ rest witness , behold , the same bap@@ tiz@@ eth , and all men come to him .
he that hath the bride is the bri@@ deg@@ room : but the friend of the bri@@ deg@@ room , which stand@@ eth and he@@ areth him , rejo@@ ic@@ eth greatly because of the bri@@ deg@@ room 's voice : this my joy therefore is fulfilled .
he that believ@@ eth on the Son hath everlasting life : and he that believ@@ eth not the Son shall not see life ; but the wrath of God ab@@ id@@ eth on him .
then com@@ eth he to a city of Sam@@ aria , which is called Sy@@ cha@@ r , near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
now Jacob 's well was there . Jesus therefore , being wear@@ ied with his journey , sat thus on the well : and it was about the sixth hour .
there com@@ eth a woman of Sam@@ aria to draw water : Jesus sa@@ ith unto her , Gi@@ ve me to drink .
Jesus answered and said unto her , If thou k@@ newest the gift of God , and who it is that sa@@ ith to thee , Gi@@ ve me to drink ; thou w@@ oul@@ dest have asked of him , and he would have given thee living water .
the woman sa@@ ith unto him , Sir , thou hast nothing to draw with , and the well is deep : from wh@@ ence then hast thou that living water ?
Jesus sa@@ ith unto her , Woman , believe me , the hour com@@ eth , when ye shall neither in this mountain , nor yet at Jerusalem , worship the Father .
but the hour com@@ eth , and now is , when the true worshi@@ ppers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth : for the Father see@@ ket@@ h such to worship him .
the woman sa@@ ith unto him , I know that Messi@@ as com@@ eth , which is called Christ : when he is come , he will tell us all things .
the woman then left her water@@ pot , and went her way into the city , and sa@@ ith to the men ,
Jesus sa@@ ith unto them , My meat is to do the will of him that sent me , and to finish his work .
and he that re@@ ap@@ eth recei@@ v@@ eth wages , and gather@@ eth fruit unto life eternal : that both he that s@@ ow@@ eth and he that re@@ ap@@ eth may rejoice together .
and many of the Sam@@ ar@@ it@@ ans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman , which testified , He told me all that ever I did .
and said unto the woman , Now we believe , not because of thy saying : for we have heard him ourselves , and know that this is indeed the Christ , the Saviour of the world .
when he heard that Jesus was come out of Juda@@ ea into Gal@@ ilee , he went unto him , and bes@@ ought him that he would come down , and heal his son : for he was at the point of death .
Jesus sa@@ ith unto him , Go thy way ; thy son liv@@ eth . and the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him , and he went his way .
then inqui@@ red he of them the hour when he began to amend . and they said unto him , Y@@ ester@@ day at the seventh hour the fever left him .
in these lay a great multitude of im@@ potent folk , of blind , halt , with@@ ered , waiting for the moving of the water .
for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool , and troubled the water : wh@@ oso@@ ever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had .
when Jesus saw him lie , and knew that he had been now a long time in that case , he sa@@ ith unto him , Wil@@ t thou be made whole ?
and immediately the man was made whole , and took up his bed , and walked : and on the same day was the sab@@ bath .
he answered them , He that made me whole , the same said unto me , Take up thy bed , and walk .
and he that was healed w@@ ist not who it was : for Jesus had conveyed himself away , a multitude being in that place .
then answered Jesus and said unto them , Ver@@ ily , verily , I say unto you , The Son can do nothing of himself , but what he se@@ eth the Father do : for what things soever he do@@ eth , these also do@@ eth the Son likewise .
for the Father lov@@ eth the Son , and sh@@ ew@@ eth him all things that himself do@@ eth : and he will sh@@ ew him greater works than these , that ye may mar@@ vel .
that all men should honour the Son , even as they honour the Father . he that hon@@ ou@@ re@@ th not the Son hon@@ ou@@ re@@ th not the Father which hath sent him .
verily , verily , I say unto you , He that he@@ areth my word , and believ@@ eth on him that sent me , hath everlasting life , and shall not come into condemnation ; but is passed from death unto life .
I can of mine own self do nothing : as I hear , I judge : and my judgment is just ; because I seek not mine own will , but the will of the Father which hath sent me .
but I have greater witness than that of John : for the works which the Father hath given me to finish , the same works that I do , bear witness of me , that the Father hath sent me .
and the Father himself , which hath sent me , hath borne witness of me . ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his shape .
when Jesus then lifted up his eyes , and saw a great company come unto him , he sa@@ ith unto Philip , wh@@ ence shall we buy bread , that these may eat ?
there is a l@@ ad here , which hath five barley lo@@ aves , and two small f@@ ishes : but what are they among so many ?
and Jesus said , Make the men sit down . now there was much grass in the place . so the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
therefore they gathered them together , and filled twelve bas@@ kets with the fragments of the five barley lo@@ aves , which remained over and above unto them that had eaten .
then those men , when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did , said , This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world .
when Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force , to make him a king , he departed again into a mountain himself alone .
so when they had row@@ ed about five and twenty or thirty fur@@ l@@ ongs , they see Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing ni@@ gh unto the ship : and they were afraid .
and when they had found him on the other side of the sea , they said unto him , Rabbi , when cam@@ est thou hi@@ ther ?
Jesus answered them and said , Ver@@ ily , verily , I say unto you , Y@@ e seek me , not because ye saw the miracles , but because ye did eat of the lo@@ aves , and were filled .
our fathers did eat man@@ na in the desert ; as it is written , He gave them bread from heaven to eat .
then Jesus said unto them , Ver@@ ily , verily , I say unto you , Moses gave you not that bread from heaven ; but my Father gi@@ v@@ eth you the true bread from heaven .
and Jesus said unto them , I am the bread of life : he that com@@ eth to me shall never hunger ; and he that believ@@ eth on me shall never thirst .
and this is the Father 's will which hath sent me , that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up again at the last day .
and this is the will of him that sent me , that every one which se@@ eth the Son , and believ@@ eth on him , may have everlasting life : and I will raise him up at the last day .
and they said , Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? how is it then that he sa@@ ith , I came down from heaven ?
this is the bread which com@@ eth down from heaven , that a man may eat thereof , and not die .
I am the living bread which came down from heaven : if any man eat of this bread , he shall live for ever : and the bread that I will give is my flesh , which I will give for the life of the world .
then Jesus said unto them , Ver@@ ily , verily , I say unto you , Exc@@ ept ye eat the flesh of the Son of man , and drink his blood , ye have no life in you .
as the living Father hath sent me , and I live by the Father : so he that e@@ at@@ eth me , even he shall live by me .
many therefore of his disciples , when they had heard this , said , This is an hard saying ; who can hear it ?
it is the spirit that quick@@ en@@ eth ; the flesh prof@@ it@@ eth nothing : the words that I speak unto you , they are spirit , and they are life .
but there are some of you that believe not . for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not , and who should betray him .
he sp@@ ake of Jud@@ as Is@@ c@@ ari@@ ot the son of Simon : for he it was that should betray him , being one of the twelve .
for there is no man that do@@ eth any thing in secret , and he himself see@@ ket@@ h to be known openly . if thou do these things , sh@@ ew thy@@ self to the world .
but when his brethren were gone up , then went he also up unto the feast , not openly , but as it were in secret .
and there was much mur@@ m@@ uring among the people concerning him : for some said , He is a good man : others said , N@@ ay ; but he decei@@ v@@ eth the people .
he that spe@@ ak@@ eth of himself see@@ ket@@ h his own glory : but he that see@@ ket@@ h his glory that sent him , the same is true , and no un@@ righteousness is in him .
Moses therefore gave unto you circum@@ cision ; ( not because it is of Moses , but of the fathers ; ) and ye on the sab@@ bath day circum@@ c@@ ise a man .
if a man on the sab@@ bath day receive circum@@ cision , that the law of Moses should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because I have made a man every wh@@ it whole on the sab@@ bath day ?
then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught , saying , Y@@ e both know me , and ye know wh@@ ence I am : and I am not come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye know not .
the Pharis@@ ees heard that the people mur@@ mu@@ red such things concerning him ; and the Pharis@@ ees and the chief priests sent officers to take him .
then said Jesus unto them , Y@@ et a little while am I with you , and then I go unto him that sent me .
( but this sp@@ ake he of the Spirit , which they that believe on him should receive : for the Holy Ghost was not yet given ; because that Jesus was not yet glori@@ fied . )
and early in the morning he came again into the temple , and all the people came unto him ; and he sat down , and taught them .
so when they continued asking him , he lifted up himself , and said unto them , He that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at her .
and they which heard it , being convicted by their own conscience , went out one by one , beginning at the el@@ dest , even unto the last : and Jesus was left alone , and the woman standing in the midst .
when Jesus had lifted up himself , and saw none but the woman , he said unto her , Woman , where are those th@@ ine acc@@ users ? hath no man condemned thee ?
these words sp@@ ake Jesus in the treasury , as he taught in the temple : and no man laid hands on him ; for his hour was not yet come .
and he said unto them , Y@@ e are from beneath ; I am from above : ye are of this world ; I am not of this world .
then said they unto him , Who art thou ? and Jesus sa@@ ith unto them , Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning .
I have many things to say and to judge of you : but he that sent me is true ; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him .
then said Jesus unto them , When ye have lifted up the Son of man , then shall ye know that I am he , and that I do nothing of myself ; but as my Father hath taught me , I speak these things .
and he that sent me is with me : the Father hath not left me alone ; for I do always those things that please him .
they answered him , We be Abraham 's seed , and were never in bond@@ age to any man : how say@@ est thou , Y@@ e shall be made free ?
they answered and said unto him , Abraham is our father . Jesus sa@@ ith unto them , If ye were Abraham 's children , ye would do the works of Abraham .
but now ye seek to kill me , a man that hath told you the truth , which I have heard of God : this did not Abraham .
ye do the deeds of your father . then said they to him , We be not born of for@@ n@@ ication ; we have one Father , even God .
then said the Jews unto him , Now we know that thou hast a devil . Abraham is dead , and the prophets ; and thou say@@ est , If a man keep my saying , he shall never taste of death .
yet ye have not known him ; but I know him : and if I should say , I know him not , I shall be a li@@ ar like unto you : but I know him , and keep his saying .
then took they up stones to cast at him : but Jesus hid himself , and went out of the temple , going through the midst of them , and so passed by .
and his disciples asked him , saying , Master , who did sin , this man , or his parents , that he was born blind ?
I must work the works of him that sent me , while it is day : the night com@@ eth , when no man can work .
and said unto him , Go , wash in the pool of Sil@@ o@@ am , ( which is by interpretation , S@@ ent . ) He went his way therefore , and washed , and came seeing .
he answered and said , A man that is called Jesus made clay , and ano@@ inted mine eyes , and said unto me , Go to the pool of Sil@@ o@@ am , and wash : and I went and washed , and I received sight .
then again the Pharis@@ ees also asked him how he had received his sight . he said unto them , He put clay upon mine eyes , and I washed , and do see .
therefore said some of the Pharis@@ ees , This man is not of God , because he keep@@ eth not the sab@@ bath day . others said , How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles ? and there was a division among them .
they say unto the blind man again , What say@@ est thou of him , that he hath opened th@@ ine eyes ? he said , He is a prophet .
these words sp@@ ake his parents , because they feared the Jews : for the Jews had agreed already , that if any man did confess that he was Christ , he should be put out of the synagogue .
he answered and said , Whe@@ ther he be a sinner or no , I know not : one thing I know , that , whereas I was blind , now I see .
the man answered and said unto them , Why herein is a marv@@ ell@@ ous thing , that ye know not from wh@@ ence he is , and yet he hath opened mine eyes .
now we know that God he@@ areth not sinners : but if any man be a wor@@ ship@@ per of God , and do@@ eth his will , him he he@@ areth .
Jesus heard that they had cast him out ; and when he had found him , he said unto him , D@@ ost thou believe on the Son of God ?
and Jesus said unto him , Th@@ ou hast both seen him , and it is he that tal@@ ket@@ h with thee .
and Jesus said , For judgment I am come into this world , that they which see not might see ; and that they which see might be made blind .
to him the porter open@@ eth ; and the sheep hear his voice : and he call@@ eth his own sheep by name , and lead@@ eth them out .
then said Jesus unto them again , Ver@@ ily , verily , I say unto you , I am the door of the sheep .
I am the door : by me if any man enter in , he shall be saved , and shall go in and out , and find past@@ ure .
the thief com@@ eth not , but for to steal , and to kill , and to destroy : I am come that they might have life , and that they might have it more ab@@ und@@ antly .
but he that is an hi@@ rel@@ ing , and not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , se@@ eth the wolf coming , and leav@@ eth the sheep , and fle@@ eth : and the wolf cat@@ ch@@ eth them , and sc@@ atter@@ eth the sheep .
no man tak@@ eth it from me , but I lay it down of myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . this commandment have I received of my Father .
then came the Jews round about him , and said unto him , How long d@@ ost thou make us to doubt ? if thou be the Christ , tell us plainly .
my Father , which gave them me , is greater than all ; and no man is able to pl@@ uck them out of my Father 's hand .
say ye of him , whom the Father hath sancti@@ fied , and sent into the world , Th@@ ou bl@@ asph@@ em@@ est ; because I said , I am the Son of God ?
but if I do , though ye believe not me , believe the works : that ye may know , and believe , that the Father is in me , and I in him .
when Jesus heard that , he said , This sickness is not unto death , but for the glory of God , that the Son of God might be glori@@ fied thereby .
Jesus answered , Are there not twelve hours in the day ? if any man walk in the day , he stum@@ bl@@ eth not , because he se@@ eth the light of this world .
but if a man walk in the night , he stum@@ bl@@ eth , because there is no light in him .
and I am glad for your s@@ akes that I was not there , to the intent ye may believe ; nevertheless let us go unto him .
then said Thomas , which is called D@@ id@@ ym@@ us , unto his fel@@ low@@ disciples , Let us also go , that we may die with him .
Jesus said unto her , I am the resurrection , and the life : he that believ@@ eth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live :
she sa@@ ith unto him , Y@@ ea , Lord : I believe that thou art the Christ , the Son of God , which should come into the world .
when Jesus therefore saw her we@@ eping , and the Jews also we@@ eping which came with her , he gro@@ an@@ ed in the spirit , and was troubled ,
and some of them said , Could not this man , which opened the eyes of the blind , have caused that even this man should not have died ?
Jesus said , Take ye away the stone . Mar@@ tha , the sister of him that was dead , sa@@ ith unto him , Lord , by this time he st@@ in@@ ket@@ h : for he hath been dead four days .
Jesus sa@@ ith unto her , S@@ aid I not unto thee , that , if thou w@@ oul@@ dest believe , thou shoul@@ dest see the glory of God ?
then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid . and Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , Father , I thank thee that thou hast heard me .
and he that was dead came forth , bound hand and foot with grav@@ ec@@ lo@@ thes : and his face was bound about with a n@@ ap@@ kin . Jesus sa@@ ith unto them , Lo@@ ose him , and let him go .
then gathered the chief priests and the Pharis@@ ees a council , and said , What do we ? for this man do@@ eth many miracles .
now both the chief priests and the Pharis@@ ees had given a commandment , that , if any man knew where he were , he should sh@@ ew it , that they might take him .
there they made him a sup@@ per ; and Mar@@ tha served : but Laz@@ ar@@ us was one of them that sat at the table with him .
then took Mary a pound of o@@ int@@ ment of sp@@ ik@@ en@@ ard , very costly , and ano@@ inted the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair : and the house was filled with the od@@ our of the o@@ int@@ ment .
much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there : and they came not for Jesus ' sake only , but that they might see Laz@@ ar@@ us also , whom he had raised from the dead .
these things understood not his disciples at the first : but when Jesus was glori@@ fied , then remembered they that these things were written of him , and that they had done these things unto him .
verily , verily , I say unto you , Exc@@ ept a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die , it ab@@ id@@ eth alone : but if it die , it br@@ ing@@ eth forth much fruit .
he that lov@@ eth his life shall lose it ; and he that hat@@ eth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal .
if any man serve me , let him follow me ; and where I am , there shall also my servant be : if any man serve me , him will my Father honour .
the people therefore , that stood by , and heard it , said that it thunder@@ ed : others said , An angel sp@@ ake to him .
now is the judgment of this world : now shall the prince of this world be cast out .
the people answered him , We have heard out of the law that Christ ab@@ id@@ eth for ever : and how say@@ est thou , The Son of man must be lifted up ? who is this Son of man ?
then Jesus said unto them , Y@@ et a little while is the light with you . walk while ye have the light , lest darkness come upon you : for he that wal@@ ket@@ h in darkness know@@ eth not whi@@ ther he go@@ eth .
while ye have light , believe in the light , that ye may be the children of light . these things sp@@ ake Jesus , and departed , and did hide himself from them .
he hath blin@@ ded their eyes , and hardened their heart ; that they should not see with their eyes , nor understand with their heart , and be converted , and I should heal them .
nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him ; but because of the Pharis@@ ees they did not confess him , lest they should be put out of the synagogue :
and if any man hear my words , and believe not , I judge him not : for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
he that rej@@ ec@@ t@@ eth me , and recei@@ v@@ eth not my words , hath one that jud@@ get@@ h him : the word that I have spoken , the same shall judge him in the last day .
for I have not spoken of myself ; but the Father which sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
now before the feast of the pas@@ sover , when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father , having loved his own which were in the world , he loved them unto the end .
and sup@@ per being ended , the devil having now put into the heart of Jud@@ as Is@@ c@@ ari@@ ot , Simon 's son , to betray him ;
Jesus sa@@ ith to him , He that is washed need@@ eth not save to wash his feet , but is clean every wh@@ it : and ye are clean , but not all .
so after he had washed their feet , and had taken his garments , and was set down again , he said unto them , Know ye what I have done to you ?
I speak not of you all : I know whom I have chosen : but that the scrip@@ ture may be fulfilled , He that e@@ at@@ eth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me .
verily , verily , I say unto you , He that recei@@ v@@ eth wh@@ om@@ soever I send recei@@ v@@ eth me ; and he that recei@@ v@@ eth me recei@@ v@@ eth him that sent me .
when Jesus had thus said , he was troubled in spirit , and testified , and said , Ver@@ ily , verily , I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
for some of them thought , because Jud@@ as had the bag , that Jesus had said unto him , Buy those things that we have need of against the feast ; or , that he should give something to the poor .
therefore , when he was gone out , Jesus said , Now is the Son of man glori@@ fied , and God is glori@@ fied in him .
Jesus answered him , Wil@@ t thou lay down thy life for my sake ? verily , verily , I say unto thee , The cock shall not c@@ row , till thou hast denied me thr@@ ice .
in my Father 's house are many man@@ sions : if it were not so , I would have told you . I go to prepare a place for you .
and if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and receive you unto myself ; that where I am , there ye may be also .
Jesus sa@@ ith unto him , Have I been so long time with you , and yet hast thou not known me , Philip ? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father ; and how say@@ est thou then , sh@@ ew us the Father ?
Beli@@ ev@@ est thou not that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself : but the Father that dwell@@ eth in me , he do@@ eth the works .
verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believ@@ eth on me , the works that I do shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall he do ; because I go unto my Father .
and I will pray the Father , and he shall give you another Com@@ for@@ ter , that he may abide with you for ever ;
even the Spirit of truth ; whom the world C@@ AN@@ NOT receive , because it se@@ eth him not , neither know@@ eth him : but ye know him ; for he dwell@@ eth with you , and shall be in you .
he that hath my commandments , and keep@@ eth them , he it is that lov@@ eth me : and he that lov@@ eth me shall be loved of my Father , and I will love him , and will manifest myself to him .
Jesus answered and said unto him , If a man love me , he will keep my words : and my Father will love him , and we will come unto him , and make our ab@@ ode with him .
peace I leave with you , my peace I give unto you : not as the world gi@@ v@@ eth , give I unto you . let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid .
but that the world may know that I love the Father ; and as the Father gave me commandment , even so I do . arise , let us go hence .
every branch in me that be@@ areth not fruit he tak@@ eth away : and every branch that be@@ areth fruit , he pur@@ get@@ h it , that it may bring forth more fruit .
if a man abide not in me , he is cast forth as a branch , and is with@@ ered ; and men gather them , and cast them into the fire , and they are burned .
if ye keep my commandments , ye shall abide in my love ; even as I have kept my Father 's commandments , and abide in his love .
these things have I spoken unto you , that my joy might remain in you , and that your joy might be full .
h@@ ence@@ forth I call you not servants ; for the servant know@@ eth not what his lord do@@ eth : but I have called you friends ; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you .
ye have not chosen me , but I have chosen you , and ordained you , that ye should go and bring forth fruit , and that your fruit should remain : that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name , he may give it you .
if ye were of the world , the world would love his own : but because ye are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world hat@@ eth you .
remember the word that I said unto you , The servant is not greater than his lord . if they have persecuted me , they will also persec@@ ute you ; if they have kept my saying , they will keep yours also .
but all these things will they do unto you for my name 's sake , because they know not him that sent me .
but when the Com@@ for@@ ter is come , whom I will send unto you from the Father , even the Spirit of truth , which proce@@ ed@@ eth from the Father , he shall testify of me :
but these things have I told you , that when the time shall come , ye may remember that I told you of them . and these things I said not unto you at the beginning , because I was with you .
nevertheless I tell you the truth ; It is expedient for you that I go away : for if I go not away , the Com@@ for@@ ter will not come unto you ; but if I depart , I will send him unto you .
How@@ be@@ it when he , the Spirit of truth , is come , he will guide you into all truth : for he shall not speak of himself ; but whatsoever he shall hear , that shall he speak : and he will sh@@ ew you things to come .
all things that the Father hath are mine : therefore said I , that he shall take of mine , and shall sh@@ ew it unto you .
now Jesus knew that they were desir@@ ous to ask him , and said unto them , Do ye inqu@@ ire among yourselves of that I said , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me ?
verily , verily , I say unto you , That ye shall we@@ ep and lam@@ ent , but the world shall rejoice : and ye shall be sor@@ row@@ ful , but your sorrow shall be turned into joy .
a woman when she is in trav@@ ail hath sorrow , because her hour is come : but as soon as she is delivered of the child , she remem@@ ber@@ eth no more the angu@@ ish , for joy that a man is born into the world .
and in that day ye shall ask me nothing . verily , verily , I say unto you , whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name , he will give it you .
these things have I spoken unto you in prover@@ bs : but the time com@@ eth , when I shall no more speak unto you in prover@@ bs , but I shall sh@@ ew you plainly of the Father .
I came forth from the Father , and am come into the world : again , I leave the world , and go to the Father .
behold , the hour com@@ eth , ye@@ a , is now come , that ye shall be scattered , every man to his own , and shall leave me alone : and yet I am not alone , because the Father is with me .
these things I have spoken unto you , that in me ye might have peace . in the world ye shall have tribu@@ lation : but be of good che@@ er ; I have overcome the world .
these words sp@@ ake Jesus , and lifted up his eyes to heaven , and said , Father , the hour is come ; glori@@ fy thy Son , that thy Son also may glori@@ fy thee :
for I have given unto them the words which thou g@@ av@@ est me ; and they have received them , and have known surely that I came out from thee , and they have believed that thou did@@ st send me .
and now I am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I come to thee . Holy Father , keep through th@@ ine own name those whom thou hast given me , that they may be one , as we are .
I pray not that thou shoul@@ dest take them out of the world , but that thou shoul@@ dest keep them from the evil .
I in them , and thou in me , that they may be made perfect in one ; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me , and hast loved them , as thou hast loved me .
and I have declared unto them thy name , and will declare it : that the love where@@ with thou hast loved me may be in them , and I in them .
when Jesus had spoken these words , he went forth with his disciples over the bro@@ ok C@@ ed@@ ron , where was a garden , into the which he entered , and his disciples .
they answered him , Jesus of Naz@@ areth . Jesus sa@@ ith unto them , I am he . and Jud@@ as also , which betrayed him , stood with them .
then Simon Peter having a sword drew it , and smo@@ te the high priest 's servant , and cut off his right ear . the servant 's name was Mal@@ ch@@ us .
then said Jesus unto Peter , P@@ ut up thy sword into the she@@ ath : the cup which my Father hath given me , shall I not drink it ?
and led him away to Ann@@ as first ; for he was father in law to C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has , which was the high priest that same year .
and Simon Peter followed Jesus , and so did another disciple : that disciple was known unto the high priest , and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest .
but Peter stood at the door without . then went out that other disciple , which was known unto the high priest , and sp@@ ake unto her that kept the door , and brought in Peter .
then sa@@ ith the dam@@ sel that kept the door unto Peter , Art not thou also one of this man 's disciples ? he sa@@ ith , I am not .
and the servants and officers stood there , who had made a fire of co@@ als ; for it was cold : and they war@@ med themselves : and Peter stood with them , and war@@ med himself .
Jesus answered him , I sp@@ ake openly to the world ; I ever taught in the synagogue , and in the temple , whi@@ ther the Jews always resort ; and in secret have I said nothing .
and when he had thus spoken , one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand , saying , Answ@@ er@@ est thou the high priest so ?
and Simon Peter stood and war@@ med himself . they said therefore unto him , Art not thou also one of his disciples ? he denied it , and said , I am not .
one of the servants of the high priest , being his kin@@ sman whose ear Peter cut off , sa@@ ith , Did not I see thee in the garden with him ?
then led they Jesus from C@@ ai@@ ap@@ has unto the hall of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall , lest they should be de@@ filed ; but that they might eat the pas@@ sover .
then said Pil@@ ate unto them , Take ye him , and judge him according to your law . the Jews therefore said unto him , It is not lawful for us to put any man to death :
then Pil@@ ate entered into the judgment hall again , and called Jesus , and said unto him , Art thou the King of the Jews ?
Pil@@ ate answered , Am I a Jew ? th@@ ine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me : what hast thou done ?
Pil@@ ate therefore said unto him , Art thou a king then ? Jesus answered , Th@@ ou say@@ est that I am a king . to this end was I born , and for this cause came I into the world , that I should bear witness unto the truth . every one that is of the truth he@@ areth my voice .
Pil@@ ate sa@@ ith unto him , What is truth ? and when he had said this , he went out again unto the Jews , and sa@@ ith unto them , I find in him no fault at all .
but ye have a custom , that I should release unto you one at the pas@@ sover : will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews ?
and the soldiers plat@@ ted a crown of thor@@ ns , and put it on his head , and they put on him a purple robe ,
then came Jesus forth , wearing the crown of thor@@ ns , and the purple robe . and Pil@@ ate sa@@ ith unto them , Be@@ hold the man !
when the chief priests therefore and officers saw him , they cried out , saying , Cru@@ ci@@ fy him , cruci@@ fy him . Pil@@ ate sa@@ ith unto them , Take ye him , and cruci@@ fy him : for I find no fault in him .
and from th@@ ence@@ forth Pil@@ ate sought to release him : but the Jews cried out , saying , If thou let this man go , thou art not Caes@@ ar 's friend : wh@@ oso@@ ever mak@@ eth himself a king spe@@ ak@@ eth against Caes@@ ar .
when Pil@@ ate therefore heard that saying , he brought Jesus forth , and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pav@@ ement , but in the Hebrew , Gab@@ bath@@ a .
and it was the preparation of the pas@@ sover , and about the sixth hour : and he sa@@ ith unto the Jews , Be@@ hold your King !
but they cried out , A@@ way with him , away with him , cruci@@ fy him . Pil@@ ate sa@@ ith unto them , Sh@@ all I cruci@@ fy your King ? the chief priest answered , We have no king but Caes@@ ar .
and he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull , which is called in the Hebrew Gol@@ go@@ tha :
and Pil@@ ate wrote a title , and put it on the cross . and the writing was , J@@ ES@@ US OF Naz@@ areth THE K@@ ING OF THE J@@ E@@ WS .
then the soldiers , when they had cruci@@ fied Jesus , took his garments , and made four parts , to every soldier a part ; and also his coat : now the coat was without se@@ am , woven from the top throughout .
now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother 's sister , Mary the wife of Cle@@ op@@ has , and Mary Mag@@ dal@@ ene .
when Jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he loved , he sa@@ ith unto his mother , Woman , behold thy son !
now there was set a vessel full of vin@@ eg@@ ar : and they filled a sp@@ un@@ ge with vin@@ eg@@ ar , and put it upon h@@ ys@@ so@@ p , and put it to his mouth .
when Jesus therefore had received the vin@@ eg@@ ar , he said , It is finished : and he bowed his head , and gave up the ghost .
and he that saw it bare record , and his record is true : and he know@@ eth that he sa@@ ith true , that ye might believe .
and after this Joseph of Ari@@ ma@@ th@@ a@@ ea , being a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews , bes@@ ought Pil@@ ate that he might take away the body of Jesus : and Pil@@ ate gave him leave . he came therefore , and took the body of Jesus .
and he sto@@ oping down , and looking in , saw the linen clothes lying ; yet went he not in .
but Mary stood without at the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re we@@ eping : and as she we@@ pt , she sto@@ op@@ ed down , and looked into the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re ,
and they say unto her , Woman , why we@@ ep@@ est thou ? she sa@@ ith unto them , Because they have taken away my Lord , and I know not where they have laid him .
and when she had thus said , she turned herself back , and saw Jesus standing , and knew not that it was Jesus .
Jesus sa@@ ith unto her , Woman , why we@@ ep@@ est thou ? whom see@@ k@@ est thou ? she , sup@@ posing him to be the gar@@ den@@ er , sa@@ ith unto him , Sir , if thou have borne him hence , tell me where thou hast laid him , and I will take him away .
and after eight days again his disciples were within , and Thomas with them : then came Jesus , the doors being shut , and stood in the midst , and said , Peace be unto you .
then sa@@ ith he to Thomas , reach hi@@ ther thy finger , and behold my hands ; and reach hi@@ ther thy hand , and thrust it into my side : and be not faith@@ less , but believing .
Simon Peter sa@@ ith unto them , I go a fishing . they say unto him , We also go with thee . they went forth , and entered into a ship immediately ; and that night they caught nothing .
and he said unto them , C@@ ast the net on the right side of the ship , and ye shall find . they cast therefore , and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of f@@ ishes .
and the other disciples came in a little ship ; ( for they were not far from land , but as it were two hundred cub@@ its , ) dragging the net with f@@ ishes .
Simon Peter went up , and drew the net to land full of great f@@ ishes , and hundred and fifty and three : and for all there were so many , yet was not the net broken .
and there are also many other things which Jesus did , the which , if they should be written every one , I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written . A@@ men .
until the day in which he was taken up , after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen :
to whom also he sh@@ ew@@ ed himself alive after his passion by many inf@@ alli@@ ble proof@@ s , being seen of them forty days , and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God :
and , being assembled together with them , commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem , but wait for the promise of the Father , which , sa@@ ith he , ye have heard of me .
and he said unto them , It is not for you to know the times or the seasons , which the Father hath put in his own power .
but ye shall receive power , after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you : and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem , and in all Juda@@ ea , and in Sam@@ aria , and unto the utter@@ most part of the earth .
which also said , Y@@ e men of Gal@@ ilee , why stand ye gaz@@ ing up into heaven ? this same Jesus , which is taken up from you into heaven , shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven .
and when they were come in , they went up into an upper room , where ab@@ ode both Peter , and James , and John , and Andrew , Philip , and Thomas , Bar@@ th@@ ol@@ om@@ ew , and Matthew , James the son of Al@@ p@@ ha@@ eus , and Simon Zel@@ otes , and Jud@@ as the brother of James .
now this man purchased a field with the reward of ini@@ qu@@ ity ; and falling head@@ long , he burst as@@ under in the midst , and all his bow@@ els g@@ ushed out .
and it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem ; in@@ som@@ uch as that field is called in their proper tongue , Ac@@ el@@ dam@@ a , that is to say , The field of blood .
beginning from the baptism of John , unto that same day that he was taken up from us , must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection .
and they prayed , and said , Th@@ ou , Lord , which know@@ est the hearts of all men , sh@@ ew whether of these two thou hast chosen ,
that he may take part of this ministry and apost@@ les@@ hip , from which Jud@@ as by trans@@ g@@ ression fell , that he might go to his own place .
and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost , and began to speak with other tongues , as the Spirit gave them utter@@ ance .
now when this was no@@ ised abroad , the multitude came together , and were conf@@ ounded , because that every man heard them speak in his own language .
and they were all amazed and marv@@ elled , saying one to another , Be@@ hold , are not all these which speak Gal@@ il@@ a@@ e@@ ans ?
but Peter , standing up with the eleven , lifted up his voice , and said unto them , Y@@ e men of Juda@@ ea , and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem , be this known unto you , and hear@@ ken to my words :
for these are not drun@@ ken , as ye suppose , seeing it is but the third hour of the day .
and it shall come to pass in the last days , sa@@ ith God , I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh : and your sons and your daughters shall proph@@ esy , and your young men shall see visions , and your old men shall dream dreams :
and I will sh@@ ew wonders in heaven above , and signs in the earth beneath ; blood , and fire , and vap@@ our of smoke :
ye men of Israel , hear these words ; Jesus of Naz@@ areth , a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs , which God did by him in the midst of you , as ye yourselves also know :
him , being delivered by the determin@@ ate counsel and fore@@ knowledge of God , ye have taken , and by wicked hands have cruci@@ fied and sl@@ ain :
for David spe@@ ak@@ eth concerning him , I fores@@ aw the Lord always before my face , for he is on my right hand , that I should not be moved :
because thou wil@@ t not leave my soul in hell , neither wil@@ t thou suffer th@@ ine Holy One to see corruption .
thou hast made known to me the ways of life ; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy coun@@ tenance .
therefore being by the right hand of God exalted , and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost , he hath shed forth this , which ye now see and hear .
for David is not asc@@ ended into the heavens : but he sa@@ ith himself , The LORD said unto my Lord , S@@ it thou on my right hand ,
therefore let all the house of Israel know assu@@ re@@ dly , that God hath made that same Jesus , whom ye have cruci@@ fied , both Lord and Christ .
then Peter said unto them , Rep@@ ent , and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the rem@@ is@@ sion of sins , and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost .
then they that gladly received his word were baptized : and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls .
and they , continuing daily with one accord in the temple , and breaking bread from house to house , did eat their meat with gl@@ ad@@ ness and sing@@ l@@ eness of heart ,
pra@@ ising God , and having favour with all the people . and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved .
and a certain man lame from his mother 's womb was carried , whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Be@@ auti@@ ful , to ask al@@ ms of them that entered into the temple ;
and he took him by the right hand , and lifted him up : and immediately his feet and anc@@ le bones received strength .
and they knew that it was he which sat for al@@ ms at the Be@@ auti@@ ful gate of the temple : and they were filled with wonder and amaz@@ ement at that which had happened unto him .
and as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John , all the people ran together unto them in the por@@ ch that is called Solomon 's , greatly wondering .
and when Peter saw it , he answered unto the people , Y@@ e men of Israel , why mar@@ vel ye at this ? or why look ye so ear@@ ne@@ stly on us , as though by our own power or hol@@ iness we had made this man to walk ?
the God of Abraham , and of Isaac , and of Jacob , the God of our fathers , hath glori@@ fied his Son Jesus ; whom ye delivered up , and denied him in the presence of Pil@@ ate , when he was determined to let him go .
and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong , whom ye see and know : ye@@ a , the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect sound@@ ness in the presence of you all .
whom the heaven must receive until the times of res@@ titution of all things , which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began .
for Moses truly said unto the fathers , A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren , like unto me ; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you .
ye@@ a , and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after , as many as have spoken , have likewise fore@@ told of these days .
unto you first God , having raised up his Son Jesus , sent him to bless you , in turning away every one of you from his ini@@ qu@@ ities .
and as they sp@@ ake unto the people , the priests , and the captain of the temple , and the Sad@@ duc@@ ees , came upon them ,
then Peter , filled with the Holy Ghost , said unto them , Y@@ e rulers of the people , and elders of Israel ,
be it known unto you all , and to all the people of Israel , that by the name of Jesus Christ of Naz@@ areth , whom ye cruci@@ fied , whom God raised from the dead , even by him do@@ th this man stand here before you whole .
now when they saw the bold@@ ness of Peter and John , and perceived that they were un@@ learned and ignorant men , they marv@@ elled ; and they took knowledge of them , that they had been with Jesus .
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves ,
saying , What shall we do to these men ? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem ; and we C@@ AN@@ NOT deny it .
but Peter and John answered and said unto them , Whe@@ ther it be right in the sight of God to hear@@ ken unto you more than unto God , judge ye .
so when they had further threatened them , they let them go , finding nothing how they might punish them , because of the people : for all men glori@@ fied God for that which was done .
for of a truth against thy holy child Jesus , whom thou hast ano@@ inted , both Her@@ od , and Pon@@ ti@@ us Pil@@ ate , with the Genti@@ les , and the people of Israel , were gathered together ,
by stretching forth th@@ ine hand to heal ; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus .
and when they had prayed , the place was shaken where they were assembled together ; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost , and they sp@@ ake the word of God with bold@@ ness .
and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul : neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own ; but they had all things common .
neither was there any among them that lacked : for as many as were poss@@ essors of lands or houses sold them , and brought the prices of the things that were sold ,
and laid them down at the apostles ' feet : and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need .
but Peter said , An@@ ani@@ as , why hath Satan filled th@@ ine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost , and to keep back part of the price of the land ?
then fell she down strai@@ gh@@ tw@@ ay at his feet , and yielded up the ghost : and the young men came in , and found her dead , and , carrying her forth , buried her by her husband .
but the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors , and brought them forth , and said ,
saying , The prison truly found we shut with all safety , and the keepers standing without before the doors : but when we had opened , we found no man within .
now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things , they doubted of them where@@ unto this would grow .
saying , Did not we stra@@ itly command you that ye should not teach in this name ? and , behold , ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine , and intend to bring this man 's blood upon us .
after this man rose up Jud@@ as of Gal@@ ilee in the days of the taxing , and drew away much people after him : he also perished ; and all , even as many as obeyed him , were dispersed .
and they departed from the presence of the council , rejo@@ icing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name .
and in those days , when the number of the disciples was multiplied , there arose a mur@@ m@@ uring of the Gre@@ cians against the He@@ bre@@ ws , because their wid@@ ows were neglected in the daily ministr@@ ation .
W@@ herefore , brethren , look ye out among you seven men of honest report , full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom , whom we may appoint over this business .
and he said , Men , brethren , and fathers , hear@@ ken ; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham , when he was in Mes@@ op@@ ot@@ am@@ ia , before he d@@ wel@@ t in Char@@ ran ,
then came he out of the land of the Chal@@ da@@ e@@ ans , and d@@ wel@@ t in Char@@ ran : and from th@@ ence , when his father was dead , he removed him into this land , where@@ in ye now dwell .
and were carried over into Sy@@ che@@ m , and laid in the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Em@@ m@@ or the father of Sy@@ che@@ m .
the same dealt sub@@ til@@ ly with our kind@@ red , and evil entre@@ ated our fathers , so that they cast out their young children , to the end they might not live .
and Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians , and was mighty in words and in deeds .
and seeing one of them suffer wrong , he defended him , and av@@ eng@@ ed him that was oppressed , and smo@@ te the Egyptian :
and the next day he sh@@ ew@@ ed himself unto them as they stro@@ ve , and would have set them at one again , saying , S@@ irs , ye are brethren ; why do ye wrong one to another ?
but he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away , saying , Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us ?
this Moses whom they refused , saying , Who made thee a ruler and a judge ? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliver@@ er by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush .
he brought them out , after that he had sh@@ ew@@ ed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt , and in the Red sea , and in the wilderness forty years .
this is he , that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which sp@@ ake to him in the mount S@@ ina , and with our fathers : who received the lively or@@ acles to give unto us :
to whom our fathers would not obey , but thrust him from them , and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt ,
saying unto Aaron , Make us gods to go before us : for as for this Moses , which brought us out of the land of Egypt , we w@@ ot not what is become of him .
and they made a cal@@ f in those days , and offered sacrifice unto the idol , and rejo@@ iced in the works of their own hands .
ye@@ a , ye took up the tab@@ ern@@ acle of Molo@@ ch , and the star of your god Rem@@ ph@@ an , figures which ye made to worship them : and I will carry you away beyond Babylon .
which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Genti@@ les , whom God dra@@ ve out before the face of our fathers , unto the days of David ;
but he , being full of the Holy Ghost , looked up st@@ ed@@ fast@@ ly into heaven , and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing on the right hand of God ,
and cast him out of the city , and st@@ oned him : and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man 's feet , whose name was Saul .
and Saul was con@@ sent@@ ing unto his death . and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem ; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Juda@@ ea and Sam@@ aria , except the apostles .
as for Saul , he made ha@@ v@@ ock of the church , entering into every house , and hal@@ ing men and women committed them to prison .
and the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip sp@@ ake , hearing and seeing the miracles which he did .
but there was a certain man , called Simon , which be@@ fore@@ time in the same city used sor@@ cery , and be@@ wit@@ ched the people of Sam@@ aria , giving out that himself was some great one :
to whom they all gave heed , from the least to the greatest , saying , This man is the great power of God .
and to him they had regard , because that of long time he had be@@ wit@@ ched them with sorcer@@ ies .
but when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God , and the name of Jesus Christ , they were baptized , both men and women .
now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Sam@@ aria had received the word of God , they sent unto them Peter and John :
who , when they were come down , prayed for them , that they might receive the Holy Ghost :
and when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles ' hands the Holy Ghost was given , he offered them money ,
then answered Simon , and said , Pr@@ ay ye to the Lord for me , that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me .
and they , when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord , returned to Jerusalem , and preached the gospel in many villages of the Sam@@ ar@@ it@@ ans .
and the angel of the Lord sp@@ ake unto Philip , saying , A@@ rise , and go toward the south unto the way that go@@ eth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza , which is desert .
and he arose and went : and , behold , a man of Ethiopia , an e@@ un@@ uch of great authority under C@@ and@@ ace queen of the Ethiop@@ ians , who had the charge of all her treasure , and had come to Jerusalem for to worship ,
and he said , How can I , except some man should guide me ? and he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him .
and Saul , yet breathing out threat@@ en@@ ings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord , went unto the high priest ,
and desired of him letters to Damascus to the syn@@ agogues , that if he found any of this way , whether they were men or women , he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem .
and he said , Who art thou , Lord ? and the Lord said , I am Jesus whom thou persec@@ ut@@ est : it is hard for thee to kick against the pr@@ icks .
and he trembling and astonished said , Lord , what wil@@ t thou have me to do ? and the Lord said unto him , A@@ rise , and go into the city , and it shall be told thee what thou must do .
and Saul arose from the earth ; and when his eyes were opened , he saw no man : but they led him by the hand , and brought him into Damascus .
and there was a certain disciple at Damascus , named An@@ ani@@ as ; and to him said the Lord in a vision , An@@ ani@@ as . and he said , Be@@ hold , I am here , Lord .
and the Lord said unto him , A@@ rise , and go into the street which is called Str@@ ai@@ ght , and inqu@@ ire in the house of Jud@@ as for one called Saul , of Tar@@ sus : for , behold , he pra@@ y@@ eth ,
but the Lord said unto him , Go thy way : for he is a chosen vessel unto me , to bear my name before the Genti@@ les , and kings , and the children of Israel :
and An@@ ani@@ as went his way , and entered into the house ; and putting his hands on him said , Brother Saul , the Lord , even Jesus , that appeared unto thee in the way as thou cam@@ est , hath sent me , that thou mi@@ gh@@ test receive thy sight , and be filled with the Holy Ghost .
and when he had received meat , he was strengthened . then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus .
then the disciples took him by night , and let him down by the wall in a basket .
but Bar@@ nab@@ as took him , and brought him to the apostles , and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way , and that he had spoken to him , and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus .
which when the brethren knew , they brought him down to Caes@@ area , and sent him forth to Tar@@ sus .
then had the churches rest throughout all Juda@@ ea and Gal@@ ilee and Sam@@ aria , and were edi@@ fied ; and walking in the fear of the Lord , and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost , were multiplied .
and it came to pass , as Peter passed throughout all quarters , he came down also to the saints which d@@ wel@@ t at Ly@@ d@@ da .
and there he found a certain man named A@@ en@@ e@@ as , which had kept his bed eight years , and was sick of the pal@@ sy .
and for@@ as@@ much as Ly@@ d@@ da was ni@@ gh to J@@ op@@ pa , and the disciples had heard that Peter was there , they sent unto him two men , desi@@ ring him that he would not delay to come to them .
then Peter arose and went with them . when he was come , they brought him into the upper chamber : and all the wid@@ ows stood by him we@@ eping , and sh@@ ew@@ ing the coats and garments which dor@@ c@@ as made , while she was with them .
but Peter put them all forth , and kne@@ eled down , and prayed ; and turning him to the body said , Tab@@ i@@ tha , arise . and she opened her eyes : and when she saw Peter , she sat up .
he saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him , and saying unto him , Corn@@ eli@@ us .
and when he looked on him , he was afraid , and said , What is it , Lord ? and he said unto him , Th@@ y prayers and th@@ ine al@@ ms are come up for a memorial before God .
and when the angel which sp@@ ake unto Corn@@ eli@@ us was departed , he called two of his household servants , and a dev@@ out soldier of them that waited on him continually ;
on the mor@@ row , as they went on their journey , and drew ni@@ gh unto the city , Peter went up upon the hous@@ et@@ op to pray about the sixth hour :
and saw heaven opened , and a certain vessel descending unto him , as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners , and let down to the earth :
now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean , behold , the men which were sent from Corn@@ eli@@ us had made inquiry for Simon 's house , and stood before the gate ,
then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Corn@@ eli@@ us ; and said , Be@@ hold , I am he whom ye seek : what is the cause where@@ fore ye are come ?
and the mor@@ row after they entered into Caes@@ area . and Corn@@ eli@@ us waited for them , and had called together his kin@@ smen and near friends .
and as Peter was coming in , Corn@@ eli@@ us met him , and fell down at his feet , and wor@@ shipped him .
therefore came I unto you without g@@ ain@@ saying , as soon as I was sent for : I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me ?
and Corn@@ eli@@ us said , Four days ago I was fasting until this hour ; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house , and , behold , a man stood before me in bright clothing ,
and said , Corn@@ eli@@ us , thy prayer is heard , and th@@ ine al@@ ms are had in rem@@ embrance in the sight of God .
immediately therefore I sent to thee ; and thou hast well done that thou art come . now therefore are we all here present before God , to hear all things that are commanded thee of God .
the word which God sent unto the children of Israel , preaching peace by Jesus Christ : ( he is Lord of all : )
how God ano@@ inted Jesus of Naz@@ areth with the Holy Ghost and with power : who went about doing good , and healing all that were oppressed of the devil ; for God was with him .
and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews , and in Jerusalem ; whom they sle@@ w and han@@ ged on a tree :
not to all the people , but unto witnesses chosen before of God , even to us , who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead .
can any man forbid water , that these should not be baptized , which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we ?
and he sh@@ ew@@ ed us how he had seen an angel in his house , which stood and said unto him , Send men to J@@ op@@ pa , and call for Simon , whose surname is Peter ;
then remembered I the word of the Lord , how that he said , John indeed baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost .
when they heard these things , they held their peace , and glori@@ fied God , saying , Then hath God also to the Genti@@ les granted repentance unto life .
now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Ph@@ en@@ ice , and Cyprus , and Anti@@ o@@ ch , preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only .
and some of them were men of Cyprus and Cy@@ rene , which , when they were come to Anti@@ o@@ ch , sp@@ ake unto the Gre@@ cians , preaching the Lord Jesus .
for he was a good man , and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith : and much people was added unto the Lord .
and there stood up one of them named Ag@@ ab@@ us , and signi@@ fied by the spirit that there should be great de@@ ar@@ th throughout all the world : which came to pass in the days of Clau@@ di@@ us Caes@@ ar .
then the disciples , every man according to his ability , determined to send relief unto the brethren which d@@ wel@@ t in Juda@@ ea :
which also they did , and sent it to the elders by the hands of Bar@@ nab@@ as and Saul .
and when he had ap@@ preh@@ ended him , he put him in prison , and delivered him to four qu@@ ater@@ ni@@ ons of soldiers to keep him ; inten@@ ding after Easter to bring him forth to the people .
Peter therefore was kept in prison : but prayer was made without c@@ easing of the church unto God for him .
and when Her@@ od would have brought him forth , the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers , bound with two chains : and the keepers before the door kept the prison .
and , behold , the angel of the Lord came upon him , and a light sh@@ ined in the prison : and he smo@@ te Peter on the side , and raised him up , saying , A@@ rise up quickly . and his chains fell off from his hands .
and the angel said unto him , G@@ ird thy@@ self , and bind on thy sand@@ als . and so he did . and he sa@@ ith unto him , C@@ ast thy garment about thee , and follow me .
and he went out , and followed him ; and w@@ ist not that it was true which was done by the angel ; but thought he saw a vision .
but he , bec@@ k@@ oning unto them with the hand to hold their peace , declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison . and he said , Go sh@@ ew these things unto James , and to the brethren . and he departed , and went into another place .
now as soon as it was day , there was no small stir among the soldiers , what was become of Peter .
and immediately the angel of the Lord smo@@ te him , because he gave not God the glory : and he was eaten of worms , and gave up the ghost .
now there were in the church that was at Anti@@ o@@ ch certain prophets and teachers ; as Bar@@ nab@@ as , and Sim@@ eon that was called Niger , and Luci@@ us of Cy@@ rene , and Man@@ a@@ en , which had been brought up with Her@@ od the te@@ tr@@ arch , and Saul .
so they , being sent forth by the Holy Ghost , departed unto Sel@@ eu@@ cia ; and from th@@ ence they s@@ ailed to Cyprus .
and when they were at Sal@@ am@@ is , they preached the word of God in the syn@@ agogues of the Jews : and they had also John to their minister .
which was with the deputy of the country , Sergi@@ us PA@@ UL@@ US , a prudent man ; who called for Bar@@ nab@@ as and Saul , and desired to hear the word of God .
then Saul , ( who also is called Paul , ) filled with the Holy Ghost , set his eyes on him ,
and said , O full of all sub@@ til@@ ty and all mis@@ chief , thou child of the devil , thou enemy of all righteousness , wil@@ t thou not cease to perver@@ t the right ways of the Lord ?
and now , behold , the hand of the Lord is upon thee , and thou shalt be blind , not seeing the sun for a season . and immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness ; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand .
but when they departed from Per@@ ga , they came to Anti@@ o@@ ch in Pi@@ si@@ dia , and went into the synagogue on the sab@@ bath day , and sat down .
then Paul stood up , and bec@@ k@@ oning with his hand said , Men of Israel , and ye that fear God , give audience .
and when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chan@@ a@@ an , he divided their land to them by lot .
and after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years , until Samuel the prophet .
and afterward they desired a king : and God gave unto them Saul the son of CIS , a man of the tribe of Benjamin , by the space of forty years .
of this man 's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour , Jesus :
men and brethren , children of the stock of Abraham , and wh@@ oso@@ ever among you fe@@ areth God , to you is the word of this salvation sent .
W@@ herefore he sa@@ ith also in another p@@ sal@@ m , Th@@ ou shalt not suffer th@@ ine Holy One to see corruption .
be it known unto you therefore , men and brethren , that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins :
and by him all that believe are justified from all things , from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses .
behold , ye desp@@ isers , and wonder , and perish : for I work a work in your days , a work which ye shall in no wise believe , though a man declare it unto you .
but when the Jews saw the multi@@ tudes , they were filled with envy , and sp@@ ake against those things which were spoken by Paul , contradic@@ ting and bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ing .
then Paul and Bar@@ nab@@ as wa@@ xed bold , and said , It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you : but seeing ye put it from you , and judge yourselves un@@ worthy of everlasting life , lo , we turn to the Genti@@ les .
and when the Genti@@ les heard this , they were glad , and glori@@ fied the word of the Lord : and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed .
but the Jews stirred up the dev@@ out and hon@@ our@@ able women , and the chief men of the city , and raised persecution against Paul and Bar@@ nab@@ as , and expelled them out of their co@@ asts .
long time therefore ab@@ ode they speaking boldly in the Lord , which gave testimony unto the word of his grace , and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands .
they were ware of it , and fled unto Ly@@ stra and Der@@ be , cities of Ly@@ ca@@ onia , and unto the region that li@@ eth round about :
said with a loud voice , Stand upright on thy feet . and he le@@ aped and walked .
and when the people saw what Paul had done , they lifted up their voices , saying in the speech of Ly@@ ca@@ onia , The gods are come down to us in the lik@@ eness of men .
nevertheless he left not himself without witness , in that he did good , and gave us rain from heaven , and fruitful seasons , filling our hearts with food and gl@@ ad@@ ness .
How@@ be@@ it , as the disciples stood round about him , he rose up , and came into the city : and the next day he departed with Bar@@ nab@@ as to Der@@ be .
confirming the souls of the disciples , and ex@@ hor@@ ting them to continue in the faith , and that we must through much tribu@@ lation enter into the kingdom of God .
and when they had ordained them elders in every church , and had prayed with fasting , they commended them to the Lord , on whom they believed .
and th@@ ence s@@ ailed to Anti@@ o@@ ch , from wh@@ ence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled .
when therefore Paul and Bar@@ nab@@ as had no small dis@@ sen@@ sion and disput@@ ation with them , they determined that Paul and Bar@@ nab@@ as , and certain other of them , should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question .
and being brought on their way by the church , they passed through Ph@@ en@@ ice and Sam@@ aria , declaring the conversion of the Genti@@ les : and they caused great joy unto all the brethren .
and when there had been much disput@@ ing , Peter rose up , and said unto them , Men and brethren , ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us , that the Genti@@ les by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel , and believe .
then all the multitude kept silence , and gave audience to Bar@@ nab@@ as and Paul , declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Genti@@ les by them .
that the resi@@ due of men might seek after the Lord , and all the Genti@@ les , upon whom my name is called , sa@@ ith the Lord , who do@@ eth all these things .
and they wrote letters by them after this manner ; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Genti@@ les in Anti@@ o@@ ch and Syria and C@@ il@@ icia :
for@@ as@@ much as we have heard , that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words , subver@@ ting your souls , saying , Y@@ e must be circum@@ c@@ ised , and keep the law : to whom we gave no such commandment :
for it seemed good to the Holy Ghost , and to us , to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things ;
and some days after Paul said unto Bar@@ nab@@ as , Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord , and see how they do .
and the contention was so sharp between them , that they departed as@@ under one from the other : and so Bar@@ nab@@ as took Mark , and s@@ ailed unto Cyprus ;
now when they had gone throughout Ph@@ ry@@ gia and the region of Gal@@ atia , and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia ,
after they were come to My@@ sia , they ass@@ ayed to go into Bi@@ thy@@ nia : but the Spirit suffered them not .
and a vision appeared to Paul in the night ; There stood a man of Macedonia , and prayed him , saying , Come over into Macedonia , and help us .
and from th@@ ence to Philipp@@ i , which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia , and a colony : and we were in that city abiding certain days .
and on the sab@@ bath we went out of the city by a river side , where prayer was won@@ t to be made ; and we sat down , and sp@@ ake unto the women which resorted thi@@ ther .
and a certain woman named Ly@@ dia , a seller of purple , of the city of T@@ hy@@ ati@@ ra , which wor@@ shipped God , heard us : whose heart the Lord opened , that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul .
and when she was baptized , and her household , she bes@@ ought us , saying , If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord , come into my house , and abide there . and she constrained us .
the same followed Paul and us , and cried , saying , These men are the servants of the most high God , which sh@@ ew unto us the way of salvation .
and this did she many days . but Paul , being griev@@ ed , turned and said to the spirit , I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her . and he came out the same hour .
and when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone , they caught Paul and Sil@@ as , and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers ,
and when they had laid many stri@@ pes upon them , they cast them into prison , charging the j@@ ail@@ or to keep them safely :
who , having received such a charge , thrust them into the inner prison , and made their feet fast in the stocks .
and the keeper of the prison aw@@ aking out of his sleep , and seeing the prison doors open , he drew out his sword , and would have killed himself , sup@@ posing that the prisoners had been fled .
then he called for a light , and sprang in , and came trembling , and fell down before Paul and Sil@@ as ,
and when he had brought them into his house , he set meat before them , and rejo@@ iced , believing in God with all his house .
but Paul said unto them , They have beaten us openly un@@ condemned , being Romans , and have cast us into prison ; and now do they thrust us out priv@@ ily ? n@@ ay verily ; but let them come themselves and fetch us out .
and they came and bes@@ ought them , and brought them out , and desired them to depart out of the city .
and they went out of the prison , and entered into the house of Ly@@ dia and when they had seen the brethren , they comfor@@ ted them , and departed .
now when they had passed through A@@ mp@@ hi@@ pol@@ is and Apoll@@ onia , they came to Thess@@ alon@@ ica , where was a synagogue of the Jews :
and Paul , as his manner was , went in unto them , and three sab@@ bath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures ,
opening and alleg@@ ing , that Christ must needs have suffered , and risen again from the dead ; and that this Jesus , whom I preach unto you , is Christ .
whom Jason hath received : and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caes@@ ar , saying that there is another king , one Jesus .
and when they had taken security of Jason , and of the other , they let them go .
therefore many of them believed ; also of hon@@ our@@ able women which were Greeks , and of men , not a few .
but when the Jews of Thess@@ alon@@ ica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Ber@@ ea , they came thi@@ ther also , and stirred up the people .
and then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea : but Sil@@ as and Timo@@ the@@ us ab@@ ode there still .
and they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens : and receiving a commandment unto Sil@@ as and Timo@@ the@@ us for to come to him with all speed , they departed .
therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews , and with the dev@@ out persons , and in the market daily with them that met with him .
then Paul stood in the midst of Mars ' hill , and said , Y@@ e men of Athens , I perceive that in all things ye are too supersti@@ tious .
for in him we live , and move , and have our being ; as certain also of your own poets have said , For we are also his offspring .
for@@ as@@ much then as we are the offspring of God , we ought not to think that the God@@ head is like unto gold , or silver , or stone , gra@@ ven by art and man 's device .
and the times of this ignorance God win@@ ked at ; but now comman@@ det@@ h all men every where to repent :
and when they heard of the resurrection of the dead , some mo@@ cked : and others said , We will hear thee again of this matter .
and because he was of the same craft , he ab@@ ode with them , and wrought : for by their occupation they were tent@@ makers .
and when they opposed themselves , and bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed , he shook his ra@@ iment , and said unto them , Your blood be upon your own heads ; I am clean : from h@@ ence@@ forth I will go unto the Genti@@ les .
and he departed th@@ ence , and entered into a certain man 's house , named Ju@@ st@@ us , one that wor@@ shipped God , whose house joined hard to the synagogue .
and Cris@@ pus , the chief ruler of the synagogue , believed on the Lord with all his house ; and many of the Corinth@@ ians hearing believed , and were baptized .
and when G@@ alli@@ o was the deputy of Ac@@ ha@@ ia , the Jews made insurrec@@ tion with one accord against Paul , and brought him to the judgment seat ,
and when Paul was now about to open his mouth , G@@ alli@@ o said unto the Jews , If it were a matter of wrong or wicked le@@ w@@ dness , O ye Jews , reason would that I should bear with you :
then all the Greeks took S@@ os@@ then@@ es , the chief ruler of the synagogue , and beat him before the judgment seat . and G@@ alli@@ o cared for none of those things .
and Paul after this tar@@ ried there yet a good while , and then took his leave of the brethren , and s@@ ailed th@@ ence into Syria , and with him P@@ ris@@ c@@ illa and Aqu@@ ila ; having shor@@ n his head in Cen@@ ch@@ rea : for he had a vo@@ w .
and he came to E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , and left them there : but he himself entered into the synagogue , and reasoned with the Jews .
and when he had landed at Caes@@ area , and gone up , and sal@@ uted the church , he went down to Anti@@ o@@ ch .
and after he had spent some time there , he departed , and went over all the country of Gal@@ atia and Ph@@ ry@@ gia in order , strengthening all the disciples .
this man was instructed in the way of the Lord ; and being ferv@@ ent in the spirit , he sp@@ ake and taught dilig@@ ently the things of the Lord , knowing only the baptism of John .
and when he was disposed to pass into Ac@@ ha@@ ia , the brethren wrote , ex@@ hor@@ ting the disciples to receive him : who , when he was come , helped them much which had believed through grace :
and it came to pass , that , while A@@ pol@@ los was at Cor@@ inth , Paul having passed through the upper co@@ asts came to E@@ ph@@ es@@ us : and finding certain disciples ,
he said unto them , Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed ? and they said unto him , We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost .
but when divers were hardened , and believed not , but sp@@ ake evil of that way before the multitude , he departed from them , and separated the disciples , disput@@ ing daily in the school of one Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ us .
and this continued by the space of two years ; so that all they which d@@ wel@@ t in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus , both Jews and Greeks .
then certain of the vag@@ ab@@ ond Jews , Ex@@ or@@ cists , took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus , saying , We ad@@ j@@ ure you by Jesus whom Paul pre@@ ach@@ eth .
and this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at E@@ ph@@ es@@ us ; and fear fell on them all , and the name of the Lord Jesus was magni@@ fied .
many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together , and burned them before all men : and they counted the price of them , and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver .
after these things were ended , Paul pur@@ posed in the spirit , when he had passed through Macedonia and Ac@@ ha@@ ia , to go to Jerusalem , saying , After I have been there , I must also see Rome .
so he sent into Macedonia two of them that minist@@ ered unto him , Timo@@ the@@ us and E@@ ra@@ st@@ us ; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season .
for a certain man named Dem@@ et@@ ri@@ us , a sil@@ vers@@ mith , which made silver shr@@ ines for Diana , brought no small gain unto the craftsmen ;
and certain of the chief of Asia , which were his friends , sent unto him , desi@@ ring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre .
but when they knew that he was a Jew , all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out , Great is Diana of the Ep@@ he@@ sians .
W@@ herefore if Dem@@ et@@ ri@@ us , and the craftsmen which are with him , have a matter against any man , the law is open , and there are deputies : let them impl@@ e@@ ad one another .
and when he had gone over those parts , and had given them much ex@@ hor@@ tation , he came into Greece ,
and there accompanied him into Asia Sop@@ ater of Ber@@ ea ; and of the Thess@@ al@@ onians , Ari@@ star@@ ch@@ us and Sec@@ und@@ us ; and Gai@@ us of Der@@ be , and Timo@@ the@@ us ; and of Asia , Ty@@ ch@@ ic@@ us and Tro@@ ph@@ im@@ us .
and upon the first day of the week , when the disciples came together to break bread , Paul preached unto them , ready to depart on the mor@@ row ; and continued his speech until midnight .
and there sat in a window a certain young man named E@@ ut@@ y@@ ch@@ us , being fallen into a deep sleep : and as Paul was long preaching , he sunk down with sleep , and fell down from the third lo@@ ft , and was taken up dead .
for Paul had determined to sail by E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , because he would not spend the time in Asia : for he ha@@ sted , if it were possible for him , to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentec@@ ost .
and when they were come to him , he said unto them , Y@@ e know , from the first day that I came into Asia , after what manner I have been with you at all seasons ,
but none of these things move me , neither count I my life dear unto myself , so that I might finish my course with joy , and the ministry , which I have received of the Lord Jesus , to testify the gospel of the grace of God .
take heed therefore unto yourselves , and to all the flock , over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you over@@ se@@ ers , to feed the church of God , which he hath purchased with his own blood .
therefore watch , and remember , that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears .
I have sh@@ ew@@ ed you all things , how that so lab@@ ouring ye ought to support the weak , and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus , how he said , It is more blessed to give than to receive .
sor@@ rowing most of all for the words which he sp@@ ake , that they should see his face no more . and they accompanied him unto the ship .
now when we had discovered Cyprus , we left it on the left hand , and s@@ ailed into Syria , and landed at Ty@@ re : for there the ship was to un@@ l@@ ade her burden .
and the next day we that were of Paul 's company departed , and came unto Caes@@ area : and we entered into the house of Philip the evangel@@ ist , which was one of the seven ; and ab@@ ode with him .
and when he had sal@@ uted them , he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Genti@@ les by his ministry .
what is it therefore ? the multitude must needs come together : for they will hear that thou art come .
as touching the Genti@@ les which believe , we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing , save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols , and from blood , and from strang@@ led , and from for@@ n@@ ication .
then Paul took the men , and the next day puri@@ fying himself with them entered into the temple , to signi@@ fy the accomplishment of the days of puri@@ f@@ c@@ ation , until that an offering should be offered for every one of them .
and when the seven days were almost ended , the Jews which were of Asia , when they saw him in the temple , stirred up all the people , and laid hands on him ,
( for they had seen before with him in the city Tro@@ ph@@ im@@ us an Ep@@ he@@ sian , whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple . )
and as they went about to kill him , ti@@ dings came unto the chief captain of the band , that all Jerusalem was in an upro@@ ar .
who immediately took soldiers and cent@@ ur@@ ions , and ran down unto them : and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers , they left beating of Paul .
then the chief captain came near , and took him , and commanded him to be bound with two chains ; and demanded who he was , and what he had done .
and some cried one thing , some another , among the multitude : and when he could not know the certainty for the tum@@ ult , he commanded him to be carried into the castle .
and when he came upon the stairs , so it was , that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people .
and as Paul was to be led into the castle , he said unto the chief captain , May I speak unto thee ? who said , can@@ st thou speak Greek ?
art not thou that Egyptian , which before these days mad@@ est an upro@@ ar , and le@@ dd@@ est out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers ?
and when he had given him licence , Paul stood on the stairs , and bec@@ k@@ oned with the hand unto the people . and when there was made a great silence , he sp@@ ake unto them in the Hebrew tongue , saying ,
( and when they heard that he sp@@ ake in the Hebrew tongue to them , they kept the more silence : and he sa@@ ith , )
as also the high priest do@@ th bear me witness , and all the estate of the elders : from whom also I received letters unto the brethren , and went to Damascus , to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem , for to be punished .
and I answered , Who art thou , Lord ? and he said unto me , I am Jesus of Naz@@ areth , whom thou persec@@ ut@@ est .
and they that were with me saw indeed the light , and were afraid ; but they heard not the voice of him that sp@@ ake to me .
and I said , What shall I do , Lord ? and the Lord said unto me , A@@ rise , and go into Damascus ; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do .
and when I could not see for the glory of that light , being led by the hand of them that were with me , I came into Damascus .
and one An@@ ani@@ as , a dev@@ out man according to the law , having a good report of all the Jews which d@@ wel@@ t there ,
came unto me , and stood , and said unto me , Brother Saul , receive thy sight . and the same hour I looked up upon him .
and he said , The God of our fathers hath chosen thee , that thou shoul@@ dest know his will , and see that Just One , and shoul@@ dest hear the voice of his mouth .
and now why tar@@ ri@@ est thou ? arise , and be baptized , and wash away thy sins , calling on the name of the Lord .
and when the blood of thy marty@@ r Stephen was shed , I also was standing by , and con@@ sent@@ ing unto his death , and kept the ra@@ iment of them that sle@@ w him .
and as they cried out , and cast off their clothes , and threw dust into the air ,
the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle , and b@@ ade that he should be examined by scour@@ ging ; that he might know where@@ fore they cried so against him .
and as they bound him with th@@ ongs , Paul said unto the cent@@ ur@@ ion that stood by , Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman , and un@@ condemned ?
when the cent@@ ur@@ ion heard that , he went and told the chief captain , saying , Take heed what thou do@@ est : for this man is a Roman .
then strai@@ gh@@ tw@@ ay they departed from him which should have examined him : and the chief captain also was afraid , after he knew that he was a Roman , and because he had bound him .
on the mor@@ row , because he would have known the certainty where@@ fore he was accused of the Jews , he loos@@ ed him from his bands , and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear , and brought Paul down , and set him before them .
and the high priest An@@ ani@@ as commanded them that stood by him to sm@@ ite him on the mouth .
then said Paul unto him , God shall sm@@ ite thee , thou wh@@ ited wall : for sit@@ test thou to judge me after the law , and command@@ est me to be sm@@ it@@ ten contrary to the law ?
then said Paul , I w@@ ist not , brethren , that he was the high priest : for it is written , Th@@ ou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people .
and when he had so said , there arose a dis@@ sen@@ sion between the Pharis@@ ees and the Sad@@ duc@@ ees : and the multitude was divided .
and there arose a great cry : and the scri@@ bes that were of the Pharis@@ ees ' part arose , and stro@@ ve , saying , We find no evil in this man : but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him , let us not fight against God .
and the night following the Lord stood by him , and said , Be of good che@@ er , Paul : for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem , so must thou bear witness also at Rome .
and they came to the chief priests and elders , and said , We have bound ourselves under a great curse , that we will eat nothing until we have sl@@ ain Paul .
and when Paul 's sister 's son heard of their lying in wait , he went and entered into the castle , and told Paul .
then Paul called one of the cent@@ ur@@ ions unto him , and said , B@@ ring this young man unto the chief captain : for he hath a certain thing to tell him .
so he took him , and brought him to the chief captain , and said , Paul the prisoner called me unto him , and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee , who hath something to say unto thee .
then the chief captain took him by the hand , and went with him aside privately , and asked him , What is that thou hast to tell me ?
and he said , The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou w@@ oul@@ dest bring down Paul to mor@@ row into the council , as though they would inqu@@ ire somewhat of him more perfectly .
and he called unto him two cent@@ ur@@ ions , saying , Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caes@@ area , and hor@@ sem@@ en thre@@ es@@ core and ten , and spear@@ men two hundred , at the third hour of the night ;
and provide them beasts , that they may set Paul on , and bring him safe unto Felix the governor .
this man was taken of the Jews , and should have been killed of them : then came I with an army , and rescued him , having understood that he was a Roman .
and when I would have known the cause where@@ fore they accused him , I brought him forth into their council :
and when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man , I sent strai@@ gh@@ tw@@ ay to thee , and gave commandment to his acc@@ users also to say before thee what they had against him . farewell .
and after five days An@@ ani@@ as the high priest descended with the elders , and with a certain or@@ ator named Ter@@ t@@ ul@@ l@@ us , who informed the governor against Paul .
we accept it always , and in all places , most noble Felix , with all thank@@ fulness .
notwithstanding , that I be not further te@@ dious unto thee , I pray thee that thou w@@ oul@@ dest hear us of thy cl@@ em@@ ency a few words .
who also hath gone about to prof@@ ane the temple : whom we took , and would have judged according to our law .
then Paul , after that the governor had bec@@ k@@ oned unto him to speak , answered , for@@ as@@ much as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation , I do the more cheer@@ fully answer for myself :
but this I confess unto thee , that after the way which they call her@@ esy , so worship I the God of my fathers , believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets :
and have hope toward God , which they themselves also allow , that there shall be a resurrection of the dead , both of the just and unjust .
or else let these same here say , if they have found any evil doing in me , while I stood before the council ,
and he commanded a cent@@ ur@@ ion to keep Paul , and to let him have liberty , and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him .
and after certain days , when Felix came with his wife Dr@@ us@@ illa , which was a Jew@@ ess , he sent for Paul , and heard him concerning the faith in Christ .
he hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul , that he might loose him : W@@ herefore he sent for him the of@@ ten@@ er , and commun@@ ed with him .
but after two years Por@@ ci@@ us F@@ est@@ us came into Felix ' room : and Felix , willing to sh@@ ew the Jews a pleasure , left Paul bound .
and when he was come , the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about , and laid many and griev@@ ous complaints against Paul , which they could not prove .
but F@@ est@@ us , willing to do the Jews a pleasure , answered Paul , and said , Wil@@ t thou go up to Jerusalem , and there be judged of these things before me ?
then said Paul , I stand at Caes@@ ar 's judgment seat , where I ought to be judged : to the Jews have I done no wrong , as thou very well know@@ est .
for if I be an off@@ ender , or have committed any thing worthy of death , I refuse not to die : but if there be none of these things where@@ of these accuse me , no man may deliver me unto them . I appeal unto Caes@@ ar .
then F@@ est@@ us , when he had conferred with the council , answered , H@@ ast thou appealed unto Caes@@ ar ? unto Caes@@ ar shalt thou go .
about whom , when I was at Jerusalem , the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me , desi@@ ring to have judgment against him .
and because I doubted of such manner of questions , I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem , and there be judged of these matters .
and F@@ est@@ us said , King A@@ gri@@ pp@@ a , and all men which are here present with us , ye see this man , about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me , both at Jerusalem , and also here , crying that he ought not to live any longer .
of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord . W@@ herefore I have brought him forth before you , and specially before thee , O king A@@ gri@@ pp@@ a , that , after examination had , I might have somewhat to write .
for it seem@@ eth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner , and not with@@ al to signi@@ fy the crimes laid against him .
I think myself happy , king A@@ gri@@ pp@@ a , because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things where@@ of I am accused of the Jews :
especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews : W@@ herefore I bes@@ e@@ ech thee to hear me patiently .
unto which promise our twelve tribes , instantly serving God day and night , hope to come . for which hope 's sake , king A@@ gri@@ pp@@ a , I am accused of the Jews .
I verily thought with myself , that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Naz@@ areth .
which thing I also did in Jerusalem : and many of the saints did I shut up in prison , having received authority from the chief priests ; and when they were put to death , I gave my voice against them .
at mid@@ day , O king , I saw in the way a light from heaven , above the brightness of the sun , shining round about me and them which jour@@ ne@@ yed with me .
and when we were all fallen to the earth , I heard a voice speaking unto me , and saying in the Hebrew tongue , Saul , Saul , why persec@@ ut@@ est thou me ? it is hard for thee to kick against the pr@@ icks .
but rise , and stand upon thy feet : for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose , to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen , and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee ;
to open their eyes , and to turn them from darkness to light , and from the power of Satan unto God , that they may receive forgiveness of sins , and inheritance among them which are sancti@@ fied by faith that is in me .
but sh@@ ew@@ ed first unto them of Damascus , and at Jerusalem , and throughout all the co@@ asts of Juda@@ ea , and then to the Genti@@ les , that they should repent and turn to God , and do works meet for repentance .
that Christ should suffer , and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead , and should sh@@ ew light unto the people , and to the Genti@@ les .
and as he thus sp@@ ake for himself , F@@ est@@ us said with a loud voice , Paul , thou art beside thy@@ self ; much learning do@@ th make thee mad .
then said A@@ gri@@ pp@@ a unto F@@ est@@ us , This man might have been set at liberty , if he had not appealed unto Caes@@ ar .
and when it was determined that we should sail into Italy , they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Juli@@ us , a cent@@ ur@@ ion of August@@ us ' band .
and entering into a ship of A@@ dram@@ y@@ t@@ tium , we launched , meaning to sail by the co@@ asts of Asia ; one Ari@@ star@@ ch@@ us , a Macedonian of Thess@@ alon@@ ica , being with us .
and when we had launched from th@@ ence , we s@@ ailed under Cyprus , because the winds were contrary .
and when we had s@@ ailed slowly many days , and scarce were come over against C@@ ni@@ d@@ us , the wind not suffering us , we s@@ ailed under Crete , over against Sal@@ m@@ one ;
which when they had taken up , they used helps , under@@ gir@@ ding the ship ; and , fearing lest they should fall into the quick@@ sands , str@@ ake sail , and so were driven .
and when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared , and no small temp@@ est lay on us , all hope that we should be saved was then taken away .
but after long abst@@ in@@ ence Paul stood forth in the midst of them , and said , S@@ irs , ye should have hear@@ k@@ ened unto me , and not have loos@@ ed from Crete , and to have gained this harm and loss .
and now I ex@@ h@@ ort you to be of good che@@ er : for there shall be no loss of any man 's life among you , but of the ship .
W@@ herefore , si@@ rs , be of good che@@ er : for I believe God , that it shall be even as it was told me .
and sounded , and found it twenty F@@ ath@@ oms : and when they had gone a little further , they sounded again , and found it fifteen F@@ ath@@ oms .
then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks , they cast four anch@@ ors out of the stern , and wished for the day .
and while the day was coming on , Paul bes@@ ought them all to take meat , saying , This day is the four@@ teenth day that ye have tar@@ ried and continued fasting , having taken nothing .
W@@ herefore I pray you to take some meat : for this is for your health : for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you .
and when it was day , they knew not the land : but they discovered a certain cre@@ ek with a shore , into the which they were minded , if it were possible , to thrust in the ship .
and the soldiers ' counsel was to kill the prisoners , lest any of them should swim out , and escape .
but the cent@@ ur@@ ion , willing to save Paul , kept them from their purpose ; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea , and get to land :
and the rest , some on boards , and some on broken pieces of the ship . and so it came to pass , that they escaped all safe to land .
and the barbar@@ ous people sh@@ ew@@ ed us no little kindness : for they kind@@ led a fire , and received us every one , because of the present rain , and because of the cold .
and when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks , and laid them on the fire , there came a vi@@ per out of the heat , and fast@@ ened on his hand .
and when the bar@@ b@@ arians saw the ven@@ om@@ ous beast hang on his hand , they said among themselves , No doubt this man is a murderer , whom , though he hath escaped the sea , yet vengeance suffer@@ eth not to live .
in the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island , whose name was Pub@@ li@@ us ; who received us , and lodged us three days cour@@ te@@ ously .
and it came to pass , that the father of Pub@@ li@@ us lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux : to whom Paul entered in , and prayed , and laid his hands on him , and healed him .
so when this was done , others also , which had diseases in the island , came , and were healed :
and from th@@ ence we fetched a compass , and came to R@@ he@@ gi@@ um : and after one day the south wind blew , and we came the next day to Put@@ e@@ ol@@ i :
and from th@@ ence , when the brethren heard of us , they came to meet us as far as Ap@@ pi@@ i@@ forum , and The three ta@@ vern@@ s : whom when Paul saw , he thanked God , and took courage .
and when we came to Rome , the cent@@ ur@@ ion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard : but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him .
for this cause therefore have I called for you , to see you , and to speak with you : because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain .
and when they agreed not among themselves , they departed , after that Paul had spoken one word , Well sp@@ ake the Holy Ghost by Es@@ ai@@ as the prophet unto our fathers ,
saying , Go unto this people , and say , H@@ earing ye shall hear , and shall not understand ; and seeing ye shall see , and not perceive :
for the heart of this people is wa@@ xed gross , and their ears are dull of hearing , and their eyes have they closed ; lest they should see with their eyes , and hear with their ears , and understand with their heart , and should be converted , and I should heal them .
and when he had said these words , the Jews departed , and had great reasoning among themselves .
Paul , a servant of Jesus Christ , called to be an apostle , separated unto the gospel of God ,
to all that be in Rome , beloved of God , called to be saints : grace to you and peace from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ .
making request , if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you .
for I long to see you , that I may im@@ part unto you some spiritual gift , to the end ye may be established ;
so , as much as in me is , I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also .
for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ : for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believ@@ eth ; to the Jew first , and also to the Greek .
for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith : as it is written , The just shall live by faith .
for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all un@@ god@@ liness and un@@ righteousness of men , who hold the truth in un@@ righteousness ;
and changed the glory of the un@@ corrup@@ tible God into an image made like to corrup@@ tible man , and to birds , and four@@ foo@@ ted beasts , and cre@@ eping things .
who changed the truth of God into a lie , and wor@@ shipped and served the creature more than the Creator , who is blessed for ever . A@@ men .
and likewise also the men , leaving the natural use of the woman , burned in their lust one toward another ; men with men working that which is un@@ seem@@ ly , and receiving in themselves that re@@ comp@@ ence of their error which was meet .
who knowing the judgment of God , that they which commit such things are worthy of death , not only do the same , but have pleasure in them that do them .
but we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things .
and thin@@ k@@ est thou this , O man , that jud@@ gest them which do such things , and do@@ est the same , that thou shalt escape the judgment of God ?
behold , thou art called a Jew , and rest@@ est in the law , and mak@@ est thy boast of God ,
and art confident that thou thy@@ self art a guide of the blind , a light of them which are in darkness ,
for circum@@ cision verily prof@@ it@@ eth , if thou keep the law : but if thou be a breaker of the law , thy circum@@ cision is made un@@ circum@@ cision .
and shall not un@@ circum@@ cision which is by nature , if it fulfil the law , judge thee , who by the letter and circum@@ cision d@@ ost trans@@ gress the law ?
but he is a Jew , which is one in@@ war@@ dly ; and circum@@ cision is that of the heart , in the spirit , and not in the letter ; whose praise is not of men , but of God .
and not rather , ( as we be slan@@ der@@ ously reported , and as some affirm that we say , ) Let us do evil , that good may come ? whose dam@@ nation is just .
their throat is an open se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re ; with their tongues they have used dece@@ it ; the poison of as@@ ps is under their lips :
now we know that what things soever the law sa@@ ith , it sa@@ ith to them who are under the law : that every mouth may be stopped , and all the world may become guilty before God .
even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe : for there is no difference :
whom God hath set forth to be a prop@@ iti@@ ation through faith in his blood , to declare his righteousness for the rem@@ is@@ sion of sins that are past , through the for@@ bear@@ ance of God ;
to declare , I say , at this time his righteousness : that he might be just , and the justi@@ fier of him which believ@@ eth in Jesus .
is he the God of the Jews only ? is he not also of the Genti@@ les ? yes , of the Genti@@ les also :
com@@ eth this bl@@ es@@ se@@ dness then upon the circum@@ cision only , or upon the un@@ circum@@ cision also ? for we say that faith was reck@@ oned to Abraham for righteousness .
how was it then reck@@ oned ? when he was in circum@@ cision , or in un@@ circum@@ cision ? not in circum@@ cision , but in un@@ circum@@ cision .
and the father of circum@@ cision to them who are not of the circum@@ cision only , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham , which he had being yet un@@ circum@@ c@@ ised .
and being not weak in faith , he considered not his own body now dead , when he was about an hundred years old , neither yet the dead@@ ness of Sar@@ a 's womb :
he stagg@@ ered not at the promise of God through un@@ belief ; but was strong in faith , giving glory to God ;
and being fully persuaded that , what he had promised , he was able also to perform .
by whom also we have access by faith into this grace where@@ in we stand , and rejoice in hope of the glory of God .
and hope mak@@ eth not ashamed ; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us .
much more then , being now justified by his blood , we shall be saved from wrath through him .
for if , when we were enemies , we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son , much more , being reconciled , we shall be saved by his life .
but not as the offence , so also is the free gift . for if through the offence of one many be dead , much more the grace of God , and the gift by grace , which is by one man , Jesus Christ , hath ab@@ ounded unto many .
and not as it was by one that sin@@ ned , so is the gift : for the judgment was by one to condemnation , but the free gift is of many offences unto justification .
for if by one man 's offence death re@@ igned by one ; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one , Jesus Christ . )
for as by one man 's disobedience many were made sinners , so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous .
God forbid . how shall we , that are dead to sin , live any longer therein ?
therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death : that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father , even so we also should walk in new@@ ness of life .
for if we have been planted together in the lik@@ eness of his death , we shall be also in the lik@@ eness of his resurrection :
neither yield ye your members as instruments of un@@ righteousness unto sin : but yield yourselves unto God , as those that are alive from the dead , and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God .
but God be thanked , that ye were the servants of sin , but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you .
know ye not , brethren , ( for I speak to them that know the law , ) how that the law hath dom@@ inion over a man as long as he liv@@ eth ?
for when we were in the flesh , the motions of sins , which were by the law , did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death .
but now we are delivered from the law , that being dead where@@ in we were held ; that we should serve in new@@ ness of spirit , and not in the old@@ ness of the letter .
what shall we say then ? is the law sin ? God forbid . n@@ ay , I had not known sin , but by the law : for I had not known lust , except the law had said , Th@@ ou shalt not co@@ vet .
was then that which is good made death unto me ? God forbid . but sin , that it might appear sin , working death in me by that which is good ; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful .
for I know that in me ( that is , in my flesh , ) dwell@@ eth no good thing : for to will is present with me ; but how to perform that which is good I find not .
but I see another law in my members , war@@ ring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into cap@@ tivity to the law of sin which is in my members .
O w@@ ret@@ ched man that I am ! who shall deliver me from the body of this death ?
I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord . so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God ; but with the flesh the law of sin .
there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
for what the law could not do , in that it was weak through the flesh , God sending his own Son in the lik@@ eness of sinful flesh , and for sin , condemned sin in the flesh :
that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us , who walk not after the flesh , but after the Spirit .
but ye are not in the flesh , but in the Spirit , if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you . now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ , he is none of his .
and if Christ be in you , the body is dead because of sin ; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness .
but if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you , he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quick@@ en your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwell@@ eth in you .
and if children , then heirs ; heirs of God , and joint @@@ -@@ @ heirs with Christ ; if so be that we suffer with him , that we may be also glori@@ fied together .
for the creature was made subject to van@@ ity , not willingly , but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope ,
and not only they , but ourselves also , which have the fir@@ st@@ fruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves gro@@ an within ourselves , waiting for the adoption , to w@@ it , the redemption of our body .
likewise the Spirit also help@@ eth our in@@ firm@@ ities : for we know not what we should pray for as we ought : but the Spirit itself mak@@ eth interc@@ ession for us with gro@@ an@@ ings which C@@ AN@@ NOT be uttered .
for whom he did fore@@ know , he also did pre@@ dest@@ inate to be con@@ formed to the image of his Son , that he might be the fir@@ st@@ born among many brethren .
nor height , nor depth , nor any other creature , shall be able to separate us from the love of God , which is in Christ Jesus our Lord .
I say the truth in Christ , I lie not , my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost ,
for the scrip@@ ture sa@@ ith unto Phar@@ aoh , Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up , that I might sh@@ ew my power in thee , and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth .
n@@ ay but , O man , who art thou that repl@@ i@@ est against God ? shall the thing formed say to him that formed it , Why hast thou made me thus ?
Es@@ ai@@ as also cri@@ eth concerning Israel , Th@@ ough the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea , a remn@@ ant shall be saved :
W@@ herefore ? because they sought it not by faith , but as it were by the works of the law . for they stum@@ bled at that stum@@ bl@@ ing@@ stone ;
but what sa@@ ith it ? the word is ni@@ gh thee , even in thy mouth , and in thy heart : that is , the word of faith , which we preach ;
that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus , and shalt believe in th@@ ine heart that God hath raised him from the dead , thou shalt be saved .
for with the heart man believ@@ eth unto righteousness ; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation .
for there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek : for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him .
how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed ? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard ? and how shall they hear without a preacher ?
but I say , Have they not heard ? yes verily , their sound went into all the earth , and their words unto the ends of the world .
but I say , Did not Israel know ? first Moses sa@@ ith , I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people , and by a foolish nation I will anger you .
I say then , H@@ ath God cast away his people ? God forbid . for I also am an Israel@@ ite , of the seed of Abraham , of the tribe of Benjamin .
Lord , they have killed thy prophets , and di@@ gged down th@@ ine al@@ t@@ ars ; and I am left alone , and they seek my life .
but what sa@@ ith the answer of God unto him ? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men , who have not bowed the knee to the image of Ba@@ al .
even so then at this present time also there is a remn@@ ant according to the election of grace .
( according as it is written , God hath given them the spirit of sl@@ umber , eyes that they should not see , and ears that they should not hear ; ) unto this day .
I say then , Have they stum@@ bled that they should fall ? God forbid : but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Genti@@ les , for to provoke them to jealousy .
now if the fall of them be the riches of the world , and the diminishing of them the riches of the Genti@@ les ; how much more their fulness ?
for if the casting away of them be the reconc@@ iling of the world , what shall the receiving of them be , but life from the dead ?
well ; because of un@@ belief they were broken off , and thou stand@@ est by faith . be not high@@ minded , but fear :
behold therefore the goodness and severity of God : on them which fell , severity ; but toward thee , goodness , if thou continue in his goodness : otherwise thou also shalt be cut off .
and they also , if they abide not still in un@@ belief , shall be gra@@ ffed in : for God is able to Gra@@ ff them in again .
and so all Israel shall be saved : as it is written , There shall come out of Si@@ on the Deli@@ ver@@ er , and shall turn away un@@ god@@ liness from Jacob :
as concerning the gospel , they are enemies for your s@@ akes : but as touching the election , they are beloved for the fathers ' s@@ akes .
O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God ! how un@@ search@@ able are his judgments , and his ways past finding out !
I bes@@ e@@ ech you therefore , brethren , by the mer@@ cies of God , that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice , holy , acceptable unto God , which is your reasonable service .
and be not con@@ formed to this world : but be ye transformed by the renew@@ ing of your mind , that ye may prove what is that good , and acceptable , and perfect , will of God .
or he that ex@@ hor@@ t@@ eth , on ex@@ hor@@ tation : he that gi@@ v@@ eth , let him do it with simplicity ; he that rul@@ eth , with diligence ; he that sh@@ ew@@ eth mercy , with cheer@@ fulness .
dearly beloved , av@@ enge not yourselves , but rather give place unto wrath : for it is written , Ven@@ ge@@ ance is mine ; I will repay , sa@@ ith the Lord .
let every soul be subject unto the higher powers . for there is no power but of God : the powers that be are ordained of God .
wh@@ oso@@ ever therefore resist@@ eth the power , resist@@ eth the ordin@@ ance of God : and they that resist shall receive to themselves dam@@ nation .
for rulers are not a terror to good works , but to the evil . wil@@ t thou then not be afraid of the power ? do that which is good , and thou shalt have praise of the same :
for for this cause pay ye tribute also : for they are God 's ministers , attending continually upon this very thing .
but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ , and make not provision for the flesh , to fulfil the lu@@ sts thereof .
who art thou that jud@@ gest another man 's servant ? to his own master he stand@@ eth or fall@@ eth . ye@@ a , he shall be Hol@@ den up : for God is able to make him stand .
for whether we live , we live unto the Lord ; and whether we die , we die unto the Lord : whether we live therefore , or die , we are the Lord 's .
but why d@@ ost thou judge thy brother ? or why d@@ ost thou set at n@@ ought thy brother ? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ .
for it is written , As I live , sa@@ ith the Lord , every knee shall bow to me , and every tongue shall confess to God .
let us not therefore judge one another any more : but judge this rather , that no man put a stum@@ bl@@ ing@@ block or an occasion to fall in his brother 's way .
I know , and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus , that there is nothing un@@ clean of itself : but to him that este@@ em@@ eth any thing to be un@@ clean , to him it is un@@ clean .
for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink ; but righteousness , and peace , and joy in the Holy Ghost .
let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace , and things where@@ with one may edi@@ fy another .
for meat destroy not the work of God . all things indeed are pure ; but it is evil for that man who e@@ at@@ eth with offence .
for even Christ pleased not himself ; but , as it is written , The repro@@ aches of them that repro@@ ached thee fell on me .
that ye may with one mind and one mouth glori@@ fy God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circum@@ cision for the truth of God , to confirm the promises made unto the fathers :
now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that ye may abound in hope , through the power of the Holy Ghost .
and I myself also am persuaded of you , my brethren , that ye also are full of goodness , filled with all knowledge , able also to admon@@ ish one another .
that I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Genti@@ les , minist@@ ering the gospel of God , that the offering up of the Genti@@ les might be acceptable , being sancti@@ fied by the Holy Ghost .
for I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me , to make the Genti@@ les obedient , by word and deed ,
ye@@ a , so have I stri@@ ved to preach the gospel , not where Christ was named , lest I should build upon another man 's foundation :
it hath pleased them verily ; and their debtors they are . for if the Genti@@ les have been made part@@ akers of their spiritual things , their duty is also to minister unto them in car@@ nal things .
that ye receive her in the Lord , as becom@@ eth saints , and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you : for she hath been a succ@@ ou@@ rer of many , and of myself also .
sal@@ ute Andr@@ on@@ ic@@ us and Jun@@ ia , my kin@@ smen , and my fel@@ low@@ prisoners , who are of note among the apostles , who also were in Christ before me .
for they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ , but their own belly ; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple .
for your obedience is come abroad unto all men . I am glad therefore on your behalf : but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good , and simple concerning evil .
and the God of peace shall bru@@ ise Satan under your feet shortly . the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you . A@@ men .
Gai@@ us mine host , and of the whole church , sal@@ ut@@ eth you . E@@ ra@@ st@@ us the cham@@ ber@@ lain of the city sal@@ ut@@ eth you , and Qu@@ art@@ us a brother .
now to him that is of power to st@@ ablis@@ h you according to my gospel , and the preaching of Jesus Christ , according to the revelation of the mystery , which was kept secret since the world began ,
but now is made manifest , and by the scriptures of the prophets , according to the commandment of the everlasting God , made known to all nations for the obedience of faith :
unto the church of God which is at Cor@@ inth , to them that are sancti@@ fied in Christ Jesus , called to be saints , with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord , both theirs and ours :
now I bes@@ e@@ ech you , brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye all speak the same thing , and that there be no divisions among you ; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish fool@@ is@@ hness ; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God .
where is the wise ? where is the scri@@ be ? where is the dis@@ pu@@ ter of this world ? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world ?
for after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God , it pleased God by the fool@@ is@@ hness of preaching to save them that believe .
but unto them which are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ the power of God , and the wisdom of God .
and I , brethren , when I came to you , came not with excell@@ ency of speech or of wisdom , declaring unto you the testimony of God .
and my speech and my preaching was not with entic@@ ing words of man 's wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power :
but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery , even the hidden wisdom , which God ordained before the world unto our glory :
but as it is written , Eye hath not seen , nor ear heard , neither have entered into the heart of man , the things which God hath prepared for them that love him .
for what man know@@ eth the things of a man , save the spirit of man which is in him ? even so the things of God know@@ eth no man , but the Spirit of God .
which things also we speak , not in the words which man 's wisdom teach@@ eth , but which the Holy Ghost teach@@ eth ; comparing spiritual things with spiritual .
for who hath known the mind of the Lord , that he may instruct him ? but we have the mind of Christ .
for we are lab@@ our@@ ers together with God : ye are God 's hus@@ band@@ ry , ye are God 's building .
according to the grace of God which is given unto me , as a wise master@@ builder , I have laid the foundation , and another buil@@ det@@ h there@@ on . but let every man take heed how he buil@@ det@@ h there@@ upon .
if any man def@@ ile the temple of God , him shall God destroy ; for the temple of God is holy , which temple ye are .
for the wisdom of this world is fool@@ is@@ hness with God . for it is written , He tak@@ eth the wise in their own craft@@ iness .
but with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you , or of man 's judgment : ye@@ a , I judge not mine own self .
therefore judge nothing before the time , until the Lord come , who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness , and will make manifest the coun@@ sels of the hearts : and then shall every man have praise of God .
for who mak@@ eth thee to differ from another ? and what hast thou that thou did@@ st not receive ? now if thou did@@ st receive it , why d@@ ost thou glory , as if thou had@@ st not received it ?
for I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last , as it were appointed to death : for we are made a spectacle unto the world , and to angels , and to men .
we are fo@@ ols for Christ 's sake , but ye are wise in Christ ; we are weak , but ye are strong ; ye are hon@@ our@@ able , but we are desp@@ ised .
being defam@@ ed , we int@@ re@@ at : we are made as the fil@@ th of the world , and are the off@@ scour@@ ing of all things unto this day .
for though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ , yet have ye not many fathers : for in Christ Jesus I have be@@ gotten you through the gospel .
for this cause have I sent unto you Timo@@ the@@ us , who is my beloved son , and faithful in the Lord , who shall bring you into rem@@ embrance of my ways which be in Christ , as I teach every where in every church .
what will ye ? shall I come unto you with a rod , or in love , and in the spirit of me@@ ek@@ ness ?
for I verily , as absent in body , but present in spirit , have judged already , as though I were present , concerning him that hath so done this deed ,
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , when ye are gathered together , and my spirit , with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ ,
therefore let us keep the feast , not with old leav@@ en , neither with the leav@@ en of mal@@ ice and w@@ ick@@ edness ; but with the un@@ leav@@ ened bread of sincerity and truth .
yet not altogether with the for@@ nic@@ ators of this world , or with the co@@ vet@@ ous , or extor@@ tion@@ ers , or with id@@ ol@@ aters ; for then must ye needs go out of the world .
do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world ? and if the world shall be judged by you , are ye un@@ worthy to judge the smallest matters ?
if then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life , set them to judge who are least este@@ em@@ ed in the church .
know ye not that the un@@ righteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God ? be not deceived : neither for@@ nic@@ ators , nor id@@ ol@@ aters , nor adul@@ ter@@ ers , nor eff@@ em@@ inate , nor ab@@ users of themselves with mankind ,
and such were some of you : but ye are washed , but ye are sancti@@ fied , but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and by the Spirit of our God .
me@@ ats for the belly , and the belly for me@@ ats : but God shall destroy both it and them . now the body is not for for@@ n@@ ication , but for the Lord ; and the Lord for the body .
what ? know ye not that he which is joined to an har@@ lot is one body ? for two , sa@@ ith he , shall be one flesh .
what ? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you , which ye have of God , and ye are not your own ?
now concerning the things where@@ of ye wrote unto me : it is good for a man not to touch a woman .
nevertheless , to avoid for@@ n@@ ication , let every man have his own wife , and let every woman have her own husband .
def@@ ra@@ ud ye not one the other , except it be with consent for a time , that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer ; and come together again , that Satan temp@@ t you not for your in@@ contin@@ ency .
for I would that all men were even as I myself . but every man hath his proper gift of God , one after this manner , and another after that .
and unto the married I command , yet not I , but the Lord , Let not the wife depart from her husband :
but to the rest speak I , not the Lord : if any brother hath a wife that believ@@ eth not , and she be pleased to dwell with him , let him not put her away .
and the woman which hath an husband that believ@@ eth not , and if he be pleased to dwell with her , let her not leave him .
for the un@@ believing husband is sancti@@ fied by the wife , and the un@@ believing wife is sancti@@ fied by the husband : else were your children un@@ clean ; but now are they holy .
but if the un@@ believing depart , let him depart . a brother or a sister is not under bond@@ age in such cases : but God hath called us to peace .
for what know@@ est thou , O wife , whether thou shalt save thy husband ? or how know@@ est thou , O man , whether thou shalt save thy wife ?
but as God hath distributed to every man , as the Lord hath called every one , so let him walk . and so ord@@ ain I in all churches .
now concerning vir@@ gins I have no commandment of the Lord : yet I give my judgment , as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful .
art thou bound unto a wife ? seek not to be loos@@ ed . art thou loos@@ ed from a wife ? seek not a wife .
but and if thou marry , thou hast not sin@@ ned ; and if a virgin marry , she hath not sin@@ ned . nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh : but I spare you .
but this I say , brethren , the time is short : it remain@@ eth , that both they that have wives be as though they had none ;
and they that use this world , as not ab@@ using it : for the fashion of this world pass@@ eth away .
but he that is married care@@ th for the things that are of the world , how he may please his wife .
and this I speak for your own profit ; not that I may cast a sn@@ are upon you , but for that which is com@@ ely , and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction .
the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liv@@ eth ; but if her husband be dead , she is at liberty to be married to whom she will ; only in the Lord .
but to us there is but one God , the Father , of whom are all things , and we in him ; and one Lord Jesus Christ , by whom are all things , and we by him .
How@@ be@@ it there is not in every man that knowledge : for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol ; and their conscience being weak is de@@ filed .
but meat comm@@ en@@ det@@ h us not to God : for neither , if we eat , are we the better ; neither , if we eat not , are we the worse .
but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stum@@ bl@@ ing@@ block to them that are weak .
W@@ herefore , if meat make my brother to offend , I will eat no flesh while the world stand@@ eth , lest I make my brother to offend .
if I be not an apostle unto others , yet doub@@ tless I am to you : for the seal of mine apost@@ les@@ hip are ye in the Lord .
have we not power to lead about a sister , a wife , as well as other apostles , and as the brethren of the Lord , and C@@ ep@@ has ?
who go@@ eth a warfare any time at his own charges ? who plan@@ t@@ eth a viney@@ ard , and e@@ at@@ eth not of the fruit thereof ? or who feed@@ eth a flock , and e@@ at@@ eth not of the milk of the flock ?
or sa@@ ith he it altogether for our s@@ akes ? for our s@@ akes , no doubt , this is written : that he that pl@@ ow@@ eth should plo@@ w in hope ; and that he that thresh@@ eth in hope should be part@@ aker of his hope .
if others be part@@ akers of this power over you , are not we rather ? nevertheless we have not used this power ; but suffer all things , lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ .
but I have used none of these things : neither have I written these things , that it should be so done unto me : for it were better for me to die , than that any man should make my gl@@ or@@ ying void .
for though I preach the gospel , I have nothing to glory of : for necessity is laid upon me ; ye@@ a , w@@ oe is unto me , if I preach not the gospel !
for if I do this thing willingly , I have a reward : but if against my will , a dispens@@ ation of the gospel is committed unto me .
what is my reward then ? verily that , when I preach the gospel , I may make the gospel of Christ without charge , that I abuse not my power in the gospel .
to them that are without law , as without law , ( being not without law to God , but under the law to Christ , ) that I might gain them that are without law .
to the weak became I as weak , that I might gain the weak : I am made all things to all men , that I might by all means save some .
moreover , brethren , I would not that ye should be ignorant , how that all our fathers were under the cloud , and all passed through the sea ;
neither be ye id@@ ol@@ aters , as were some of them ; as it is written , The people sat down to eat and drink , and rose up to play .
now all these things happened unto them for ens@@ am@@ ples : and they are written for our admon@@ ition , upon whom the ends of the world are come .
the cup of blessing which we bless , is it not the communion of the blood of Christ ? the bread which we break , is it not the communion of the body of Christ ?
for we being many are one bread , and one body : for we are all part@@ akers of that one bread .
all things are lawful for me , but all things are not expedient : all things are lawful for me , but all things edi@@ fy not .
if any of them that believe not bid you to a feast , and ye be disposed to go ; whatsoever is set before you , eat , asking no question for conscience sake .
but if any man say unto you , This is offered in sacrifice unto idols , eat not for his sake that sh@@ ew@@ ed it , and for conscience sake : for the earth is the Lord 's , and the fulness thereof :
conscience , I say , not th@@ ine own , but of the other : for why is my liberty judged of another man 's conscience ?
now I praise you , brethren , that ye remember me in all things , and keep the ordin@@ ances , as I delivered them to you .
for if the woman be not covered , let her also be shor@@ n : but if it be a shame for a woman to be shor@@ n or sha@@ ven , let her be covered .
for a man indeed ought not to cover his head , for@@ as@@ much as he is the image and glory of God : but the woman is the glory of the man .
nevertheless neither is the man without the woman , neither the woman without the man , in the Lord .
but if a woman have long hair , it is a glory to her : for her hair is given her for a covering .
now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not , that ye come together not for the better , but for the worse .
for there must be also here@@ sies among you , that they which are approved may be made manifest among you .
and when he had given thanks , he brake it , and said , Take , eat : this is my body , which is broken for you : this do in rem@@ embrance of me .
after the same manner also he took the cup , when he had sup@@ ped , saying , This cup is the new testament in my blood : this do ye , as oft as ye drink it , in rem@@ embrance of me .
W@@ herefore wh@@ oso@@ ever shall eat this bread , and drink this cup of the Lord , un@@ worth@@ ily , shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord .
and if any man hunger , let him eat at home ; that ye come not together unto condemnation . and the rest will I set in order when I come .
W@@ herefore I give you to understand , that no man speaking by the Spirit of God call@@ eth Jesus accur@@ sed : and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord , but by the Holy Ghost .
if the whole body were an eye , where were the hearing ? if the whole were hearing , where were the sm@@ elling ?
but now hath God set the members every one of them in the body , as it hath pleased him .
and the eye C@@ AN@@ NOT say unto the hand , I have no need of thee : nor again the head to the feet , I have no need of you .
that there should be no sch@@ ism in the body ; but that the members should have the same care one for another .
though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels , and have not charity , I am become as sounding brass , or a tin@@ k@@ ling cy@@ mb@@ al .
and though I have the gift of prophecy , and understand all mysteries , and all knowledge ; and though I have all faith , so that I could remove mountains , and have not charity , I am nothing .
and though I best@@ ow all my goods to feed the poor , and though I give my body to be burned , and have not charity , it prof@@ it@@ eth me nothing .
charity suffer@@ eth long , and is kind ; charity envi@@ eth not ; charity v@@ aun@@ t@@ eth not itself , is not pu@@ ffed up ,
do@@ th not behave itself un@@ seem@@ ly , see@@ ket@@ h not her own , is not easily provoked , thin@@ ket@@ h no evil ;
when I was a child , I sp@@ ake as a child , I understood as a child , I thought as a child : but when I became a man , I put away chil@@ dish things .
so likewise ye , except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood , how shall it be known what is spoken ? for ye shall speak into the air .
there are , it may be , so many kinds of voices in the world , and none of them is without signific@@ ation .
yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding , that by my voice I might teach others also , than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue .
if therefore the whole church be come together into one place , and all speak with tongues , and there come in those that are un@@ learned , or un@@ believers , will they not say that ye are mad ?
but if all proph@@ esy , and there come in one that believ@@ eth not , or one un@@ learned , he is convinced of all , he is judged of all :
and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest ; and so falling down on his face he will worship God , and report that God is in you of a truth .
how is it then , brethren ? when ye come together , everyone of you hath a p@@ sal@@ m , hath a doctrine , hath a tongue , hath a revelation , hath an interpretation . let all things be done unto edi@@ fying .
if any man speak in an unknown tongue , let it be by two , or at the most by three , and that by course ; and let one interpret .
if any thing be revealed to another that sit@@ t@@ eth by , let the first hold his peace .
let your women keep silence in the churches : for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience , as also sa@@ ith the law .
and if they will learn any thing , let them ask their husbands at home : for it is a shame for women to speak in the church .
if any man think himself to be a prophet , or spiritual , let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord .
after that , he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once ; of whom the greater part remain unto this present , but some are fallen asleep .
but by the grace of God I am what I am : and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain ; but I lab@@ oured more ab@@ und@@ antly than they all : yet not I , but the grace of God which was with me .
but every man in his own order : Christ the fir@@ st@@ fruits ; afterward they that are Christ 's at his coming .
for he hath put all things under his feet . but when he sa@@ ith , all things are put under him , it is manifest that he is excep@@ ted , which did put all things under him .
else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead , if the dead rise not at all ? why are they then baptized for the dead ?
if after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , what advant@@ ag@@ eth it me , if the dead rise not ? let us eat and drink ; for to mor@@ row we die .
and that which thou s@@ ow@@ est , thou s@@ ow@@ est not that body that shall be , but bare grain , it may chance of wheat , or of some other grain :
all flesh is not the same flesh : but there is one kind of flesh of men , another flesh of beasts , another of f@@ ishes , and another of birds .
so also is the resurrection of the dead . it is s@@ own in corruption ; it is raised in in@@ corruption :
it is s@@ own in dis@@ honour ; it is raised in glory : it is s@@ own in weakness ; it is raised in power :
and so it is written , The first man Adam was made a living soul ; the last Adam was made a quick@@ ening spirit .
therefore , my beloved brethren , be ye st@@ ed@@ fast , un@@ mo@@ ve@@ able , always ab@@ ounding in the work of the Lord , for@@ as@@ much as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord .
and it may be that I will abide , ye@@ a , and winter with you , that ye may bring me on my journey whi@@ ther@@ soever I go .
as touching our brother A@@ pol@@ los , I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren : but his will was not at all to come at this time ; but he will come when he shall have convenient time .
I bes@@ e@@ ech you , brethren , ( ye know the house of Step@@ han@@ as , that it is the fir@@ st@@ fruits of Ac@@ ha@@ ia , and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints , )
the churches of Asia sal@@ ute you . Aqu@@ ila and P@@ ris@@ c@@ illa sal@@ ute you much in the Lord , with the church that is in their house .
who comfor@@ t@@ eth us in all our tribu@@ lation , that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble , by the comfort where@@ with we ourselves are comfor@@ ted of God .
ye also helping together by prayer for us , that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf .
for our rejo@@ icing is this , the testimony of our conscience , that in simplicity and go@@ dly sincerity , not with fl@@ esh@@ ly wisdom , but by the grace of God , we have had our conversation in the world , and more ab@@ und@@ antly to you @@@ -@@ @ ward .
and to pass by you into Macedonia , and to come again out of Macedonia unto you , and of you to be brought on my way toward Juda@@ ea .
for if I make you sorry , who is he then that mak@@ eth me glad , but the same which is made sorry by me ?
for to this end also did I write , that I might know the proof of you , whether ye be obedient in all things .
to whom ye forgive any thing , I forgive also : for if I for@@ gave any thing , to whom I for@@ gave it , for your s@@ akes for@@ gave I it in the person of Christ ;
furthermore , when I came to Tro@@ as to preach Christ 's gospel , and a door was opened unto me of the Lord ,
now thanks be unto God , which always caus@@ eth us to triumph in Christ , and mak@@ eth manifest the sav@@ our of his knowledge by us in every place .
to the one we are the sav@@ our of death unto death ; and to the other the sav@@ our of life unto life . and who is sufficient for these things ?
for we are not as many , which corrupt the word of God : but as of sincerity , but as of God , in the sight of God speak we in Christ .
for@@ as@@ much as ye are manifest@@ ly declared to be the epist@@ le of Christ minist@@ ered by us , written not with ink , but with the Spirit of the living God ; not in tables of stone , but in fl@@ esh@@ y tables of the heart .
who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament ; not of the letter , but of the spirit : for the letter kill@@ eth , but the spirit gi@@ v@@ eth life .
but if the ministr@@ ation of death , written and engra@@ ven in stones , was glorious , so that the children of Israel could not st@@ ed@@ fast@@ ly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his coun@@ tenance ; which glory was to be done away :
for if the ministr@@ ation of condemnation be glory , much more do@@ th the ministr@@ ation of righteousness exceed in glory .
for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect , by reason of the glory that excell@@ eth .
and not as Moses , which put a V@@ ail over his face , that the children of Israel could not st@@ ed@@ fast@@ ly look to the end of that which is abolished :
but their minds were blin@@ ded : for until this day remain@@ eth the same V@@ ail un@@ taken away in the reading of the old testament ; which V@@ ail is done away in Christ .
but we all , with open face be@@ holding as in a glass the glory of the Lord , are changed into the same image from glory to glory , even as by the Spirit of the Lord .
but have ren@@ ounced the hidden things of dis@@ honesty , not walking in craft@@ iness , nor handling the word of God dece@@ it@@ fully ; but by manifestation of the truth comm@@ ending ourselves to every man 's conscience in the sight of God .
in whom the god of this world hath blin@@ ded the minds of them which believe not , lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ , who is the image of God , should shine unto them .
but we have this treasure in ear@@ then vessels , that the excell@@ ency of the power may be of God , and not of us .
for we which live are al@@ way delivered unto death for Jesus ' sake , that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh .
we having the same spirit of faith , according as it is written , I believed , and therefore have I spoken ; we also believe , and therefore speak ;
knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus , and shall present us with you .
for all things are for your s@@ akes , that the abundant grace might through the thank@@ s@@ giving of many red@@ ound to the glory of God .
for we that are in this tab@@ ern@@ acle do gro@@ an , being burdened : not for that we would be un@@ clo@@ thed , but clo@@ thed upon , that mortality might be swallowed up of life .
for we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hath done , whether it be good or bad .
knowing therefore the terror of the Lord , we persuade men ; but we are made manifest unto God ; and I trust also are made manifest in your consci@@ ences .
for we comm@@ end not ourselves again unto you , but give you occasion to glory on our behalf , that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance , and not in heart .
for whether we be beside ourselves , it is to God : or whether we be sober , it is for your cause .
for the love of Christ constr@@ ain@@ eth us ; because we thus judge , that if one died for all , then were all dead :
and that he died for all , that they which live should not h@@ ence@@ forth live unto themselves , but unto him which died for them , and rose again .
W@@ herefore h@@ ence@@ forth know we no man after the flesh : ye@@ a , though we have known Christ after the flesh , yet now h@@ ence@@ forth know we him no more .
for he hath made him to be sin for us , who knew no sin ; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him .
now for a re@@ comp@@ ence in the same , ( I speak as unto my children , ) be ye also enlarged .
and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols ? for ye are the temple of the living God ; as God hath said , I will dwell in them , and walk in them ; and I will be their God , and they shall be my people .
W@@ herefore come out from among them , and be ye separate , sa@@ ith the Lord , and touch not the un@@ clean thing ; and I will receive you ,
having therefore these promises , dearly beloved , let us clean@@ se ourselves from all fil@@ thiness of the flesh and spirit , perf@@ ecting hol@@ iness in the fear of God .
great is my bold@@ ness of speech toward you , great is my gl@@ or@@ ying of you : I am filled with comfort , I am exceeding joyful in all our tribu@@ lation .
for though I made you sorry with a letter , I do not repent , though I did repent : for I perceive that the same epist@@ le hath made you sorry , though it were but for a season .
now I rejoice , not that ye were made sorry , but that ye sor@@ row@@ ed to repentance : for ye were made sorry after a go@@ dly manner , that ye might receive damage by us in nothing .
for go@@ dly sorrow work@@ eth repentance to salvation not to be rep@@ ented of : but the sorrow of the world work@@ eth death .
therefore we were comfor@@ ted in your comfort : ye@@ a , and exceedingly the more jo@@ yed we for the joy of Tit@@ us , because his spirit was refresh@@ ed by you all .
how that in a great trial of afflic@@ tion the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty ab@@ ounded unto the riches of their liber@@ ality .
therefore , as ye abound in every thing , in faith , and utter@@ ance , and knowledge , and in all diligence , and in your love to us , see that ye abound in this grace also .
I speak not by commandment , but by occasion of the for@@ wardness of others , and to prove the sincerity of your love .
for ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that , though he was rich , yet for your s@@ akes he became poor , that ye through his poverty might be rich .
and herein I give my advice : for this is expedient for you , who have begun before , not only to do , but also to be forward a year ago .
and we have sent with him the brother , whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches ;
providing for honest things , not only in the sight of the Lord , but also in the sight of men .
and we have sent with them our brother , whom we have of@@ ten@@ times proved dilig@@ ent in many things , but now much more dilig@@ ent , upon the great confidence which I have in you .
whether any do inqu@@ ire of Tit@@ us , he is my partner and fel@@ lo@@ whel@@ per concerning you : or our brethren be inqui@@ red of , they are the messengers of the churches , and the glory of Christ .
W@@ herefore sh@@ ew ye to them , and before the churches , the proof of your love , and of our bo@@ asting on your behalf .
for I know the for@@ wardness of your mind , for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia , that Ac@@ ha@@ ia was ready a year ago ; and your zeal hath provoked very many .
every man according as he purpos@@ eth in his heart , so let him give ; not grud@@ g@@ ingly , or of necessity : for God lov@@ eth a cheerful gi@@ ver .
for the administration of this service not only suppl@@ i@@ eth the want of the saints , but is abundant also by many thank@@ s@@ gi@@ vings unto God ;
wh@@ iles by the experiment of this ministr@@ ation they glori@@ fy God for your prof@@ essed subj@@ ection unto the gospel of Christ , and for your liberal distribution unto them , and unto all men ;
now I Paul myself bes@@ e@@ ech you by the me@@ ek@@ ness and gentl@@ eness of Christ , who in presence am base among you , but being absent am bold toward you :
but I bes@@ e@@ ech you , that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence , where@@ with I think to be bold against some , which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh .
( for the weapons of our warfare are not car@@ nal , but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds ; )
for we dare not make ourselves of the number , or compare ourselves with some that comm@@ end themselves : but they measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves among themselves , are not wise .
but we will not boast of things without our measure , but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us , a measure to reach even unto you .
for I am jeal@@ ous over you with go@@ dly jealousy : for I have esp@@ oused you to one husband , that I may present you as a cha@@ ste virgin to Christ .
but I fear , lest by any means , as the ser@@ pent be@@ gu@@ iled Eve through his sub@@ til@@ ty , so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ .
but though I be ru@@ de in speech , yet not in knowledge ; but we have been through@@ ly made manifest among you in all things .
are they He@@ bre@@ ws ? so am I. Are they Israel@@ ites ? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham ? so am I.
beside those things that are without , that which com@@ eth upon me daily , the care of all the churches .
it is not expedient for me doub@@ tless to glory . I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord .
I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago , ( whether in the body , I C@@ AN@@ NOT tell ; or whether out of the body , I C@@ AN@@ NOT tell : God know@@ eth ; ) such an one caught up to the third heaven .
and I knew such a man , ( whether in the body , or out of the body , I C@@ AN@@ NOT tell : God know@@ eth ; )
of such an one will I glory : yet of myself I will not glory , but in mine in@@ firm@@ ities .
for though I would desire to glory , I shall not be a fool ; for I will say the truth : but now I for@@ bear , lest any man should think of me above that which he se@@ eth me to be , or that he he@@ areth of me .
and lest , when I come again , my God will humble me among you , and that I shall be@@ w@@ ail many which have sin@@ ned already , and have not rep@@ ented of the un@@ clean@@ ness and for@@ n@@ ication and l@@ as@@ ci@@ vi@@ ousness which they have committed .
this is the third time I am coming to you . in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established .
I told you before , and fore@@ tell you , as if I were present , the second time ; and being absent now I write to them which her@@ et@@ o@@ fore have sin@@ ned , and to all other , that , if I come again , I will not spare :
for though he was cruci@@ fied through weakness , yet he liv@@ eth by the power of God . for we also are weak in him , but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you .
finally , brethren , farewell . be perfect , be of good comfort , be of one mind , live in peace ; and the God of love and peace shall be with you .
Paul , an apostle , ( not of men , neither by man , but by Jesus Christ , and God the Father , who raised him from the dead ; )
I mar@@ vel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel :
but though we , or an angel from heaven , preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you , let him be accur@@ sed .
as we said before , so say I now again , If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received , let him be accur@@ sed .
for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews ' religion , how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God , and wasted it :
but when it pleased God , who separated me from my mother 's womb , and called me by his grace ,
and when James , C@@ ep@@ has , and John , who seemed to be pillars , perceived the grace that was given unto me , they gave to me and Bar@@ nab@@ as the right hands of fellowship ; that we should go unto the he@@ a@@ then , and they unto the circum@@ cision .
for before that certain came from James , he did eat with the Genti@@ les : but when they were come , he withdrew and separated himself , fearing them which were of the circum@@ cision .
but if , while we seek to be justified by Christ , we ourselves also are found sinners , is therefore Christ the minister of sin ? God forbid .
I am cruci@@ fied with Christ : nevertheless I live ; yet not I , but Christ liv@@ eth in me : and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God , who loved me , and gave himself for me .
for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse : for it is written , Cur@@ sed is every one that continu@@ eth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them .
Christ hath re@@ deemed us from the curse of the law , being made a curse for us : for it is written , Cur@@ sed is every one that han@@ get@@ h on a tree :
and this I say , that the covenant , that was confirmed before of God in Christ , the law , which was four hundred and thirty years after , C@@ AN@@ NOT dis@@ ann@@ ul , that it should make the promise of none effect .
W@@ herefore then serv@@ eth the law ? it was added because of trans@@ gres@@ sions , till the seed should come to whom the promise was made ; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator .
is the law then against the promises of God ? God forbid : for if there had been a law given which could have given life , verily righteousness should have been by the law .
but the scrip@@ ture hath concluded all under sin , that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe .
W@@ herefore the law was our school@@ master to bring us unto Christ , that we might be justified by faith .
and if ye be Christ 's , then are ye Abraham 's seed , and heirs according to the promise .
now I say , That the heir , as long as he is a child , differ@@ eth nothing from a servant , though he be lord of all ;
they z@@ eal@@ ously affect you , but not well ; ye@@ a , they would exclude you , that ye might affect them .
for it is written , that Abraham had two sons , the one by a bond@@ maid , the other by a fre@@ ew@@ oman .
which things are an alleg@@ ory : for these are the two coven@@ ants ; the one from the mount Sinai , which gen@@ der@@ eth to bond@@ age , which is ag@@ ar .
for it is written , Re@@ jo@@ ice , thou bar@@ ren that be@@ arest not ; break forth and cry , thou that tr@@ avail@@ est not : for the des@@ ol@@ ate hath many more children than she which hath an husband .
nevertheless what sa@@ ith the scrip@@ ture ? cast out the bond@@ woman and her son : for the son of the bond@@ woman shall not be heir with the son of the fre@@ ew@@ oman .
so then , brethren , we are not children of the bond@@ woman , but of the free .
stand fast therefore in the liberty where@@ with Christ hath made us free , and be not ent@@ angled again with the y@@ oke of bond@@ age .
and I , brethren , if I yet preach circum@@ cision , why do I yet suffer persecution ? then is the offence of the cross ceased .
for all the law is fulfilled in one word , even in this ; Th@@ ou shalt love thy neighbour as thy@@ self .
this I say then , Wal@@ k in the Spirit , and ye shall not ful@@ ful the lust of the flesh .
for the flesh lu@@ st@@ eth against the Spirit , and the Spirit against the flesh : and these are contrary the one to the other : so that ye C@@ AN@@ NOT do the things that ye would .
now the works of the flesh are manifest , which are these ; Ad@@ ul@@ tery , for@@ n@@ ication , un@@ clean@@ ness , l@@ as@@ ci@@ vi@@ ousness ,
and let us not be weary in well doing : for in due season we shall reap , if we faint not .
as we have therefore opportunity , let us do good unto all men , especially unto them who are of the household of faith .
for neither they themselves who are circum@@ c@@ ised keep the law ; but desire to have you circum@@ c@@ ised , that they may glory in your flesh .
but God forbid that I should glory , save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ , by whom the world is cruci@@ fied unto me , and I unto the world .
and as many as walk according to this rule , peace be on them , and mercy , and upon the Israel of God .
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ :
according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world , that we should be holy and without blame before him in love :
in whom we have redemption through his blood , the forgiveness of sins , according to the riches of his grace ;
having made known unto us the mystery of his will , according to his good pleasure which he hath pur@@ posed in himself :
in whom also we have obtained an inheritance , being pre@@ dest@@ inated according to the purpose of him who work@@ eth all things after the counsel of his own will :
which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession , unto the praise of his glory .
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of glory , may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him :
the eyes of your understanding being enlightened ; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling , and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints ,
and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us@@ ward who believe , according to the working of his mighty power ,
far above all princip@@ ality , and power , and might , and dom@@ inion , and every name that is named , not only in this world , but also in that which is to come :
and hath put all things under his feet , and gave him to be the head over all things to the church ,
where@@ in in time past ye walked according to the course of this world , according to the prince of the power of the air , the spirit that now work@@ eth in the children of disobedience :
among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lu@@ sts of our flesh , fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind ; and were by nature the children of wrath , even as others .
even when we were dead in sins , hath quick@@ ened us together with Christ , ( by grace ye are saved ; )
that in the ages to come he might sh@@ ew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus .
for by grace are ye saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves : it is the gift of God :
for we are his work@@ manship , created in Christ Jesus unto good works , which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them .
W@@ herefore remember , that ye being in time past Genti@@ les in the flesh , who are called Un@@ circum@@ cision by that which is called the Cir@@ cum@@ cision in the flesh made by hands ;
that at that time ye were without Christ , being aliens from the common@@ wealth of Israel , and strangers from the coven@@ ants of promise , having no hope , and without God in the world :
for he is our peace , who hath made both one , and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us ;
having abolished in his flesh the enmity , even the law of commandments contained in ordin@@ ances ; for to make in himself of tw@@ ain one new man , so making peace ;
and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross , having sl@@ ain the enmity thereby :
and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone ;
if ye have heard of the dispens@@ ation of the grace of God which is given me to you@@ ward :
W@@ herefore he sa@@ ith , When he asc@@ ended up on high , he led cap@@ tivity captive , and gave gifts unto men .
and he gave some , apostles ; and some , prophets ; and some , evangel@@ ists ; and some , past@@ ors and teachers ;
from whom the whole body fit@@ ly joined together and comp@@ acted by that which every joint suppl@@ i@@ eth , according to the effec@@ tual working in the measure of every part , mak@@ eth increase of the body unto the edi@@ fying of itself in love .
this I say therefore , and testify in the Lord , that ye h@@ ence@@ forth walk not as other Genti@@ les walk , in the van@@ ity of their mind ,
having the understanding dark@@ ened , being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them , because of the blindness of their heart :
let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth , but that which is good to the use of edi@@ fying , that it may minister grace unto the hear@@ ers .
and gri@@ eve not the holy Spirit of God , whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption .
for this ye know , that no wh@@ ore@@ mon@@ ger , nor un@@ clean person , nor co@@ vet@@ ous man , who is an id@@ ol@@ ater , hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God .
let no man deceive you with vain words : for because of these things com@@ eth the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience .
for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall be joined unto his wife , and they two shall be one flesh .
nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself ; and the wife see that she reverence her husband .
and , ye fathers , provoke not your children to wrath : but bring them up in the nurture and admon@@ ition of the Lord .
servants , be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh , with fear and trembling , in sing@@ l@@ eness of your heart , as unto Christ ;
but that ye also may know my affairs , and how I do , Ty@@ ch@@ ic@@ us , a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord , shall make known to you all things :
peace be to the brethren , and love with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
Paul and Timo@@ the@@ us , the servants of Jesus Christ , to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philipp@@ i , with the bishops and de@@ ac@@ ons :
being confident of this very thing , that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ :
even as it is meet for me to think this of you all , because I have you in my heart ; in@@ as@@ much as both in my bonds , and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel , ye all are part@@ akers of my grace .
what then ? notwithstanding , every way , whether in pret@@ ence , or in truth , Christ is preached ; and I therein do rejoice , ye@@ a , and will rejoice .
for I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer , and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ,
according to my earnest expectation and my hope , that in nothing I shall be ashamed , but that with all bold@@ ness , as always , so now also Christ shall be magni@@ fied in my body , whether it be by life , or by death .
but if I live in the flesh , this is the fruit of my labour : yet what I shall choose I w@@ ot not .
for I am in a str@@ ait bet@@ wi@@ x@@ t two , having a desire to depart , and to be with Christ ; which is far better :
only let your conversation be as it becom@@ eth the gospel of Christ : that whether I come and see you , or else be absent , I may hear of your affairs , that ye stand fast in one spirit , with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel ;
look not every man on his own things , but every man also on the things of others .
who , being in the form of God , thought it not robbery to be equal with God :
but made himself of no reputation , and took upon him the form of a servant , and was made in the lik@@ eness of men :
W@@ herefore God also hath highly exalted him , and given him a name which is above every name :
that ye may be bl@@ am@@ eless and harmless , the sons of God , without rebu@@ ke , in the midst of a cro@@ oked and perverse nation , among whom ye shine as lights in the world ;
holding forth the word of life ; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ , that I have not run in vain , neither lab@@ oured in vain .
but I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timo@@ the@@ us shortly unto you , that I also may be of good comfort , when I know your state .
but ye know the proof of him , that , as a son with the father , he hath served with me in the gospel .
yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Ep@@ aph@@ ro@@ dit@@ us , my brother , and companion in labour , and fel@@ low@@ soldier , but your messenger , and he that minist@@ ered to my wants .
for indeed he was sick ni@@ gh unto death : but God had mercy on him ; and not on him only , but on me also , lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow .
I sent him therefore the more carefully , that , when ye see him again , ye may rejoice , and that I may be the less sor@@ row@@ ful .
finally , my brethren , rejoice in the Lord . to write the same things to you , to me indeed is not griev@@ ous , but for you it is safe .
for we are the circum@@ cision , which worship God in the spirit , and rejoice in Christ Jesus , and have no confidence in the flesh .
though I might also have confidence in the flesh . if any other man thin@@ ket@@ h that he hath where@@ of he might trust in the flesh , I more :
and be found in him , not having mine own righteousness , which is of the law , but that which is through the faith of Christ , the righteousness which is of God by faith :
that I may know him , and the power of his resurrection , and the fellowship of his sufferings , being made con@@ form@@ able unto his death ;
not as though I had already attained , either were already perfect : but I follow after , if that I may ap@@ preh@@ end that for which also I am ap@@ preh@@ ended of Christ Jesus .
let us therefore , as many as be perfect , be thus minded : and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded , God shall reveal even this unto you .
nevertheless , where@@ to we have already attained , let us walk by the same rule , let us mind the same thing .
( for many walk , of whom I have told you often , and now tell you even we@@ eping , that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ :
who shall change our v@@ ile body , that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body , according to the working whereby he is able even to sub@@ due all things unto himself .
therefore , my brethren dearly beloved and long@@ ed for , my joy and crown , so stand fast in the Lord , my dearly beloved .
those things , which ye have both learned , and received , and heard , and seen in me , do : and the God of peace shall be with you .
but I rejo@@ iced in the Lord greatly , that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again ; where@@ in ye were also careful , but ye lacked opportunity .
I know both how to be ab@@ ased , and I know how to abound : every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry , both to abound and to suffer need .
but I have all , and abound : I am full , having received of Ep@@ aph@@ ro@@ dit@@ us the things which were sent from you , an od@@ our of a sweet smell , a sacrifice acceptable , well@@ pleasing to God .
we give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , praying always for you ,
for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven , where@@ of ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel ;
which is come unto you , as it is in all the world ; and br@@ ing@@ eth forth fruit , as it do@@ th also in you , since the day ye heard of it , and knew the grace of God in truth :
for this cause we also , since the day we heard it , do not cease to pray for you , and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding ;
for by him were all things created , that are in heaven , and that are in earth , visible and invisible , whether they be thr@@ ones , or dom@@ ini@@ ons , or princip@@ alities , or powers : all things were created by him , and for him :
and you , that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works , yet now hath he reconciled
if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled , and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel , which ye have heard , and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven ; where@@ of I Paul am made a minister ;
to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Genti@@ les ; which is Christ in you , the hope of glory :
whom we preach , warning every man , and teaching every man in all wisdom ; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus :
for though I be absent in the flesh , yet am I with you in the spirit , jo@@ ying and be@@ holding your order , and the st@@ ed@@ fast@@ ness of your faith in Christ .
buried with him in baptism , where@@ in also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God , who hath raised him from the dead .
Blo@@ tting out the hand@@ writing of ordin@@ ances that was against us , which was contrary to us , and took it out of the way , n@@ ailing it to his cross ;
let no man therefore judge you in meat , or in drink , or in respect of an hol@@ y@@ day , or of the new moon , or of the sab@@ bath days :
let no man be@@ gu@@ ile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and wor@@ shipping of angels , intru@@ ding into those things which he hath not seen , v@@ ain@@ ly pu@@ ffed up by his fl@@ esh@@ ly mind ,
and not holding the Head , from which all the body by joints and bands having nour@@ ishment minist@@ ered , and knit together , increas@@ eth with the increase of God .
W@@ herefore if ye be dead with Christ from the ru@@ di@@ ments of the world , why , as though living in the world , are ye subject to ordin@@ ances ,
if ye then be risen with Christ , seek those things which are above , where Christ sit@@ t@@ eth on the right hand of God .
but now ye also put off all these ; anger , wrath , mal@@ ice , bl@@ asph@@ emy , fil@@ thy communication out of your mouth .
put on therefore , as the elect of God , holy and beloved , bow@@ els of mer@@ cies , kindness , hum@@ bl@@ eness of mind , me@@ ek@@ ness , long@@ suffering ;
for@@ bearing one another , and for@@ giving one another , if any man have a quarrel against any : even as Christ for@@ gave you , so also do ye .
but he that do@@ eth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done : and there is no respect of persons .
with@@ al praying also for us , that God would open unto us a door of utter@@ ance , to speak the mystery of Christ , for which I am also in bonds :
let your speech be al@@ way with grace , seas@@ oned with salt , that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man .
all my state shall Ty@@ ch@@ ic@@ us declare unto you , who is a beloved brother , and a faithful minister and fel@@ low@@ servant in the Lord :
with One@@ sim@@ us , a faithful and beloved brother , who is one of you . they shall make known unto you all things which are done here .
Ep@@ aphr@@ as , who is one of you , a servant of Christ , sal@@ ut@@ eth you , always lab@@ ouring ferv@@ ently for you in prayers , that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God .
for I bear him record , that he hath a great zeal for you , and them that are in La@@ o@@ dic@@ ea , and them in Hier@@ apolis .
and say to Archi@@ pp@@ us , Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord , that thou fulfil it .
and ye became followers of us , and of the Lord , having received the word in much afflic@@ tion , with joy of the Holy Ghost :
for from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Ac@@ ha@@ ia , but also in every place your faith to God @@@ -@@ @ ward is spread abroad ; so that we need not to speak any thing .
and to wait for his Son from heaven , whom he raised from the dead , even Jesus , which delivered us from the wrath to come .
but even after that we had suffered before , and were sham@@ efully entre@@ ated , as ye know , at Philipp@@ i , we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention .
so being aff@@ ection@@ ately desir@@ ous of you , we were willing to have im@@ parted unto you , not the gospel of God only , but also our own souls , because ye were dear unto us .
for ye remember , brethren , our labour and trav@@ ail : for lab@@ ouring night and day , because we would not be chargeable unto any of you , we preached unto you the gospel of God .
for ye , brethren , became followers of the churches of God which in Juda@@ ea are in Christ Jesus : for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen , even as they have of the Jews :
who both killed the Lord Jesus , and their own prophets , and have persecuted us ; and they please not God , and are contrary to all men :
and sent Timo@@ the@@ us , our brother , and minister of God , and our fel@@ low@@ lab@@ ou@@ rer in the gospel of Christ , to establish you , and to comfort you concerning your faith :
for this cause , when I could no longer for@@ bear , I sent to know your faith , lest by some means the temp@@ ter have tempted you , and our labour be in vain .
and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we do toward you :
to the end he may st@@ ablis@@ h your hearts un@@ bl@@ ame@@ able in hol@@ iness before God , even our Father , at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints .
furthermore then we bes@@ e@@ ech you , brethren , and ex@@ h@@ ort you by the Lord Jesus , that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God , so ye would abound more and more .
for this is the will of God , even your sanc@@ tification , that ye should abst@@ ain from for@@ n@@ ication :
but as touching bro@@ ther@@ ly love ye need not that I write unto you : for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another .
and indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia : but we bes@@ e@@ ech you , brethren , that ye increase more and more ;
for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the ar@@ chang@@ el , and with the trump of God : and the dead in Christ shall rise first :
then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds , to meet the Lord in the air : and so shall we ever be with the Lord .
ye are all the children of light , and the children of the day : we are not of the night , nor of darkness .
but let us , who are of the day , be sober , putting on the breast@@ plate of faith and love ; and for an helmet , the hope of salvation .
and we bes@@ e@@ ech you , brethren , to know them which labour among you , and are over you in the Lord , and admon@@ ish you ;
now we ex@@ h@@ ort you , brethren , warn them that are un@@ ru@@ ly , comfort the fee@@ bl@@ emin@@ ded , support the weak , be patient toward all men .
see that none render evil for evil unto any man ; but ever follow that which is good , both among yourselves , and to all men .
Paul , and Sil@@ van@@ us , and Timo@@ the@@ us , unto the church of the Thess@@ al@@ onians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ :
we are bound to thank God always for you , brethren , as it is meet , because that your faith grow@@ eth exceedingly , and the charity of every one of you all toward each other ab@@ oun@@ det@@ h ;
which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God , that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God , for which ye also suffer :
in fl@@ aming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God , and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ :
who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord , and from the glory of his power ;
when he shall come to be glori@@ fied in his saints , and to be admired in all them that believe ( because our testimony among you was believed ) in that day .
W@@ herefore also we pray always for you , that our God would count you worthy of this calling , and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness , and the work of faith with power :
now we bes@@ e@@ ech you , brethren , by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , and by our gathering together unto him ,
that ye be not soon shaken in mind , or be troubled , neither by spirit , nor by word , nor by letter as from us , as that the day of Christ is at hand .
let no man deceive you by any means : for that day shall not come , except there come a falling away first , and that man of sin be revealed , the son of per@@ dition ;
who oppos@@ eth and exal@@ t@@ eth himself above all that is called God , or that is wor@@ shipped ; so that he as God sit@@ t@@ eth in the temple of God , sh@@ ew@@ ing himself that he is God .
and with all decei@@ v@@ abl@@ eness of un@@ righteousness in them that perish ; because they received not the love of the truth , that they might be saved .
but we are bound to give thanks al@@ way to God for you , brethren beloved of the Lord , because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanc@@ tification of the Spirit and belief of the truth :
therefore , brethren , stand fast , and hold the traditions which ye have been taught , whether by word , or our epist@@ le .
now our Lord Jesus Christ himself , and God , even our Father , which hath loved us , and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace ,
and the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God , and into the patient waiting for Christ .
now we command you , brethren , in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that wal@@ ket@@ h disorderly , and not after the tradition which he received of us .
neither did we eat any man 's bread for n@@ ought ; but wrought with labour and trav@@ ail night and day , that we might not be chargeable to any of you :
now them that are such we command and ex@@ h@@ ort by our Lord Jesus Christ , that with qui@@ et@@ ness they work , and eat their own bread .
as I bes@@ ought thee to abide still at E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , when I went into Macedonia , that thou mi@@ gh@@ test charge some that they teach no other doctrine ,
neither give heed to f@@ ables and endless gene@@ alo@@ gies , which minister questions , rather than go@@ dly edi@@ fying which is in faith : so do .
knowing this , that the law is not made for a righteous man , but for the law@@ less and dis@@ obedient , for the un@@ go@@ dly and for sinners , for un@@ holy and prof@@ ane , for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers , for man@@ s@@ layers ,
for wh@@ ore@@ mon@@ gers , for them that def@@ ile themselves with mankind , for men@@ ste@@ al@@ ers , for li@@ ars , for per@@ jured persons , and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine ;
this is a faithful saying , and worthy of all accept@@ ation , that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners ; of whom I am chief .
of whom is Hy@@ men@@ a@@ eus and Alexander ; whom I have delivered unto Satan , that they may learn not to bl@@ asph@@ eme .
for kings , and for all that are in authority ; that we may lead a quiet and peace@@ able life in all god@@ liness and honesty .
W@@ here@@ unto I am ordained a preacher , and an apostle , ( I speak the truth in Christ , and lie not ; ) a teacher of the Genti@@ les in faith and ver@@ ity .
but I suffer not a woman to teach , nor to usur@@ p authority over the man , but to be in silence .
a bishop then must be bl@@ am@@ eless , the husband of one wife , vigilant , sober , of good behaviour , given to hospitality , apt to teach ;
moreover he must have a good report of them which are without ; lest he fall into repro@@ ach and the sn@@ are of the devil .
and let these also first be proved ; then let them use the office of a de@@ acon , being found bl@@ am@@ eless .
but if I tar@@ ry long , that thou may@@ est know how thou ough@@ test to behave thy@@ self in the house of God , which is the church of the living God , the pillar and ground of the truth .
and without controversy great is the mystery of god@@ liness : God was manifest in the flesh , justified in the Spirit , seen of angels , preached unto the Genti@@ les , believed on in the world , received up into glory .
now the Spirit spe@@ ak@@ eth expressly , that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith , giving heed to seduc@@ ing spirits , and doctrines of dev@@ ils ;
forbid@@ ding to marry , and commanding to abst@@ ain from me@@ ats , which God hath created to be received with thank@@ s@@ giving of them which believe and know the truth .
for every creature of God is good , and nothing to be refused , if it be received with thank@@ s@@ giving :
neglect not the gift that is in thee , which was given thee by prophecy , with the laying on of the hands of the pres@@ by@@ tery .
take heed unto thy@@ self , and unto the doctrine ; continue in them : for in doing this thou shalt both save thy@@ self , and them that hear thee .
but if any widow have children or ne@@ phe@@ ws , let them learn first to sh@@ ew pi@@ ety at home , and to requ@@ ite their parents : for that is good and acceptable before God .
now she that is a widow indeed , and des@@ ol@@ ate , trust@@ eth in God , and continu@@ eth in suppl@@ ications and prayers night and day .
let not a widow be taken into the number under thre@@ es@@ core years old , having been the wife of one man ,
if any man or woman that believ@@ eth have wid@@ ows , let them relieve them , and let not the church be charged ; that it may relieve them that are wid@@ ows indeed .
for the scrip@@ ture sa@@ ith , Th@@ ou shalt not mu@@ zzle the ox that t@@ read@@ eth out the corn . and , The lab@@ ou@@ rer is worthy of his reward .
I charge thee before God , and the Lord Jesus Christ , and the elect angels , that thou observe these things without prefer@@ ring one before another , doing nothing by partiality .
some men 's sins are open beforehand , going before to judgment ; and some men they follow after .
let as many servants as are under the y@@ oke count their own masters worthy of all honour , that the name of God and his doctrine be not bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed .
fight the good fight of faith , lay hold on eternal life , where@@ unto thou art also called , and hast prof@@ essed a good profession before many witnesses .
I give thee charge in the sight of God , who quick@@ en@@ eth all things , and before Christ Jesus , who before Pon@@ ti@@ us Pil@@ ate witnessed a good confession ;
who only hath immortality , dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto ; whom no man hath seen , nor can see : to whom be honour and power everlasting . A@@ men .
I thank God , whom I serve from my fore@@ fathers with pure conscience , that without c@@ easing I have rem@@ embrance of thee in my prayers night and day ;
when I call to rem@@ embrance the un@@ fe@@ igned faith that is in thee , which d@@ wel@@ t first in thy grandmother Lo@@ is , and thy mother E@@ un@@ ice ; and I am persuaded that in thee also .
who hath saved us , and called us with an holy calling , not according to our works , but according to his own purpose and grace , which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began ,
for the which cause I also suffer these things : nevertheless I am not ashamed : for I know whom I have believed , and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day .
hold fast the form of sound words , which thou hast heard of me , in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
this thou know@@ est , that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me ; of whom are Phy@@ g@@ ell@@ us and Her@@ mo@@ genes .
the Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day : and in how many things he minist@@ ered unto me at E@@ ph@@ es@@ us , thou know@@ est very well .
and the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses , the same commit thou to faithful men , who shall be able to teach others also .
where@@ in I suffer trouble , as an evil do@@ er , even unto bonds ; but the word of God is not bound .
therefore I endure all things for the elect 's s@@ akes , that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory .
it is a faithful saying : for if we be dead with him , we shall also live with him :
of these things put them in rem@@ embrance , charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit , but to the subver@@ ting of the hear@@ ers .
if a man therefore purge himself from these , he shall be a vessel unto honour , sancti@@ fied , and meet for the master 's use , and prepared unto every good work .
flee also youthful lu@@ sts : but follow righteousness , faith , charity , peace , with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart .
and the servant of the Lord must not strive ; but be gentle unto all men , apt to teach , patient ,
in me@@ ek@@ ness instruc@@ ting those that oppose themselves ; if God per@@ adventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth ;
persec@@ utions , afflic@@ tions , which came unto me at Anti@@ o@@ ch , at I@@ con@@ ium , at Ly@@ stra ; what persec@@ utions I endured : but out of them all the Lord delivered me .
and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures , which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus .
all scrip@@ ture is given by inspiration of God , and is profitable for doctrine , for re@@ proof , for correction , for instruction in righteousness :
but watch thou in all things , endure afflic@@ tions , do the work of an evangel@@ ist , make full proof of thy ministry .
h@@ ence@@ forth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness , which the Lord , the righteous judge , shall give me at that day : and not to me only , but unto all them also that love his appearing .
the clo@@ ke that I left at Tro@@ as with Car@@ pus , when thou com@@ est , bring with thee , and the books , but especially the par@@ ch@@ ments .
at my first answer no man stood with me , but all men for@@ s@@ ook me : I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge .
and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work , and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom : to whom be glory for ever and ever . A@@ men .
to Tit@@ us , mine own son after the common faith : grace , mercy , and peace , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour .
for this cause left I thee in Crete , that thou shoul@@ dest set in order the things that are wanting , and ord@@ ain elders in every city , as I had appointed thee :
for a bishop must be bl@@ am@@ eless , as the ste@@ ward of God ; not self@@ w@@ illed , not soon angry , not given to wine , no stri@@ ker , not given to fil@@ thy luc@@ re ;
but a lover of hospitality , a lover of good men , sober , just , holy , temper@@ ate ;
holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught , that he may be able by sound doctrine both to ex@@ h@@ ort and to convince the g@@ ain@@ say@@ ers .
not giving heed to Jewish f@@ ables , and commandments of men , that turn from the truth .
unto the pure all things are pure : but unto them that are de@@ filed and un@@ believing is nothing pure ; but even their mind and conscience is de@@ filed .
looking for that blessed hope , and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ ;
not by works of righteousness which we have done , but according to his mercy he saved us , by the washing of regeneration , and renew@@ ing of the Holy Ghost ;
that being justified by his grace , we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life .
this is a faithful saying , and these things I will that thou affirm constantly , that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works . these things are good and profitable unto men .
when I shall send Ar@@ tem@@ as unto thee , or Ty@@ ch@@ ic@@ us , be dilig@@ ent to come unto me to Nic@@ opol@@ is : for I have determined there to winter .
Paul , a prisoner of Jesus Christ , and Timothy our brother , unto Phil@@ emon our dearly beloved , and fel@@ low@@ lab@@ ou@@ rer ,
that the communication of thy faith may become effec@@ tual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus .
yet for love 's sake I rather bes@@ e@@ ech thee , being such an one as Paul the aged , and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ .
whom I would have retained with me , that in thy stead he might have minist@@ ered unto me in the bonds of the gospel :
not now as a servant , but above a servant , a brother beloved , specially to me , but how much more unto thee , both in the flesh , and in the Lord ?
I Paul have written it with mine own hand , I will repay it : albeit I do not say to thee how thou ow@@ est unto me even th@@ ine own self besides .
hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son , whom he hath appointed heir of all things , by whom also he made the worlds ;
for unto which of the angels said he at any time , Th@@ ou art my Son , this day have I be@@ gotten thee ? and again , I will be to him a Father , and he shall be to me a Son ?
and again , when he br@@ ing@@ eth in the fir@@ st@@ be@@ gotten into the world , he sa@@ ith , And let all the angels of God worship him .
and of the angels he sa@@ ith , Who mak@@ eth his angels spirits , and his ministers a flame of fire .
but unto the Son he sa@@ ith , Th@@ y throne , O God , is for ever and ever : a scep@@ tre of righteousness is the scep@@ tre of thy kingdom .
thou hast loved righteousness , and hated ini@@ qu@@ ity ; therefore God , even thy God , hath ano@@ inted thee with the oil of gl@@ ad@@ ness above thy fellows .
and , Th@@ ou , Lord , in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth ; and the heavens are the works of th@@ ine hands :
and as a vest@@ ure shalt thou fold them up , and they shall be changed : but thou art the same , and thy years shall not fail .
but to which of the angels said he at any time , S@@ it on my right hand , until I make th@@ ine enemies thy foot@@ stool ?
but one in a certain place testified , saying , What is man , that thou art mindful of him ? or the son of man , that thou vis@@ it@@ est him ?
thou mad@@ est him a little lower than the angels ; thou crow@@ ne@@ d@@ st him with glory and honour , and did@@ st set him over the works of thy hands :
thou hast put all things in subj@@ ection under his feet . for in that he put all in subj@@ ection under him , he left nothing that is not put under him . but now we see not yet all things put under him .
but we see Jesus , who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death , crowned with glory and honour ; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man .
for it became him , for whom are all things , and by whom are all things , in bringing many sons unto glory , to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
for both he that sancti@@ fi@@ eth and they who are sancti@@ fied are all of one : for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren ,
who was faithful to him that appointed him , as also Moses was faithful in all his house .
and Moses verily was faithful in all his house , as a servant , for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after ;
W@@ herefore I was griev@@ ed with that generation , and said , They do al@@ way er@@ r in their heart ; and they have not known my ways .
for we are made part@@ akers of Christ , if we hold the beginning of our confidence st@@ ed@@ fast unto the end ;
for some , when they had heard , did provoke : How@@ be@@ it not all that came out of Egypt by Moses .
but with whom was he griev@@ ed forty years ? was it not with them that had sin@@ ned , whose car@@ cases fell in the wilderness ?
let us therefore fear , lest , a promise being left us of entering into his rest , any of you should seem to come short of it .
for unto us was the gospel preached , as well as unto them : but the word preached did not profit them , not being mixed with faith in them that heard it .
for he sp@@ ake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise , And God did rest the seventh day from all his works .
let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace , that we may obtain mercy , and find grace to help in time of need .
for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God , that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins :
as he sa@@ ith also in another place , Th@@ ou art a priest for ever after the order of Mel@@ ch@@ ise@@ dec .
for when for the time ye ought to be teachers , ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the or@@ acles of God ; and are become such as have need of milk , and not of strong meat .
therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ , let us go on unto perfection ; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works , and of faith toward God ,
for the earth which drin@@ ket@@ h in the rain that com@@ eth oft upon it , and br@@ ing@@ eth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed , recei@@ v@@ eth blessing from God :
but that which be@@ areth thor@@ ns and bri@@ ers is rejected , and is ni@@ gh unto cur@@ sing ; whose end is to be burned .
for God is not un@@ righteous to forget your work and labour of love , which ye have sh@@ ew@@ ed toward his name , in that ye have minist@@ ered to the saints , and do minister .
where@@ in God , willing more ab@@ und@@ antly to sh@@ ew unto the heirs of promise the im@@ mut@@ ability of his counsel , confirmed it by an oath :
which hope we have as an anchor of the soul , both sure and st@@ ed@@ fast , and which enter@@ eth into that within the veil ;
for this Mel@@ ch@@ ise@@ dec , king of Sal@@ em , priest of the most high God , who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings , and blessed him ;
without father , without mother , without descent , having neither beginning of days , nor end of life ; but made like unto the Son of God ; ab@@ id@@ eth a priest continually .
if therefore perfection were by the Lev@@ itical priesthood , ( for under it the people received the law , ) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Mel@@ ch@@ ise@@ dec , and not be called after the order of Aaron ?
for the law made nothing perfect , but the bringing in of a better hope did ; by the which we draw ni@@ gh unto God .
( for those priests were made without an oath ; but this with an oath by him that said unto him , The Lord sw@@ are and will not repent , Th@@ ou art a priest for ever after the order of Mel@@ ch@@ ise@@ dec : )
W@@ herefore he is able also to save them to the utter@@ most that come unto God by him , seeing he ever liv@@ eth to make interc@@ ession for them .
who need@@ eth not daily , as those high priests , to offer up sacrifice , first for his own sins , and then for the people 's : for this he did once , when he offered up himself .
for the law mak@@ eth men high priests which have in@@ firm@@ ity ; but the word of the oath , which was since the law , mak@@ eth the Son , who is consec@@ rated for ever@@ more .
who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things , as Moses was admon@@ ished of God when he was about to make the tab@@ ern@@ acle : for , See , sa@@ ith he , that thou make all things according to the pattern sh@@ ew@@ ed to thee in the mount .
but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry , by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant , which was established upon better promises .
for finding fault with them , he sa@@ ith , Be@@ hold , the days come , sa@@ ith the Lord , when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Jud@@ ah :
for this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , sa@@ ith the Lord ; I will put my laws into their mind , and write them in their hearts : and I will be to them a God , and they shall be to me a people :
but into the second went the high priest alone once every year , not without blood , which he offered for himself , and for the errors of the people :
neither by the blood of goats and cal@@ ves , but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place , having obtained eternal redemption for us .
for if the blood of bul@@ ls and of goats , and the ashes of an hei@@ fer sprink@@ ling the un@@ clean , sancti@@ fi@@ eth to the puri@@ fying of the flesh :
and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament , that by means of death , for the redemption of the trans@@ gres@@ sions that were under the first testament , they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance .
for a testament is of force after men are dead : otherwise it is of no strength at all while the test@@ ator liv@@ eth .
for when Moses had spoken every prec@@ ept to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of cal@@ ves and of goats , with water , and scar@@ let wool , and h@@ ys@@ so@@ p , and sprink@@ led both the book , and all the people ,
for Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands , which are the figures of the true ; but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us :
for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself .
for the law having a shadow of good things to come , and not the very image of the things , can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the com@@ ers there@@ unto perfect .
then said I , L@@ o , I come ( in the volume of the book it is written of me , ) to do thy will , O God .
then said he , L@@ o , I come to do thy will , O God . he tak@@ eth away the first , that he may establish the second .
this is the covenant that I will make with them after those days , sa@@ ith the Lord , I will put my laws into their hearts , and in their minds will I write them ;
let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith , having our hearts sprink@@ led from an evil conscience , and our bodies washed with pure water .
but call to rem@@ embrance the former days , in which , after ye were illuminated , ye endured a great fight of afflic@@ tions ;
for ye had compassion of me in my bonds , and took joy@@ fully the spo@@ iling of your goods , knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance .
now the just shall live by faith : but if any man draw back , my soul shall have no pleasure in him .
but we are not of them who draw back unto per@@ dition ; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul .
but without faith it is impossible to please him : for he that com@@ eth to God must believe that he is , and that he is a re@@ war@@ der of them that dilig@@ ently seek him .
by faith Noah , being warned of God of things not seen as yet , moved with fear , prepared an ark to the saving of his house ; by the which he condemned the world , and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith .
by faith he so@@ jour@@ ned in the land of promise , as in a strange country , dwelling in tab@@ ern@@ acles with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise :
therefore sprang there even of one , and him as good as dead , so many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable .
these all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them af@@ ar off , and were persuaded of them , and embraced them , and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
and truly , if they had been mindful of that country from wh@@ ence they came out , they might have had opportunity to have returned .
but now they desire a better country , that is , an heavenly : W@@ herefore God is not ashamed to be called their God : for he hath prepared for them a city .
accounting that God was able to raise him up , even from the dead ; from wh@@ ence also he received him in a figure .
by faith Moses , when he was born , was hid three months of his parents , because they saw he was a proper child ; and they were not afraid of the king 's commandment .
and what shall I more say ? for the time would fail me to tell of Ge@@ de@@ on , and of Bar@@ ak , and of Sam@@ son , and of J@@ eph@@ th@@ ae ; of David also , and Samuel , and of the prophets :
women received their dead raised to life again : and others were tortured , not accepting deliver@@ ance ; that they might obtain a better resurrection :
and others had trial of cruel mock@@ ings and scour@@ g@@ ings , ye@@ a , moreover of bonds and imprisonment :
they were st@@ oned , they were s@@ awn as@@ under , were tempted , were sl@@ ain with the sword : they wan@@ dered about in she@@ ep@@ skins and go@@ at@@ skins ; being des@@ tit@@ ute , afflicted , tor@@ m@@ ented ;
( of whom the world was not worthy : ) they wan@@ dered in deserts , and in mountains , and in dens and caves of the earth .
and ye have forgotten the ex@@ hor@@ tation which spe@@ ak@@ eth unto you as unto children , My son , desp@@ ise not thou the cha@@ st@@ ening of the Lord , nor faint when thou art rebu@@ ked of him :
furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us , and we gave them reverence : shall we not much rather be in subj@@ ection unto the Father of spirits , and live ?
for they verily for a few days cha@@ st@@ ened us after their own pleasure ; but he for our profit , that we might be part@@ akers of his hol@@ iness .
now no cha@@ st@@ ening for the present seem@@ eth to be joy@@ ous , but griev@@ ous : nevertheless afterward it yiel@@ det@@ h the peace@@ able fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby .
and the sound of a trum@@ pet , and the voice of words ; which voice they that heard int@@ re@@ ated that the word should not be spoken to them any more :
( for they could not endure that which was commanded , And if so much as a beast touch the mountain , it shall be st@@ oned , or thrust through with a d@@ art :
to the general assembly and church of the fir@@ st@@ born , which are written in heaven , and to God the Judge of all , and to the spirits of just men made perfect ,
and to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant , and to the blood of sprink@@ ling , that spe@@ ak@@ eth better things than that of A@@ bel .
whose voice then shook the earth : but now he hath promised , saying , Y@@ et once more I shake not the earth only , but also heaven .
let your conversation be without co@@ vet@@ ousness ; and be content with such things as ye have : for he hath said , I will never leave thee , nor for@@ sake thee .
so that we may boldly say , The Lord is my hel@@ per , and I will not fear what man shall do unto me .
remember them which have the rule over you , who have spoken unto you the word of God : whose faith follow , considering the end of their conversation .
for the bodies of those beasts , whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin , are burned without the camp .
W@@ herefore Jesus also , that he might sancti@@ fy the people with his own blood , suffered without the gate .
by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually , that is , the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name .
but to do good and to communicate forget not : for with such sacrifices God is well pleased .
obey them that have the rule over you , and submit yourselves : for they watch for your souls , as they that must give account , that they may do it with joy , and not with grief : for that is unprofitable for you .
now the God of peace , that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus , that great shepherd of the sheep , through the blood of the everlasting covenant ,
make you perfect in every good work to do his will , working in you that which is well@@ pleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ ; to whom be glory for ever and ever . A@@ men .
but the rich , in that he is made low : because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away .
blessed is the man that endu@@ re@@ th temptation : for when he is tried , he shall receive the crown of life , which the Lord hath promised to them that love him .
let no man say when he is tempted , I am tempted of God : for God C@@ AN@@ NOT be tempted with evil , neither temp@@ t@@ eth he any man :
every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , and com@@ eth down from the Father of lights , with whom is no vari@@ abl@@ eness , neither shadow of turning .
W@@ herefore lay apart all fil@@ thiness and super@@ flu@@ ity of n@@ au@@ ght@@ iness , and receive with me@@ ek@@ ness the engra@@ fted word , which is able to save your souls .
for if any be a he@@ arer of the word , and not a do@@ er , he is like unto a man be@@ holding his natural face in a glass :
for if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring , in goo@@ dly app@@ arel , and there come in also a poor man in v@@ ile ra@@ iment ;
and ye have respect to him that we@@ areth the gay clothing , and say unto him , S@@ it thou here in a good place ; and say to the poor , Stand thou there , or sit here under my foot@@ stool :
hear@@ ken , my beloved brethren , H@@ ath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith , and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him ?
for he that said , Do not commit adul@@ tery , said also , Do not kill . now if thou commit no adul@@ tery , yet if thou kill , thou art become a trans@@ gres@@ sor of the law .
so speak ye , and so do , as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty .
and one of you say unto them , De@@ part in peace , be ye war@@ med and filled ; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are need@@ ful to the body ; what do@@ th it profit ?
and the scrip@@ ture was fulfilled which sa@@ ith , Abraham believed God , and it was im@@ puted unto him for righteousness : and he was called the Friend of God .
for in many things we offend all . if any man offend not in word , the same is a perfect man , and able also to bri@@ dle the whole body .
behold also the ships , which though they be so great , and are driven of fierce winds , yet are they turned about with a very small helm , whi@@ ther@@ soever the governor list@@ eth .
and the tongue is a fire , a world of ini@@ qu@@ ity : so is the tongue among our members , that it de@@ fil@@ eth the whole body , and sett@@ eth on fire the course of nature ; and it is set on fire of hell .
there@@ with bless we God , even the Father ; and there@@ with curse we men , which are made after the simil@@ itude of God .
who is a wise man and endu@@ ed with knowledge among you ? let him sh@@ ew out of a good conversation his works with me@@ ek@@ ness of wisdom .
but the wisdom that is from above is first pure , then peace@@ able , gentle , and easy to be int@@ re@@ ated , full of mercy and good fruits , without partiality , and without hypocrisy .
speak not evil one of another , brethren . he that spe@@ ak@@ eth evil of his brother , and jud@@ get@@ h his brother , spe@@ ak@@ eth evil of the law , and jud@@ get@@ h the law : but if thou judge the law , thou art not a do@@ er of the law , but a judge .
whereas ye know not what shall be on the mor@@ row . for what is your life ? it is even a vap@@ our , that appe@@ areth for a little time , and then van@@ ish@@ eth away .
your gold and silver is can@@ k@@ ered ; and the r@@ ust of them shall be a witness against you , and shall eat your flesh as it were fire . ye have he@@ aped treasure together for the last days .
be patient therefore , brethren , unto the coming of the Lord . behold , the hus@@ band@@ man wa@@ it@@ eth for the precious fruit of the earth , and hath long patience for it , until he receive the early and latter rain .
behold , we count them happy which endure . ye have heard of the patience of Job , and have seen the end of the Lord ; that the Lord is very p@@ iti@@ ful , and of tender mercy .
is any sick among you ? let him call for the elders of the church ; and let them pray over him , ano@@ in@@ ting him with oil in the name of the Lord :
confess your faults one to another , and pray one for another , that ye may be healed . the effec@@ tual ferv@@ ent prayer of a righteous man avail@@ eth much .
Eli@@ as was a man subject to like passions as we are , and he prayed ear@@ ne@@ stly that it might not rain : and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months .
elect according to the fore@@ knowledge of God the Father , through sanc@@ tification of the Spirit , unto obedience and sprink@@ ling of the blood of Jesus Christ : grace unto you , and peace , be multiplied .
blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , which according to his abundant mercy hath be@@ gotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time .
whom having not seen , ye love ; in whom , though now ye see him not , yet believing , ye rejoice with joy un@@ spe@@ ak@@ able and full of glory :
searching what , or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signi@@ fy , when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ , and the glory that should follow .
W@@ herefore gir@@ d up the lo@@ ins of your mind , be sober , and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ ;
and if ye call on the Father , who without respect of persons jud@@ get@@ h according to every man 's work , pass the time of your so@@ jour@@ ning here in fear :
who verily was fore@@ ordained before the foundation of the world , but was manifest in these last times for you ,
who by him do believe in God , that raised him up from the dead , and gave him glory ; that your faith and hope might be in God .
being born again , not of corrup@@ tible seed , but of in@@ corrup@@ tible , by the word of God , which liv@@ eth and ab@@ id@@ eth for ever .
but the word of the Lord endu@@ re@@ th for ever . and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you .
to whom coming , as unto a living stone , dis@@ allowed indeed of men , but chosen of God , and precious ,
W@@ herefore also it is contained in the scrip@@ ture , Be@@ hold , I lay in Si@@ on a chief corner stone , elect , precious : and he that believ@@ eth on him shall not be conf@@ ounded .
but ye are a chosen generation , a royal priesthood , an holy nation , a peculiar people ; that ye should sh@@ ew forth the pra@@ ises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marv@@ ell@@ ous light :
having your conversation honest among the Genti@@ les : that , whereas they speak against you as ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers , they may by your good works , which they shall behold , glori@@ fy God in the day of vis@@ itation .
submit yourselves to every ordin@@ ance of man for the Lord 's sake : whether it be to the king , as supreme ;
servants , be subject to your masters with all fear ; not only to the good and gentle , but also to the fro@@ ward .
who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree , that we , being dead to sins , should live unto righteousness : by whose stri@@ pes ye were healed .
likewise , ye wives , be in subj@@ ection to your own husbands ; that , if any obey not the word , they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives ;
even as Sar@@ a obeyed Abraham , calling him lord : whose daughters ye are , as long as ye do well , and are not afraid with any amaz@@ ement .
likewise , ye husbands , dwell with them according to knowledge , giving honour unto the wife , as unto the weaker vessel , and as being heirs together of the grace of life ; that your prayers be not hindered .
for he that will love life , and see good days , let him refrain his tongue from evil , and his lips that they speak no gu@@ ile :
but and if ye suffer for righteousness ' sake , happy are ye : and be not afraid of their terror , neither be troubled ;
but sancti@@ fy the Lord God in your hearts : and be ready always to give an answer to every man that as@@ ket@@ h you a reason of the hope that is in you with me@@ ek@@ ness and fear :
having a good conscience ; that , whereas they speak evil of you , as of ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers , they may be ashamed that fal@@ sely accuse your good conversation in Christ .
for Christ also hath once suffered for sins , the just for the unjust , that he might bring us to God , being put to death in the flesh , but quick@@ ened by the Spirit :
which sometime were dis@@ obedient , when once the long@@ suffering of God waited in the days of Noah , while the ark was a preparing , where@@ in few , that is , eight souls were saved by water .
who is gone into heaven , and is on the right hand of God ; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him .
for@@ as@@ much then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh , arm yourselves likewise with the same mind : for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin ;
as every man hath received the gift , even so minister the same one to another , as good ste@@ wards of the manif@@ old grace of God .
beloved , think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you , as though some strange thing happened unto you :
if ye be repro@@ ached for the name of Christ , happy are ye ; for the spirit of glory and of God rest@@ eth upon you : on their part he is evil spoken of , but on your part he is glori@@ fied .
but let none of you suffer as a murderer , or as a thief , or as an ev@@ il@@ do@@ er , or as a bus@@ y@@ body in other men 's matters .
yet if any man suffer as a Christian , let him not be ashamed ; but let him glori@@ fy God on this behalf .
feed the flock of God which is among you , taking the oversight thereof , not by constraint , but willingly ; not for fil@@ thy luc@@ re , but of a ready mind ;
the church that is at Babylon , elected together with you , sal@@ ut@@ eth you ; and so do@@ th Mar@@ cus my son .
Simon Peter , a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ , to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ :
according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that per@@ tain unto life and god@@ liness , through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue :
whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises : that by these ye might be part@@ akers of the divine nature , having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust .
for if these things be in you , and abound , they make you that ye shall neither be bar@@ ren nor un@@ fruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
but he that l@@ ack@@ eth these things is blind , and C@@ AN@@ NOT see af@@ ar off , and hath forgotten that he was pur@@ ged from his old sins .
W@@ herefore the rather , brethren , give diligence to make your calling and election sure : for if ye do these things , ye shall never fall :
for so an entrance shall be minist@@ ered unto you ab@@ und@@ antly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ .
W@@ herefore I will not be neg@@ lig@@ ent to put you always in rem@@ embrance of these things , though ye know them , and be established in the present truth .
for we have not followed c@@ un@@ n@@ ingly devised f@@ ables , when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but were eye@@ witnesses of his maj@@ esty .
for he received from God the Father honour and glory , when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased .
for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man : but holy men of God sp@@ ake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost .
but there were false prophets also among the people , even as there shall be false teachers among you , who priv@@ ily shall bring in dam@@ n@@ able here@@ sies , even denying the Lord that bought them , and bring upon themselves swift destruction .
and many shall follow their pernicious ways ; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of .
for if God spared not the angels that sin@@ ned , but cast them down to hell , and delivered them into chains of darkness , to be reserved unto judgment ;
and turning the cities of So@@ dom and Gom@@ orr@@ ha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow , making them an ens@@ ample unto those that after should live un@@ go@@ dly ;
but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of un@@ clean@@ ness , and desp@@ ise government . presu@@ mp@@ tuous are they , self@@ w@@ illed , they are not afraid to speak evil of dig@@ n@@ ities .
but these , as natural br@@ ute beasts , made to be taken and destroyed , speak evil of the things that they understand not ; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption ;
and shall receive the reward of un@@ righteousness , as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time . spots they are and bl@@ em@@ ishes , sporting themselves with their own decei@@ vings while they feast with you ;
having eyes full of adul@@ tery , and that C@@ AN@@ NOT cease from sin ; be@@ gu@@ iling unstable souls : an heart they have exercised with co@@ vet@@ ous practices ; cur@@ sed children :
which have for@@ s@@ aken the right way , and are gone astr@@ ay , following the way of Bal@@ a@@ am the son of Bos@@ or , who loved the wages of un@@ righteousness ;
for if after they have escaped the pollu@@ tions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , they are again ent@@ angled therein , and overcome , the latter end is worse with them than the beginning .
the Lord is not slack concerning his promise , as some men count sl@@ ack@@ ness ; but is long@@ suffering to us @@@ -@@ @ ward , not willing that any should perish , but that all should come to repentance .
seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved , what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and god@@ liness ,
and account that the long@@ suffering of our Lord is salvation ; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you ;
ye therefore , beloved , seeing ye know these things before , beware lest ye also , being led away with the error of the wicked , fall from your own st@@ ed@@ fast@@ ness .
but grow in grace , and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ . to him be glory both now and for ever . A@@ men .
that which was from the beginning , which we have heard , which we have seen with our eyes , which we have looked upon , and our hands have handled , of the Word of life ;
( for the life was manifested , and we have seen it , and bear witness , and sh@@ ew unto you that eternal life , which was with the Father , and was manifested unto us ; )
this then is the message which we have heard of him , and declare unto you , that God is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
brethren , I write no new commandment unto you , but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning . the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning .
I have written unto you , fathers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . I have written unto you , young men , because ye are strong , and the word of God ab@@ id@@ eth in you , and ye have overcome the wicked one .
love not the world , neither the things that are in the world . if any man love the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
for all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , and the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the Father , but is of the world .
wh@@ oso@@ ever deni@@ eth the Son , the same hath not the Father : ( but ) he that acknowled@@ get@@ h the Son hath the Father also .
and now , little children , abide in him ; that , when he shall appear , we may have confidence , and not be ashamed before him at his coming .
behold , what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us , that we should be called the sons of God : therefore the world know@@ eth us not , because it knew him not .
beloved , now are we the sons of God , and it do@@ th not yet appear what we shall be : but we know that , when he shall appear , we shall be like him ; for we shall see him as he is .
he that commit@@ t@@ eth sin is of the devil ; for the devil sin@@ neth from the beginning . for this purpose the Son of God was manifested , that he might destroy the works of the devil .
in this the children of God are manifest , and the children of the devil : wh@@ oso@@ ever do@@ eth not righteousness is not of God , neither he that lov@@ eth not his brother .
hereby perceive we the love of God , because he laid down his life for us : and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren .
my little children , let us not love in word , neither in tongue ; but in deed and in truth .
and whatsoever we ask , we receive of him , because we keep his commandments , and do those things that are pleasing in his sight .
and this is his commandment , That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ , and love one another , as he gave us commandment .
and every spirit that conf@@ ess@@ eth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God : and this is that spirit of anti@@ ch@@ rist , where@@ of ye have heard that it should come ; and even now already is it in the world .
ye are of God , little children , and have overcome them : because greater is he that is in you , than he that is in the world .
we are of God : he that know@@ eth God he@@ areth us ; he that is not of God he@@ areth not us . hereby know we the spirit of truth , and the spirit of error .
in this was manifested the love of God toward us , because that God sent his only be@@ gotten Son into the world , that we might live through him .
there is no fear in love ; but perfect love cast@@ eth out fear : because fear hath tor@@ ment . he that fe@@ areth is not made perfect in love .
if a man say , I love God , and hat@@ eth his brother , he is a li@@ ar : for he that lov@@ eth not his brother whom he hath seen , how can he love God whom he hath not seen ?
this is he that came by water and blood , even Jesus Christ ; not by water only , but by water and blood . and it is the Spirit that be@@ areth witness , because the Spirit is truth .
for there are three that bear record in heaven , the Father , the Word , and the Holy Ghost : and these three are one .
if we receive the witness of men , the witness of God is greater : for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son .
he that believ@@ eth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself : he that believ@@ eth not God hath made him a li@@ ar ; because he believ@@ eth not the record that God gave of his Son .
the elder unto the elect lady and her children , whom I love in the truth ; and not I only , but also all they that have known the truth ;
grace be with you , mercy , and peace , from God the Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
for many decei@@ vers are entered into the world , who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh . this is a decei@@ ver and an anti@@ ch@@ rist .
wh@@ oso@@ ever trans@@ gres@@ set@@ h , and ab@@ id@@ eth not in the doctrine of Christ , hath not God . he that ab@@ id@@ eth in the doctrine of Christ , he hath both the Father and the Son .
having many things to write unto you , I would not write with paper and ink : but I trust to come unto you , and speak face to face , that our joy may be full .
for I rejo@@ iced greatly , when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee , even as thou walk@@ est in the truth .
which have borne witness of thy charity before the church : whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a go@@ dly sort , thou shalt do well :
W@@ herefore , if I come , I will remember his deeds which he do@@ eth , pr@@ ating against us with malicious words : and not content there@@ with , neither do@@ th he himself receive the brethren , and forbid@@ det@@ h them that would , and cast@@ eth them out of the church .
beloved , follow not that which is evil , but that which is good . he that do@@ eth good is of God : but he that do@@ eth evil hath not seen God .
Dem@@ et@@ ri@@ us hath good report of all men , and of the truth itself : ye@@ a , and we also bear record ; and ye know that our record is true .
for there are certain men cre@@ pt in un@@ awa@@ res , who were before of old ordained to this condemnation , un@@ go@@ dly men , turning the grace of our God into l@@ as@@ ci@@ vi@@ ousness , and denying the only Lord God , and our Lord Jesus Christ .
and the angels which kept not their first estate , but left their own hab@@ itation , he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day .
yet Michael the ar@@ chang@@ el , when cont@@ ending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses , Dur@@ st not bring against him a rail@@ ing accusation , but said , The Lord rebu@@ ke thee .
w@@ oe unto them ! for they have gone in the way of C@@ ain , and ran gre@@ ed@@ ily after the error of Bal@@ a@@ am for reward , and perished in the g@@ ain@@ saying of Core .
raging waves of the sea , fo@@ aming out their own shame ; wandering stars , to whom is reserved the black@@ ness of darkness for ever .
to execute judgment upon all , and to convince all that are un@@ go@@ dly among them of all their un@@ go@@ dly deeds which they have un@@ go@@ dly committed , and of all their hard speeches which un@@ go@@ dly sinners have spoken against him .
how that they told you there should be mo@@ c@@ kers in the last time , who should walk after their own un@@ go@@ dly lu@@ sts .
to the only wise God our Saviour , be glory and maj@@ esty , dom@@ inion and power , both now and ever . A@@ men .
the Revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave unto him , to sh@@ ew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass ; and he sent and signi@@ fied it by his angel unto his servant John :
John to the seven churches which are in Asia : grace be unto you , and peace , from him which is , and which was , and which is to come ; and from the seven Spir@@ its which are before his throne ;
and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father ; to him be glory and dom@@ inion for ever and ever . A@@ men .
behold , he com@@ eth with clouds ; and every eye shall see him , and they also which pi@@ er@@ ced him : and all kind@@ re@@ ds of the earth shall w@@ ail because of him . even so , A@@ men .
I John , who also am your brother , and companion in tribu@@ lation , and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ , was in the is@@ le that is called Pat@@ mos , for the word of God , and for the testimony of Jesus Christ .
I was in the Spirit on the Lord 's day , and heard behind me a great voice , as of a trum@@ pet ,
and his feet like unto fine brass , as if they burned in a furnace ; and his voice as the sound of many waters .
I am he that liv@@ eth , and was dead ; and , behold , I am alive for ever@@ more , A@@ men ; and have the keys of hell and of death .
the mystery of the seven stars which thou saw@@ est in my right hand , and the seven golden cand@@ les@@ tic@@ ks . the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches : and the seven cand@@ les@@ tic@@ ks which thou saw@@ est are the seven churches .
and hast borne , and hast patience , and for my name 's sake hast lab@@ oured , and hast not fain@@ ted .
and unto the angel of the church in S@@ my@@ r@@ na write ; These things sa@@ ith the first and the last , which was dead , and is alive ;
he that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit sa@@ ith unto the churches ; He that over@@ com@@ eth shall not be hurt of the second death .
but I have a few things against thee , because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Bal@@ a@@ am , who taught Bal@@ ac to cast a stum@@ bl@@ ing@@ block before the children of Israel , to eat things sacrificed unto idols , and to commit for@@ n@@ ication .
notwithstanding I have a few things against thee , because thou suffer@@ est that woman J@@ ez@@ e@@ bel , which call@@ eth herself a proph@@ et@@ ess , to teach and to se@@ duce my servants to commit for@@ n@@ ication , and to eat things sacrificed unto idols .
behold , I will cast her into a bed , and them that commit adul@@ tery with her into great tribu@@ lation , except they repent of their deeds .
and I will kill her children with death ; and all the churches shall know that I am he which search@@ eth the re@@ ins and hearts : and I will give unto every one of you according to your works .
but unto you I say , and unto the rest in T@@ hy@@ ati@@ ra , as many as have not this doctrine , and which have not known the depths of Satan , as they speak ; I will put upon you none other burden .
and he shall rule them with a rod of iron ; as the vessels of a pot@@ ter shall they be broken to shi@@ vers : even as I received of my Father .
and unto the angel of the church in Sar@@ dis write ; These things sa@@ ith he that hath the seven Spir@@ its of God , and the seven stars ; I know thy works , that thou hast a name that thou liv@@ est , and art dead .
I know thy works : behold , I have set before thee an open door , and no man can shut it : for thou hast a little strength , and hast kept my word , and hast not denied my name .
because thou hast kept the word of my patience , I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation , which shall come upon all the world , to try them that dwell upon the earth .
I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire , that thou may@@ est be rich ; and white ra@@ iment , that thou may@@ est be clo@@ thed , and that the shame of thy n@@ ak@@ edness do not appear ; and ano@@ int th@@ ine eyes with ey@@ es@@ al@@ ve , that thou may@@ est see .
behold , I stand at the door , and knock : if any man hear my voice , and open the door , I will come in to him , and will su@@ p with him , and he with me .
to him that over@@ com@@ eth will I grant to sit with me in my throne , even as I also over@@ came , and am set down with my Father in his throne .
after this I looked , and , behold , a door was opened in heaven : and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trum@@ pet talking with me ; which said , Come up hi@@ ther , and I will sh@@ ew thee things which must be here@@ after .
and round about the throne were four and twenty seats : and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting , clo@@ thed in white ra@@ iment ; and they had on their heads crow@@ ns of gold .
and out of the throne proceeded light@@ nings and thunder@@ ings and voices : and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne , which are the seven Spir@@ its of God .
and the first beast was like a lion , and the second beast like a cal@@ f , and the third beast had a face as a man , and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle .
and when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne , who liv@@ eth for ever and ever ,
the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne , and worship him that liv@@ eth for ever and ever , and cast their crow@@ ns before the throne , saying ,
thou art worthy , O Lord , to receive glory and honour and power : for thou hast created all things , and for thy pleasure they are and were created .
and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back@@ side , sealed with seven seals .
and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice , Who is worthy to open the book , and to loose the seals thereof ?
and one of the elders sa@@ ith unto me , We@@ ep not : behold , the Lion of the tribe of Jud@@ a , the Root of David , hath prevailed to open the book , and to loose the seven seals thereof .
and when he had taken the book , the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lam@@ b , having every one of them har@@ ps , and golden vi@@ als full of od@@ ours , which are the prayers of saints .
and they sung a new song , saying , Th@@ ou art worthy to take the book , and to open the seals thereof : for thou w@@ ast sl@@ ain , and hast re@@ deemed us to God by thy blood out of every kind@@ red , and tongue , and people , and nation ;
saying with a loud voice , Wor@@ thy is the Lam@@ b that was sl@@ ain to receive power , and riches , and wisdom , and strength , and honour , and glory , and blessing .
and the four beasts said , A@@ men . and the four and twenty elders fell down and wor@@ shipped him that liv@@ eth for ever and ever .
and I saw when the Lam@@ b opened one of the seals , and I heard , as it were the noise of thunder , one of the four beasts saying , Come and see .
and when he had opened the third seal , I heard the third beast say , Come and see . and I be@@ held , and lo a black horse ; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand .
and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say , A measure of wheat for a penny , and three measures of barley for a penny ; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine .
and when he had opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of them that were sl@@ ain for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held :
and they cried with a loud voice , saying , How long , O Lord , holy and true , d@@ ost thou not judge and av@@ enge our blood on them that dwell on the earth ?
and white robes were given unto every one of them ; and it was said unto them , that they should rest yet for a little season , until their fel@@ low@@ servants also and their brethren , that should be killed as they were , should be fulfilled .
and I be@@ held when he had opened the sixth seal , and , lo , there was a great earthquake ; and the sun became black as s@@ ack@@ cloth of hair , and the moon became as blood ;
and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together ; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places .
for the great day of his wrath is come ; and who shall be able to stand ?
and after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , that the wind should not blow on the earth , nor on the sea , nor on any tree .
and I saw another angel asc@@ ending from the east , having the seal of the living God : and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels , to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea ,
of the tribe of Jud@@ a were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Re@@ ub@@ en were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of G@@ ad were sealed twelve thousand .
of the tribe of As@@ er were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Nep@@ th@@ ali@@ m were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Man@@ asses were sealed twelve thousand .
of the tribe of Sim@@ eon were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Lev@@ i were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Is@@ sac@@ har were sealed twelve thousand .
of the tribe of Z@@ abul@@ on were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand . of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand .
and cried with a loud voice , saying , Sal@@ vation to our God which sit@@ t@@ eth upon the throne , and unto the Lam@@ b .
and all the angels stood round about the throne , and about the elders and the four beasts , and fell before the throne on their faces , and wor@@ shipped God ,
saying , A@@ men : blessing , and glory , and wisdom , and thank@@ s@@ giving , and honour , and power , and might , be unto our God for ever and ever . A@@ men .
and I said unto him , Sir , thou know@@ est . and he said to me , These are they which came out of great tribu@@ lation , and have washed their robes , and made them white in the blood of the Lam@@ b .
for the Lam@@ b which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them , and shall lead them unto living foun@@ tains of waters : and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes .
and when he had opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour .
and another angel came and stood at the altar , having a golden cen@@ ser ; and there was given unto him much inc@@ ense , that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne .
and the angel took the cen@@ ser , and filled it with fire of the altar , and cast it into the earth : and there were voices , and thunder@@ ings , and light@@ nings , and an earthquake .
the first angel sounded , and there followed hail and fire ming@@ led with blood , and they were cast upon the earth : and the third part of trees was burnt up , and all green grass was burnt up .
and the second angel sounded , and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea : and the third part of the sea became blood ;
and the fourth angel sounded , and the third part of the sun was sm@@ it@@ ten , and the third part of the moon , and the third part of the stars ; so as the third part of them was dark@@ ened , and the day shone not for a third part of it , and the night likewise .
and there came out of the smoke lo@@ cu@@ sts upon the earth : and unto them was given power , as the scor@@ pi@@ ons of the earth have power .
and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree ; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their fore@@ heads .
and to them it was given that they should not kill them , but that they should be tor@@ m@@ ented five months : and their tor@@ ment was as the tor@@ ment of a scor@@ pi@@ on , when he stri@@ ket@@ h a man .
and in those days shall men seek death , and shall not find it ; and shall desire to die , and death shall flee from them .
saying to the sixth angel which had the trum@@ pet , Lo@@ ose the four angels which are bound in the great river E@@ uph@@ rates .
and the four angels were loos@@ ed , which were prepared for an hour , and a day , and a month , and a year , for to sl@@ ay the third part of men .
by these three was the third part of men killed , by the fire , and by the smoke , and by the bri@@ m@@ stone , which issued out of their mouths .
and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven , clo@@ thed with a cloud : and a rain@@ bow was upon his head , and his face was as it were the sun , and his feet as pillars of fire :
and he had in his hand a little book open : and he set his right foot upon the sea , and his left foot on the earth ,
and when the seven th@@ un@@ ders had uttered their voices , I was about to write : and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me , Se@@ al up those things which the seven th@@ un@@ ders uttered , and write them not .
and sw@@ are by him that liv@@ eth for ever and ever , who created heaven , and the things that therein are , and the earth , and the things that therein are , and the sea , and the things which are therein , that there should be time no longer :
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he shall begin to sound , the mystery of God should be finished , as he hath declared to his servants the prophets .
and the voice which I heard from heaven sp@@ ake unto me again , and said , Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which stand@@ eth upon the sea and upon the earth .
and I went unto the angel , and said unto him , Gi@@ ve me the little book . and he said unto me , Take it , and eat it up ; and it shall make thy belly bitter , but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey .
and I took the little book out of the angel 's hand , and ate it up ; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey : and as soon as I had eaten it , my belly was bitter .
and I will give power unto my two witnesses , and they shall proph@@ esy a thousand two hundred and thre@@ es@@ core days , clo@@ thed in s@@ ack@@ cloth .
these are the two olive trees , and the two cand@@ les@@ tic@@ ks standing before the God of the earth .
and if any man will hurt them , fire proce@@ ed@@ eth out of their mouth , and dev@@ ou@@ re@@ th their enemies : and if any man will hurt them , he must in this manner be killed .
and when they shall have finished their testimony , the beast that as@@ cen@@ det@@ h out of the bot@@ tom@@ less pit shall make war against them , and shall overcome them , and kill them .
and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city , which spiritually is called So@@ dom and Egypt , where also our Lord was cruci@@ fied .
and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them , and make mer@@ ry , and shall send gifts one to another ; because these two prophets tor@@ m@@ ented them that d@@ wel@@ t on the earth .
and the same hour was there a great earthquake , and the tenth part of the city fell , and in the earthquake were sl@@ ain of men seven thousand : and the remn@@ ant were aff@@ righ@@ ted , and gave glory to the God of heaven .
and the seventh angel sounded ; and there were great voices in heaven , saying , The king@@ doms of this world are become the king@@ doms of our Lord , and of his Christ ; and he shall reign for ever and ever .
saying , We give thee thanks , O Lord God Almighty , which art , and w@@ ast , and art to come ; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power , and hast re@@ igned .
and the temple of God was opened in heaven , and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament : and there were light@@ nings , and voices , and thunder@@ ings , and an earthquake , and great hail .
and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven , and did cast them to the earth : and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered , for to dev@@ our her child as soon as it was born .
and she brought forth a man child , who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron : and her child was caught up unto God , and to his throne .
and the woman fled into the wilderness , where she hath a place prepared of God , that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and thre@@ es@@ core days .
and the great dragon was cast out , that old ser@@ pent , called the Devil , and Satan , which decei@@ v@@ eth the whole world : he was cast out into the earth , and his angels were cast out with him .
and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven , Now is come salvation , and strength , and the kingdom of our God , and the power of his Christ : for the acc@@ user of our brethren is cast down , which accused them before our God day and night .
therefore rejoice , ye heavens , and ye that dwell in them . w@@ oe to the inhabit@@ ers of the earth and of the sea ! for the devil is come down unto you , having great wrath , because he know@@ eth that he hath but a short time .
and the earth helped the woman , and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth .
and the dragon was w@@ ro@@ th with the woman , and went to make war with the remn@@ ant of her seed , which keep the commandments of God , and have the testimony of Jesus Christ .
and I stood upon the sand of the sea , and saw a beast rise up out of the sea , having seven heads and ten horns , and upon his horns ten crow@@ ns , and upon his heads the name of bl@@ asph@@ emy .
and the beast which I saw was like unto a le@@ op@@ ard , and his feet were as the feet of a bear , and his mouth as the mouth of a lion : and the dragon gave him his power , and his seat , and great authority .
and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ies ; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months .
and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him , whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lam@@ b sl@@ ain from the foundation of the world .
he that lead@@ eth into cap@@ tivity shall go into cap@@ tivity : he that kill@@ eth with the sword must be killed with the sword . here is the patience and the faith of the saints .
and he exerc@@ is@@ eth all the power of the first beast before him , and caus@@ eth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast , whose deadly wound was healed .
and he do@@ eth great wonders , so that he mak@@ eth fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men ,
and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed .
and I looked , and , lo , a Lam@@ b stood on the mount Si@@ on , and with him an hundred forty and four thousand , having his Father 's name written in their fore@@ heads .
and I heard a voice from heaven , as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of a great thunder : and I heard the voice of Har@@ pers har@@ ping with their har@@ ps :
and they sung as it were a new song before the throne , and before the four beasts , and the elders : and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand , which were re@@ deemed from the earth .
and I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven , having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth , and to every nation , and kind@@ red , and tongue , and people ,
saying with a loud voice , Fe@@ ar God , and give glory to him ; for the hour of his judgment is come : and worship him that made heaven , and earth , and the sea , and the foun@@ tains of waters .
and there followed another angel , saying , Babylon is fallen , is fallen , that great city , because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her for@@ n@@ ication .
and the third angel followed them , saying with a loud voice , If any man worship the beast and his image , and receive his mark in his forehead , or in his hand ,
and the smoke of their tor@@ ment as@@ cen@@ det@@ h up for ever and ever : and they have no rest day nor night , who worship the beast and his image , and wh@@ oso@@ ever recei@@ v@@ eth the mark of his name .
and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me , Write , Bless@@ ed are the dead which die in the Lord from h@@ ence@@ forth : ye@@ a , sa@@ ith the Spirit , that they may rest from their lab@@ ours ; and their works do follow them .
and I looked , and behold a white cloud , and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man , having on his head a golden crown , and in his hand a sharp sick@@ le .
and another angel came out of the temple , crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud , Thr@@ ust in thy sick@@ le , and reap : for the time is come for thee to reap ; for the harvest of the earth is ripe .
and he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sick@@ le on the earth ; and the earth was re@@ aped .
and the angel thrust in his sick@@ le into the earth , and gathered the vine of the earth , and cast it into the great win@@ ep@@ ress of the wrath of God .
and I saw another sign in heaven , great and marv@@ ell@@ ous , seven angels having the seven last pl@@ agues ; for in them is filled up the wrath of God .
and they sing the song of Moses the servant of God , and the song of the Lam@@ b , saying , Great and marv@@ ell@@ ous are thy works , Lord God Almighty ; just and true are thy ways , thou King of saints .
and after that I looked , and , behold , the temple of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the testimony in heaven was opened :
and the seven angels came out of the temple , having the seven pl@@ agues , clo@@ thed in pure and white linen , and having their breasts gir@@ ded with golden gir@@ dles .
and one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vi@@ als full of the wrath of God , who liv@@ eth for ever and ever .
and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God , and from his power ; and no man was able to enter into the temple , till the seven pl@@ agues of the seven angels were fulfilled .
and the first went , and poured out his vial upon the earth ; and there fell a nois@@ ome and griev@@ ous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast , and upon them which wor@@ shipped his image .
and the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea ; and it became as the blood of a dead man : and every living soul died in the sea .
and the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and foun@@ tains of waters ; and they became blood .
and I heard the angel of the waters say , Th@@ ou art righteous , O Lord , which art , and w@@ ast , and shalt be , because thou hast judged thus .
and the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun ; and power was given unto him to scor@@ ch men with fire .
and the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast ; and his kingdom was full of darkness ; and they gn@@ aw@@ ed their tongues for pain ,
and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river E@@ uph@@ rates ; and the water thereof was dried up , that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared .
for they are the spirits of dev@@ ils , working miracles , which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world , to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty .
and there were voices , and th@@ un@@ ders , and light@@ nings ; and there was a great earthquake , such as was not since men were upon the earth , so mighty an earthquake , and so great .
and the great city was divided into three parts , and the cities of the nations fell : and great Babylon came in rem@@ embrance before God , to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierc@@ eness of his wrath .
and there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven , every stone about the weight of a talent : and men bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ed God because of the plague of the hail ; for the plague thereof was exceeding great .
and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vi@@ als , and talked with me , saying unto me , Come hi@@ ther ; I will sh@@ ew unto thee the judgment of the great wh@@ ore that sit@@ t@@ eth upon many waters :
so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness : and I saw a woman sit upon a scar@@ let coloured beast , full of names of bl@@ asph@@ emy , having seven heads and ten horns .
and the woman was ar@@ ra@@ yed in purple and scar@@ let colour , and dec@@ ked with gold and precious stones and pear@@ ls , having a golden cup in her hand full of ab@@ om@@ inations and fil@@ thiness of her for@@ n@@ ication :
and upon her forehead was a name written , MY@@ ST@@ ER@@ Y , B@@ AB@@ Y@@ LO@@ N THE G@@ RE@@ AT , THE MO@@ TH@@ ER OF har@@ lots AND A@@ BO@@ MIN@@ ATIONS OF THE E@@ AR@@ TH .
and the angel said unto me , W@@ herefore did@@ st thou mar@@ vel ? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman , and of the beast that carri@@ eth her , which hath the seven heads and ten horns .
and there are seven kings : five are fallen , and one is , and the other is not yet come ; and when he com@@ eth , he must continue a short space .
these shall make war with the Lam@@ b , and the Lam@@ b shall overcome them : for he is Lord of lords , and King of kings : and they that are with him are called , and chosen , and faithful .
and the ten horns which thou saw@@ est upon the beast , these shall hate the wh@@ ore , and shall make her des@@ ol@@ ate and naked , and shall eat her flesh , and burn her with fire .
and I heard another voice from heaven , saying , Come out of her , my people , that ye be not part@@ akers of her sins , and that ye receive not of her pl@@ agues .
how much she hath glori@@ fied herself , and lived del@@ ici@@ ously , so much tor@@ ment and sorrow give her : for she sa@@ ith in her heart , I sit a queen , and am no widow , and shall see no sorrow .
therefore shall her pl@@ agues come in one day , death , and mourning , and famine ; and she shall be utterly burned with fire : for strong is the Lord God who jud@@ get@@ h her .
and the fruits that thy soul lu@@ sted after are departed from thee , and all things which were d@@ ain@@ ty and goo@@ dly are departed from thee , and thou shalt find them no more at all .
and saying , Al@@ as , alas , that great city , that was clo@@ thed in fine linen , and purple , and scar@@ let , and dec@@ ked with gold , and precious stones , and pear@@ ls !
for in one hour so great riches is come to n@@ ought . and every ship@@ master , and all the company in ships , and sailors , and as many as trade by sea , stood af@@ ar off ,
and they cast dust on their heads , and cried , we@@ eping and w@@ ailing , saying , Al@@ as , alas , that great city , where@@ in were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her co@@ st@@ liness ! for in one hour is she made des@@ ol@@ ate .
and a mighty angel took up a stone like a great mil@@ l@@ stone , and cast it into the sea , saying , Th@@ us with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down , and shall be found no more at all .
and after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven , saying , All@@ elu@@ ia ; Sal@@ vation , and glory , and honour , and power , unto the Lord our God :
for true and righteous are his judgments : for he hath judged the great wh@@ ore , which did corrupt the earth with her for@@ n@@ ication , and hath av@@ eng@@ ed the blood of his servants at her hand .
and the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and wor@@ shipped God that sat on the throne , saying , A@@ men ; All@@ elu@@ ia .
and a voice came out of the throne , saying , P@@ raise our God , all ye his servants , and ye that fear him , both small and great .
and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude , and as the voice of many waters , and as the voice of mighty thunder@@ ings , saying , All@@ elu@@ ia : for the Lord God omni@@ potent re@@ ig@@ neth .
and I saw heaven opened , and behold a white horse ; and he that sat upon him was called F@@ ai@@ thful and True , and in righteousness he do@@ th judge and make war .
and he hath on his vest@@ ure and on his thi@@ gh a name written , K@@ ING OF K@@ IN@@ GS , AND LORD OF L@@ ords .
and I saw an angel standing in the sun ; and he cried with a loud voice , saying to all the f@@ ow@@ ls that fly in the midst of heaven , Come and gather yourselves together unto the sup@@ per of the great God ;
and I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse , and against his army .
and he laid hold on the dragon , that old ser@@ pent , which is the Devil , and Satan , and bound him a thousand years ,
and cast him into the bot@@ tom@@ less pit , and shut him up , and set a seal upon him , that he should deceive the nations no more , till the thousand years should be fulfilled : and after that he must be loos@@ ed a little season .
blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection : on such the second death hath no power , but they shall be priests of God and of Christ , and shall reign with him a thousand years .
and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and bri@@ m@@ stone , where the beast and the false prophet are , and shall be tor@@ m@@ ented day and night for ever and ever .
and I saw a great white throne , and him that sat on it , from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away ; and there was found no place for them .
and the sea gave up the dead which were in it ; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them : and they were judged every man according to their works .
and I saw a new heaven and a new earth : for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away ; and there was no more sea .
and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying , Be@@ hold , the tab@@ ern@@ acle of God is with men , and he will dwell with them , and they shall be his people , and God himself shall be with them , and be their God .
and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes ; and there shall be no more death , neither sorrow , nor crying , neither shall there be any more pain : for the former things are passed away .
and he that sat upon the throne said , Be@@ hold , I make all things new . and he said unto me , Write : for these words are true and faithful .
he that over@@ com@@ eth shall inherit all things ; and I will be his God , and he shall be my son .
but the fearful , and un@@ believing , and the ab@@ om@@ in@@ able , and murderers , and wh@@ ore@@ mon@@ gers , and sorcer@@ ers , and id@@ ol@@ aters , and all li@@ ars , shall have their part in the lake which bur@@ neth with fire and bri@@ m@@ stone : which is the second death .
and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vi@@ als full of the seven last pl@@ agues , and talked with me , saying , Come hi@@ ther , I will sh@@ ew thee the bride , the Lam@@ b 's wife .
and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain , and sh@@ ew@@ ed me that great city , the holy Jerusalem , descending out of heaven from God ,
and the city li@@ eth four@@ square , and the length is as large as the breadth : and he measured the city with the re@@ ed , twelve thousand fur@@ l@@ ongs . the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal .
and the twelve gates were twelve pear@@ ls ; every several gate was of one pear@@ l : and the street of the city was pure gold , as it were transparent glass .
and the city had no need of the sun , neither of the moon , to shine in it : for the glory of God did ligh@@ ten it , and the Lam@@ b is the light thereof .
and there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that de@@ fil@@ eth , neither whatsoever work@@ eth ab@@ om@@ ination , or mak@@ eth a lie : but they which are written in the Lam@@ b 's book of life .
and he sh@@ ew@@ ed me a pure river of water of life , clear as crystal , proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lam@@ b .
in the midst of the street of it , and on either side of the river , was there the tree of life , which bare twelve manner of fruits , and yielded her fruit every month : and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations .
and there shall be no more curse : but the throne of God and of the Lam@@ b shall be in it ; and his servants shall serve him :
and he said unto me , These say@@ ings are faithful and true : and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to sh@@ ew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done .
and I John saw these things , and heard them . and when I had heard and seen , I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which sh@@ ew@@ ed me these things .
then sa@@ ith he unto me , See thou do it not : for I am thy fel@@ low@@ servant , and of thy brethren the prophets , and of them which keep the say@@ ings of this book : worship God .
and , behold , I come quickly ; and my reward is with me , to give every man according as his work shall be .
blessed are they that do his commandments , that they may have right to the tree of life , and may enter in through the gates into the city .
I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches . I am the root and the offspring of David , and the bright and morning star .
for I testify unto every man that he@@ areth the words of the prophecy of this book , If any man shall add unto these things , God shall add unto him the pl@@ agues that are written in this book :
