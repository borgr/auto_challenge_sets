as the LORD commanded Moses , so Aaron laid it up before the T@@ estim@@ ony , to be kept .
and I said unto them , Wh@@ oso@@ ever hath any gold , let them break it off . so they gave it me : then I cast it into the fire , and there came out this cal@@ f .

and he shall bring them unto the priest , who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first , and wr@@ ing off his head from his neck , but shall not divide it as@@ under :
in a pan it shall be made with oil ; and when it is b@@ aken , thou shalt bring it in : and the b@@ aken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a sweet sav@@ our unto the LORD .

but if the priest look on it , and , behold , there be no white ha@@ irs therein , and if it be not lower than the skin , but be somewhat dark ; then the priest shall shut him up seven days :
then the priest shall command that they wash the thing where@@ in the plague is , and he shall shut it up seven days more :
and I will set my face against that man , and will cut him off from among his people ; because he hath given of his seed unto Mol@@ ech , to def@@ ile my sanctuary , and to prof@@ ane my holy name .
then I will set my face against that man , and against his family , and will cut him off , and all that go a wh@@ oring after him , to commit wh@@ ore@@ dom with Mol@@ ech , from among their people .
and the soul that tur@@ neth after such as have familiar spirits , and after w@@ izards , to go a wh@@ oring after them , I will even set my face against that soul , and will cut him off from among his people .
and when the tab@@ ern@@ acle sett@@ eth forward , the Lev@@ ites shall take it down : and when the tab@@ ern@@ acle is to be pit@@ ched , the Lev@@ ites shall set it up : and the stranger that com@@ eth ni@@ gh shall be put to death .
and the priest shall write these cur@@ ses in a book , and he shall b@@ lot them out with the bitter water :
and Moses sent them to spy out the land of Can@@ a@@ an , and said unto them , Get you up this way sou@@ th@@ ward , and go up into the mountain :
but if the LORD make a new thing , and the earth open her mouth , and swallow them up , with all that ap@@ per@@ tain unto them , and they go down quick into the pit ; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD .
and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up , and their houses , and all the men that ap@@ per@@ tained unto Kor@@ ah , and all their goods .
and all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them : for they said , L@@ est the earth swallow us up also .

take Aaron and Ele@@ az@@ ar his son , and bring them up unto mount H@@ or :

and because he loved thy fathers , therefore he chose their seed after them , and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt ;
and he brought us out from th@@ ence , that he might bring us in , to give us the land which he sw@@ are unto our fathers .
but because the LORD loved you , and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers , hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand , and re@@ deemed you out of the house of bond@@ men , from the hand of Phar@@ aoh king of Egypt .
understand therefore this day , that the LORD thy God is he which go@@ eth over before thee ; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them , and he shall bring them down before thy face : so shalt thou drive them out , and destroy them quickly , as the LORD hath said unto thee .
and a curse , if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God , but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day , to go after other gods , which ye have not known .
and it shall come to pass , when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whi@@ ther thou go@@ est to possess it , that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Ger@@ iz@@ im , and the curse upon mount E@@ bal .
at the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the ti@@ the of th@@ ine increase the same year , and shalt lay it up within thy gates :

and Joshua said unto them , Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan , and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder , according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel :
Joshua therefore commanded the priests , saying , Come ye up out of Jordan .

and David sent out ten young men , and David said unto the young men , Get you up to Car@@ me@@ l , and go to Nab@@ al , and greet him in my name :
and he smo@@ te Mo@@ ab , and measured them with a line , casting them down to the ground ; even with two lines measured he to put to death , and with one full line to keep alive . and so the Mo@@ ab@@ ites became David 's servants , and brought gifts .
but Uri@@ ah slept at the door of the king 's house with all the servants of his lord , and went not down to his house .
and when David had called him , he did eat and drink before him ; and he made him drunk : and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord , but went not down to his house .
and the elders of his house arose , and went to him , to raise him up from the earth : but he would not , neither did he eat bread with them .
and she took a pan , and poured them out before him ; but he refused to eat . and Am@@ non said , Have out all men from me . and they went out every man from him .
and she had a garment of divers colours upon her : for with such robes were the king 's daughters that were vir@@ gins ap@@ pa@@ rel@@ led . then his servant brought her out , and bol@@ ted the door after her .
and they came and be@@ sieg@@ ed him in A@@ bel of B@@ eth @@@ -@@ @ ma@@ acha@@ h , and they cast up a bank against the city , and it stood in the t@@ rench : and all the people that were with Jo@@ ab batter@@ ed the wall , to throw it down .

the king also said unto them , Take with you the servants of your lord , and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mu@@ le , and bring him down to Gi@@ hon :
now therefore hold him not guil@@ tless : for thou art a wise man , and know@@ est what thou ough@@ test to do unto him ; but his ho@@ ar head bring thou down to the grave with blood .
and now I ask one petition of thee , deny me not . and she said unto him , S@@ ay on .

and he put five bases on the right side of the house , and five on the left side of the house : and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south .
then king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am sent Ad@@ or@@ am , who was over the tribute ; and all Israel st@@ oned him with stones , that he died . therefore king Re@@ ho@@ bo@@ am made speed to get him up to his ch@@ ari@@ ot , to flee to Jerusalem .

therefore said he , Take it up to thee . and he put out his hand , and took it .
and he said , Th@@ row her down . so they threw her down : and some of her blood was sprink@@ led on the wall , and on the horses : and he tro@@ de her under foot .
and all the people of the land went into the house of Ba@@ al , and brake it down ; his al@@ t@@ ars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly , and sle@@ w M@@ attan the priest of Ba@@ al before the al@@ t@@ ars . and the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD .
thou hast indeed sm@@ it@@ ten E@@ dom , and th@@ ine heart hath lifted thee up : glory of this , and tar@@ ry at home : for why shoul@@ dest thou med@@ dle to thy hurt , that thou shoul@@ dest fall , even thou , and Jud@@ ah with thee ?
for so it was , that the children of Israel had sin@@ ned against the LORD their God , which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt , from under the hand of Phar@@ o@@ ah king of Egypt , and had feared other gods ,
and they set them up images and gro@@ ves in every high hill , and under every green tree :
for through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Jud@@ ah , until he had cast them out from his presence , that Ze@@ de@@ ki@@ ah reb@@ elled against the king of Babylon .
so they took the king , and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Ri@@ b@@ lah ; and they gave judgment upon him .
and certain of them had the charge of the minist@@ ering vessels , that they should bring them in and out by tale .
and the three brake through the host of the Phil@@ ist@@ ines , and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem , that was by the gate , and took it , and brought it to David : but David would not drink of it , but poured it out to the LORD ,
therefore David inqui@@ red again of God ; and God said unto him , Go not up after them ; turn away from them , and come upon them over against the mul@@ berry trees .
and we will cut wood out of Lebanon , as much as thou shalt need : and we will bring it to thee in flo@@ ats by sea to J@@ op@@ pa ; and thou shall carry it up to Jerusalem .
but the LORD said to David my father , for@@ as@@ much as it was in th@@ ine heart to build an house for my name , thou did@@ st well in that it was in th@@ ine heart :
if they sin against thee , ( for there is no man which sin@@ neth not , ) and thou be angry with them , and deliver them over before their enemies , and they carry them away cap@@ tives unto a land far off or near ;
then will I pl@@ uck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them ; and this house , which I have sancti@@ fied for my name , will I cast out of my sight , and will make it to be a prover@@ b and a by@@ word among all nations .
for the Lev@@ ites left their suburbs and their possession , and came to Jud@@ ah and Jerusalem : for J@@ ero@@ bo@@ am and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest 's office unto the LORD :

and he set all the people , every man having his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple , along by the altar and the temple , by the king round about .
then all the people went to the house of Ba@@ al , and brake it down , and brake his al@@ t@@ ars and his images in pieces , and sle@@ w M@@ attan the priest of Ba@@ al before the al@@ t@@ ars .
and at the king 's commandment they made a chest , and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD .
and be not ye like your fathers , and like your brethren , which t@@ resp@@ assed against the LORD God of their fathers , who therefore gave them up to des@@ ol@@ ation , as ye see .

and the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem , and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold .
and some of the chief of the fathers , when they came to the house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem , offered freely for the house of God to set it up in his place :
now when E@@ z@@ ra had prayed , and when he had confessed , we@@ eping and casting himself down before the house of God , there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children : for the people we@@ pt very sore .
moreover I said unto the king , If it please the king , let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river , that they may convey me over till I come into Jud@@ ah ;
because it shut not up the doors of my mother 's womb , nor hid sorrow from mine eyes .
whose harvest the hungry e@@ at@@ eth up , and tak@@ eth it even out of the thor@@ ns , and the rob@@ ber sw@@ allow@@ eth up their substance .
even that it would please God to destroy me ; that he would let loose his hand , and cut me off !
hast thou not poured me out as milk , and cur@@ dled me like cheese ?
is it good that he should search you out ? or as one man mo@@ c@@ ket@@ h another , do ye so mo@@ ck him ?
the steps of his strength shall be stra@@ it@@ ened , and his own counsel shall cast him down .
he may prepare it , but the just shall put it on , and the innocent shall divide the silver .
then did he see it , and declare it ; he prepared it , ye@@ a , and searched it out .
lest ye should say , We have found out wisdom : God th@@ ru@@ st@@ eth him down , not man .
touching the Almighty , we C@@ AN@@ NOT find him out : he is excellent in power , and in judgment , and in plenty of justice : he will not aff@@ l@@ ict .
none is so fierce that dare stir him up : who then is able to stand before me ?
I laid me down and slept ; I aw@@ aked ; for the LORD sustained me .
I will both lay me down in peace , and sleep : for thou , LORD , only mak@@ est me dwell in safety .
destroy thou them , O God ; let them fall by their own coun@@ sels ; cast them out in the multitude of their trans@@ gres@@ sions ; for they have reb@@ elled against thee .
have mercy upon me , O LORD ; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me , thou that lif@@ test me up from the gates of death :
arise , O LORD , dis@@ appoint him , cast him down : deliver my soul from the wicked , which is thy sword :
thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation : and thy right hand hath Hol@@ den me up , and thy gentl@@ eness hath made me great .
then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind : I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets .
he deliver@@ eth me from mine enemies : ye@@ a , thou lif@@ test me up above those that rise up against me : thou hast delivered me from the violent man .
thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of th@@ ine anger : the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath , and the fire shall dev@@ our them .
lift up your heads , O ye gates ; even lift them up , ye everlasting doors ; and the King of glory shall come in .
for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion : in the secret of his tab@@ ern@@ acle shall he hide me ; he shall set me up upon a rock .
when my father and my mother for@@ sake me , then the LORD will take me up .
because they regard not the works of the LORD , nor the operation of his hands , he shall destroy them , and not build them up .
save thy people , and bless th@@ ine inheritance : feed them also , and lift them up for ever .
let them not say in their hearts , Ah , so would we have it : let them not say , We have swallowed him up .
but thou , O LORD , be mer@@ ciful unto me , and raise me up , that I may requ@@ ite them .
for thou art the God of my strength : why d@@ ost thou cast me off ? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy ?
how thou did@@ st drive out the he@@ a@@ then with thy hand , and plan@@ t@@ ed@@ st them ; how thou did@@ st aff@@ l@@ ict the people , and cast them out .
through thee will we push down our enemies : through thy name will we t@@ read them under that rise up against us .
shall not God search this out ? for he know@@ eth the secrets of the heart .
awake , why sleep@@ est thou , O Lord ? arise , cast us not off for ever .
he shall reward evil unto mine enemies : cut them off in thy truth .
mine enemies would daily swallow me up : for they be many that fight against me , O thou most High .
he shall send from heaven , and save from the repro@@ ach of him that would swallow me up . Sel@@ ah . God shall send forth his mercy and his truth .
before your pots can feel the thor@@ ns , he shall take them away as with a whir@@ l@@ wind , both living , and in his wrath .
sl@@ ay them not , lest my people forget : sc@@ atter them by thy power ; and bring them down , O Lord our shield .
wil@@ t not thou , O God , which had@@ st cast us off ? and thou , O God , which did@@ st not go out with our armies ?
they only consult to cast him down from his excell@@ ency : they delight in lies : they bless with their mouth , but they curse in@@ war@@ dly . Sel@@ ah .
for the zeal of th@@ ine house hath eaten me up ; and the repro@@ aches of them that repro@@ ached thee are fallen upon me .
let not the water@@ flood over@@ flow me , neither let the deep swallow me up , and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me .
but I am poor and sor@@ row@@ ful : let thy salvation , O God , set me up on high .
thou , which hast sh@@ ew@@ ed me great and sore troubles , shalt quick@@ en me again , and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth .
O God , why hast thou cast us off for ever ? why do@@ th th@@ ine anger smoke against the sheep of thy past@@ ure ?
he made a way to his anger ; he spared not their soul from death , but gave their life over to the pesti@@ l@@ ence ;
so I gave them up unto their own hearts ' lust : and they walked in their own coun@@ sels .
they have said , Come , and let us cut them off from being a nation ; that the name of Israel may be no more in rem@@ embrance .
I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up : while I suffer thy terr@@ ors I am distracted .
thy fierce wrath go@@ eth over me ; thy terr@@ ors have cut me off .
they shall bear thee up in their hands , lest thou d@@ ash thy foot against a stone .
when I said , My foot sli@@ pp@@ eth ; thy mercy , O LORD , held me up .
and he shall bring upon them their own ini@@ qu@@ ity , and shall cut them off in their own w@@ ick@@ edness ; ye@@ a , the LORD our God shall cut them off .
because of th@@ ine indignation and thy wrath : for thou hast lifted me up , and cast me down .
the sun ar@@ is@@ eth , they gather themselves together , and lay them down in their dens .
wil@@ t not thou , O God , who hast cast us off ? and wil@@ t not thou , O God , go forth with our hosts ?
hold thou me up , and I shall be safe : and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually .
then they had swallowed us up quick , when their wrath was kind@@ led against us :
let burning co@@ als fall upon them : let them be cast into the fire ; into deep pits , that they rise not up again .
let us swallow them up alive as the grave ; and whole , as those that go down into the pit :
every wise woman buil@@ det@@ h her house : but the foolish pl@@ uc@@ ket@@ h it down with her hands .
counsel in the heart of man is like deep water ; but a man of understanding will draw it out .
the rich man is wise in his own conce@@ it ; but the poor that hath understanding search@@ eth him out .
for if they fall , the one will lift up his fellow : but w@@ oe to him that is alone when he fall@@ eth ; for he hath not another to help him up .
be not righteous over much ; neither make thy@@ self over wise : why shoul@@ dest thou destroy thy@@ self ?
that which is far off , and exceeding deep , who can find it out ?
I have put off my coat ; how shall I put it on ? I have washed my feet ; how shall I def@@ ile them ?
who is this that com@@ eth up from the wilderness , leaning upon her beloved ? I raised thee up under the apple tree : there thy mother brought thee forth : there she brought thee forth that bare thee .
and the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of Mi@@ dian at the rock of O@@ re@@ b : and as his rod was upon the sea , so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt .
stay yourselves , and wonder ; cry ye out , and cry : they are drun@@ ken , but not with wine ; they stag@@ ger , but not with strong drink .
the work@@ man mel@@ t@@ eth a gra@@ ven image , and the g@@ old@@ sm@@ ith spread@@ eth it over with gold , and cast@@ eth silver chains .
it is he that sit@@ t@@ eth upon the circle of the earth , and the inhabitants thereof are as gras@@ shop@@ pers ; that stret@@ ch@@ eth out the heavens as a curtain , and spread@@ eth them out as a tent to dwell in :
I have raised him up in righteousness , and I will direct all his ways : he shall build my city , and he shall let go my cap@@ tives , not for price nor reward , sa@@ ith the LORD of hosts .
behold , the Lord GO@@ D will help me ; who is he that shall condemn me ? lo , they all shall wax old as a garment ; the moth shall eat them up .
for the moth shall eat them up like a garment , and the worm shall eat them like wool : but my righteousness shall be for ever , and my salvation from generation to generation .
and judgment is turned away backward , and justice stand@@ eth af@@ ar off : for truth is fallen in the street , and equity C@@ AN@@ NOT enter .
