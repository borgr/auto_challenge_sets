from 1989 , political and economic changes have been fundamental and more far @@@ -@@ @ reaching than any in the past .
this drop in employment has been accompanied by a reduction in the labour force , and many people who were previously in the labour market are now out of it .
vocational schools provided education and training for the equivalent of grades from 9 or 10 to 12 .
as vocational education was always perceived as a continuation of general education , there was often a pre @@@ -@@ @ dominance of general secondary school subjects in vocational education programmes which left too little scope for the vocational theory subjects .
furthermore , an additional financial burden was added to the state budget due to the withdrawal of companies from their former involvement in training .
training took place within a dual system where the vocational school was often part of a state @@@ -@@ @ owned company .
the qualifications of the three groups of teachers and trainers / masters represented a significant barrier to the development of the vocational education system .
the number of people below 25 years of age who are registered as unemployed exceeds the average unemployment rate of the given country .
more specifically , the situation with respect to drop @@@ -@@ @ outs from both compulsory and post@@ compulsory education is as follows :
there is a lack of measures to tackle the issue of an increasing rate of drop @@@ -@@ @ outs ( 9.@@ 2 % in 1997 compared to 8.4 % in 1996 ) from vocational schools .
the rate of drop @@@ -@@ @ outs from the general education path at secondary level was 1.@@ 44 % in 1995 , while the one from the secondary technical / vocational education path was 4.@@ 84 % .
in addition , ministries of labour that have often emerged from ministries formerly in charge of social affairs ( health and pension schemes , etc . ) have assumed responsibilities for training / retraining of the unemployed .
however , the number of schools and teachers who benefited from these programmes is relatively limited , in particular in bigger countries ( e.g. 35 vocational schools out of more than 1,000 in Poland ) 8 .
■ the drafting of policy papers on the main directions of vocational education and training reforms and the adoption , in most countries of the region , of new laws regulating specific aspects of the work of vocational education institutions .
the result of the first phase was a rather fragmented legal framework , reflecting the lack of a coherent approach towards vocational education and training as a system .
as mentioned earlier , the development of a comprehensive policy framework , setting out the broader vocational education and training reform strategy , is a prerequisite for elabor@@ ating a coherent legal basis for vocational education and training .
however , qualification standards , teacher training , quality issues , vocational education and training research , counselling and guidance and private provision are not regulated .
continuing vocational education and training is regulated by the Law on Voc@@ ational Education and Training , the Law on Non @@@ -@@ @ For@@ mal Ad@@ ult Education ( June 1998 ) and the Law on Support of the Un@@ employed ( February 1996 ) .
the sector is regulated by separate decrees of both the Ministry of National Education and Ministry of Labour and Social Policy which do not suggest a coherent policy framework .
the 1996 Act on Employment represents an up @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ date legal framework that sets out the main guidelines for employment and labour market policies in the Slovak Republic .
the Employment and Un@@ employment Insurance Act ( 1990 ) with amendments ( 1998 ) provides for training / retraining for specific groups , e.g. long @@@ -@@ @ term unemployed , reflecting EU employment policy areas .
in most countries , state funds for initial vocational education and training are provided by the ministries of education and sector ministries involved and those for training / retraining of unemployed adults by the ministries of labour .
a debate on the establishment of a Voc@@ ational Training Fund to which employers are supposed to contribute is on going .
in the European Union social dialogue ( even in the field of vocational training ) , is a consolidated but diversified reality and recognised as being at the heart of the European Union 's social legislation .
Hungary has been quicker than other Central and Eastern European countries in providing for a social dialogue on vocational education and training issues at both national lev@@ el@@ through the National Voc@@ ational Training Council - and local levels - through the county councils .
however , since the formation of the new government in 1998 , there are positive indications for the development of a social dialogue at national level .
specific types of data are either not collected at all or are not provided in a format that would allow education planners to respond . in general , there is a lack of targeted information , e.g. :
even where this general labour market information is available , it may not be sufficiently analysed for vocational education and training purposes .
with the exception of very few countries , there is a lack of co @@@ -@@ @ operation between the different actors who could play a major role in ensuring the link between vocational education and training and the labour market .
only recently , a number of Central and Eastern European countries have begun to establish the national institutions and mechanisms that would enable them to leave continuous innovation to schools .
additional pressure arises from the need to provide for a transparency of qualifications with those acquired in other countries , particularly the EU Member States .

experience gained in other countries shows that the development of both new types of learning organisation and new types of management skills normally requires a timeframe of at least a decade .
perhaps the most important reform issue in teacher training is the training of the trainers themselves .
there is a considerable degree of confusion and uncertainty as to the meaning of the concept of continuing training .
respective means for small and medium @@@ -@@ @ sized enterprises are much more limited , if not completely non @@@ -@@ @ existent .
following on from the initiated reforms , the Central and East European countries are facing the following challenges which will have a major impact on their vocational education and training systems :
■ a credible research base helping vocational education and training institutions respond to changes in the structure of jobs and skills , and , last but not least ,
■ adjusting the existing school infrastructure and programmes to the new economic priorities ;
according to the Labour Force Survey 2nd quarter 1998 , 40 % of the registered unemployed have not acquired any labour market qualifications ( primary school leav@@ ers ) .
groups at risk of social exclusion include the low qualified , long @@@ -@@ @ term unemployed , people living on social benefits or pensions and people in rural areas .

concept , data collection and checking : - Elena D. Dmitri@@ eva ­ Gos@@ kom@@ stat of Russia .
this publication also constitutes the precondition and starting base for a regular exchange of data between Gos@@ kom@@ stat and Euro@@ stat , as agreed upon by the two organis@@ ation@@ s. tions .
Russia and the EU Member States - Statistical comparison 1990 ­ 96 o ho is a joint publication of Gos@@ kom@@ stat of Russia and Euro@@ stat , the Statistical Office of the European Commun@@ ities .
data are presented in about 100 tables and 60 graphs , and a large part is dedicated to methodological issues .
the administrative , logistic and financial aspects of the seminar were ensured by CE@@ SD @@@ -@@ @ Commun@@ aut@@ aire , ( Euro@@ stat 's implementing agency ) .
it is the reason for which this seminar takes place at a high level , that is to say , at the strategic level , the upper management level in your national statistical institute .
finally , this seminar is part of the T@@ AC@@ IS program for which Euro@@ stat is attempting to organize cooperation with the Commonwealth of Independent States , and Euro@@ stat 's role within T@@ AC@@ IS is coordinated with the role played by other international organizations .
I am going to speak about the environment in which statistical computing is finding itself in the European Union and where it will find itself in the next ten years within the information society .
the second category of people who can benefit from the information society are creative entrepreneurs .
there is also the capacity to become more efficient , more transparent , and more rapidly responsive to requests through this high technology .
enabling the market to create capacity for various suppliers or equipment , to communicate one with another , are also very important aspects .
we already have countries such as Denmark whose public administration is widely computer@@ ised and has a high level of privacy protection .
it is what is called information highway ; it is what enables us to exchange not only voices but also images and data , the whole idea of multimedia communications .
you have all come to Luxembourg to work together and not only is it a long task , but we also have language problems .
it is being developed right now . the idea is to have , three years from now , 10 % of all public ten@@ dering being done through this electronic ten@@ dering .
this means that your infrastructure should be examined and adjusted to this revolution .
the question from all I have said is , What is relevant now to the national information systems of your countries ? ( tab 8 )
the leap can be made to the next generation , that is , electronic data transmission and so on . your systems have to be changed dramatically .
the second constraint , a financial constraint , is linked to the first constraint .
producing official statistics encompasses a range of well @@@ -@@ @ known processes , all of which should be aided by IT .
when the dis@@ ket@@ te is returned to Dan@@ marks St@@ ati@@ sti@@ k , the respondent has already entered the data and has been confronted with in@@ consist@@ encies and apparent errors .
Dan@@ marks St@@ ati@@ sti@@ k makes use of the CP@@ R , tax registers , wage registers , social benefits registers , a central register of buildings and dwell@@ ings , and many more .
for many years , dissemination has largely taken the form of books , or other publications in print , and this is still the case even though things are now changing .
the increase in demand for statistics on electronic dissemination media has been somewhat slower than expected ten years ago , and consequently the development of these media has not gone far .
the concentration of skilled staff will create an environment that supports professionalism and helps the systems analysts and the programmers to keep up their skills .
according to the author 's experience , a large degree of decentr@@ alisation is advisable . the statistical branches should command the computer specialist resources necessary to develop their own systems .
information should be inter@@ changed and processed in a way that is expedient to the whole system .
tasks , products , organization of the Institute Comp@@ uting in the IN@@ SE@@ E
for us , information on how the collection and processing of statistical information is organised is most useful .
in the first half of 1994 , at the L@@ ingu@@ istic University , 20 of our staff attended foreign language courses .
therefore , we are looking for ways of dealing with these problems using other sources , including loans to our state and any other aid that can be provided by western countries .
there should be a number of people who manage the methods , that is , design and implement the master plans mentioned earlier for projects .
for example , someone who is a specialist in operating systems differs from someone who is a specialist in organizational systems .
the design of computer assisted interviews looks very much like the design of a traditional computer program .
one of the great advantages of a questionnaire as a knowledge domain is that the rules ( the " knowledge " ) governing it are often very explicit .
finally , after some post str@@ ati@@ fication stage the results of the survey should be tab@@ ulated and published .
in my opinion , one of the reasons for this lack of popularity might be their often un@@ friendly , main@@ frame oriented , user interfaces .
setting a short deadline of say a year for the first version often helps to get the priorities better in line .

servers can sometimes monopol@@ ize the operations . the Power PCs developed jointly by IBM , Apple , and Motorola could offer an alternative .
my second remark refers to distributed processing , which , in practice , may use more than two platforms .
Lithuania is a country in transition and data collection is an important operation .
decentralization could be recommended for larger countries , but not for those of the size of Lithuania , which is smaller than the Russian Federation , Kazakhstan , and Kyrgy@@ stan .
in eastern European countries there is usually little talk about software prices , since they are either produced in@@ house or obtained from " other sources . "
changing to a down@@ sized UNIX system is probably cheaper . here we should discuss minimum requirements for starting a new system .

how are the observation data processed and stored ? how are the statistics presented and disseminated ?
a key element in this model is the setting up of a European reference environment , which is illustrated on a conceptual level in figure 3.5 .
as part of the DS@@ IS programme , Euro@@ stat proposed to its partners that work on such harmonization should begin .
on these mini @@@ -@@ @ systems programs could be used for easy transfer to LAN@@ s ( local area networks ) , and in the end you will be at the same spot as us .
- PC / LAN is suitable only if second@@ hand equipment is made available to the CIS offices through programmes such as T@@ AC@@ IS@@ .@@ PC / LAN has a big advantage in software .
on the basis of ILO recommendations , a methodology has been established for determining indicators of the economically active population and unemployment .
in this context , questions connected with changes to the set of indicators , and rational methods for selecting and processing them require further examination .
in this connection Euro@@ stat can give us a good deal of support by organising events like this seminar .
each of these levels typically uses one of the above @@@ -@@ @ mentioned processing methods or , depending on the situation , all three together .
the computer system of the Ukrainian Ministry of Statistics within the structure of the computer system of the former Soviet U@@ mon had a number of positive and negative features .
the organs of the Ministry of Statistics and the Main Comp@@ uting Centre are liked by a single LAN known as Hy@@ pers@@ et so as to create a single information area .
at regional level , the IV@@ SS encompasses the regional statistical institutes and the statistical institute of the City of Kiev ( 26 institutes in all ) .
the district statistical department 's LAN runs on a Net@@ ware Lite operating system for peer @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ peer networks , which makes it possible to use a non @@@ -@@ @ dedicated file server and to incorporate an additional work station .
planning should not take years ; an intermediate set of objectives should be considered .
Germany , France , the United Kingdom , and Italy would be ideal partners for particular types of statistics . contact persons would be needed to " give the partnership a face . "
the St@@ ati@@ sti@@ sch@@ es Bundes@@ am@@ t is far from reaching that level , but it earns a few million de@@ ut@@ sche marks .
this should be built in from the outset , otherwise you risk setting up a system which will lose credibility because of network break@@ downs .
the second type of risk concerns theft of your individual data , and here I am basing my remarks on what Mr Fran@@ ch@@ et said yesterday evening on the anxiety of the European countries to protect people 's private lives .
not withstanding this fact , it is possible , in my opinion , to state , in a rather general way , that the current situation of statistical computing systems of NIS has some important drawbacks .
high centr@@ alisation Systems a ) a strong central computing department i ) which concentrates most of the equipment and staff in inform@@ atics ; ii ) which is responsible for collecting and processing the different statistics .
the Netherlands has one central office with two buildings and no regional or district levels .
the questions arisen by Mr Vil@@ ares are particularly relevant to us .
according to existing legislation in Ukraine , all information must be submitted to the statistical organs , which violates the industrial secrecy principle .
I refer to the point mentioned by Mr Hol@@ der and agree with him : statistical change should start with the organization of small working groups .
as M. Vil@@ ares observed , statistics in CIS countries continue in a certain direction because there has not been a structured reform .
however I believe that the information you have about our system is not completely updated .
a few months ago in Central Asia the situation was as Mr Vil@@ ares has described it .
however , in order to implement our reforms we need funds .
the transformation of the political , social and economic relations con@@ stituting the environment of the Hungarian statistical system poses new requirements , partly concerning the contents of statistics , and partly the functioning of the statistical service and its legal rules .
with the acceleration of inflation and the growing differences in the society there is high demand for information on living standards , unemployment , CPI , minimum subsistence level .
the financial report of the firms will no longer serve as a basis for the compilation of various economic statistics , first of all National Accounts .
to meet the mentioned new requirements it was necessary to make some adjustment in the organisation of the H@@ CS@@ O .
- D@@ ue to the privatisation and the change of the total economic system , the number of businesses increases to a multiple of the previously existing ones .
- For using up @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ date statistical methods the stati@@ sti@@ cians need to have direct access to the databases .
- In the Regional Offices they did not have H@@ W / S@@ w to be able to service the information dissemination demands expected by the local governments .
it is necessary to grow the efficiency of data processing systems :
- initiate standards in data management and system development as well as in the field of unified identification , description and documentation of statistical indicators , nom@@ encl@@ atures and for the naming conventions in the data bases ,
- design and development of the metadata base for the description of the elements of the statistical data system ( indicators , nom@@ encl@@ atures , data editing criteria of data collection , entities of data base etc . ) ,
- education and support for the E@@ DP specialists and stati@@ sti@@ cians for using new software elements and techniques ( PCs , SAS , DB@@ MS , end@@ user tools etc . ) ,
the transition into a market economy created numerous socio @@@ -@@ @ economic changes that , by the end of the ' 80s made unavoidable the re @@@ -@@ @ thinking and upgrading of the Hungarian statistical system .
as the result of a long ten@@ dering , evaluation and preparing period the installation was finished on 16 . December 199@@ 3. by the system wide acceptance .
the stati@@ sti@@ cians and IT experts have to work more closely together for the new statistical information system ..
finally there is an annual publication plan of the H@@ CS@@ O , which is coordinated by the Pub@@ l@@ ication and Dis@@ sem@@ ination Department .
first of all there is a must to write and implement some stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed data capture programs taking into consideration the Oracle tools , instead of the more than 100 unique programs .
it is essential to define the data base management concept where we have to ensure the protection of the individual data and the open access to all publicly interested , aggregate information .
on the base of the new techniques we created the Publishing section which has the responsibility to define the forms and standards of the publications and to take over step by step the editorial activity from the subject @@@ -@@ @ matter departments .
the second part is the migration of the application systems , which means the transformation of the programs where the application can be used more or less on the new platform .
the third part is the problem of the newly developed applications , where we have to solve these tasks in the new environment .
the resource has to be taken into consideration first of all as the internal capacity of the Office .
in that context we have to make the priorities among the problems and to find the elements of the migration which can be solved by outside experts .
for that purpose we have to find the financial sources too , taken into consideration that the parallel running of the two systems occurs extra costs also .
implementation C@@ AN@@ NOT be a one @@@ -@@ @ off action . no development is going to remain static for 3 years .
we , w@@ ester@@ ners , were concerned with decentralized control , meaning making users responsible for their own computing systems .
a new monthly retail trade survey was introduced with the aid of the Canad@@ ians . the basic idea was to introduce a combination of a list and an area framework .
it is the only way to go about this exercise because of the lack of a business register .
the T@@ AC@@ IS programme does not cover major financing of equipment for statistical offices .
in discussing different transition scenari@@ i special care has been taken to consider limited resources available as well as a difficult context .
planners do not know whether there is enough capital when they start the process .
as time goes by , planners have re @@@ -@@ @ cycle through the same processes .
but technology development and the need for greater flexibility to respond to rapid changes in the economy have changed the situation .
thus , there is a sort of time @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ market issue dealing with our strategies .
in the United Kingdom , strategies are read@@ ju@@ sted every year and new ones are developed every 34 years .
however users should be involved in the design and testing of prototypes now .
the total gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the United Kingdom is about USD 800 billion . the cost of the British statistical
at the CS@@ O , we continue using min@@ ic@@ om@@ put@@ ers because the business register of companies alone occupies over 10 gi@@ gab@@ ytes now and will increase to nearly 20 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
but you should be prepared to change the architecture whenever it is needed , either for technical reasons or in order to meet changing needs .
my next point concerns the necessity of stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ation of tools within our offices .
the dr@@ y@@ ness of statistics and their reputation for technical complexity mean that they have to be " brought " to the user and that any reluctance to use them has to be overcome .
it obt@@ ains its raw materials from the Member States , where all the public bodies concerned by a Community policy send their data to Euro@@ stat .
each of Euro@@ stat 's author direc@@ torates is in contact with the national body or bodies whose data it deals with .
the authors create the statistical documents , which are , as it were , semi @@@ -@@ @ finished products that are sometimes difficult for a non @@@ -@@ @ specialist to use directly .
when the manuscript is a statistical document , the Unit 's role is confined to supervis@@ ing the transmission of the document .

the information system developed by Euro@@ stat is intended to provide a basis for drawing up , monitoring and assessing Community policies .
Euro@@ stat considers that this type of document , which has a clearly defined objective , may possibly be of interest to persons outside the Commission , such as the Commission 's partners , national authorities , the relevant professional groups , experts etc .
the European institutions and privileged users are informed of what statistical documents and publications are available by means of an annual catalogue and a monthly bulletin ( Just published ) .
if the process of dissemination to the end customer is carefully tracked , it can be seen that there is almost always an intermediary between Euro@@ stat and the end user .
- a modular approach to development : the applications must be developed on a step by step basis for reasons of cost and control ,
to carry out such an operation successfully , it must be possible to integrate a large number of parameters such as :
everyone has dreamed of being able , one day , to start with a clean sheet and re @@@ -@@ @ do everything from the beginning .
in statistical institutes , the tendency is generally towards limitation of the size o@@ fin@@ formation systems , in other words towards the decentr@@ alisation of processing power and in the direction of client / server architectures with access via workstations connected to the networks .
in past years , some enterprises have played the " down@@ sizing " card , favour@@ ing the processing of information by decentr@@ alised and personal systems .
at the technical level , the phenomenon has been has been greatly slowed down by the lack of software and tools for the crucial applications and by the problems of security and back @@@ -@@ @ up .
the fame database allows the storage of a large number of different OB@@ J@@ EC@@ TS , with a manipulation language which has a wide range of facilities for the treatment of time .
its graphical capabilities are limited in the main@@ frame versions . it is available on Main@@ frame platforms , UNIX and PC Windows , with more or less processing capacity .
each system has to be supplied to the user with an extra layer of programs allowing the attachment of specific functions for the integration of metadata .
to achieve a high level of success with the implementation of a C@@ ASE tool , it must be viewed and selected as a management tool and not as a technical tool .
another key factor in the introduction of a C@@ ASE tool is the putting in place of a systematic training policy for users as well as developers .
it is therefore usual to eliminate those which are too risky , as well as those which are not viable .
these same computers also foster a variety of packages for analysis which have different capabilities and strengths even if there is considerable overlap .
in the area of application driven technology , one must also mention the arrival on the market of high capacity optical storage devices and the software products that accompany them .
a final significant major trend has nothing to do with statistics per se but is already having an impact on S@@ IS is Statistical Confi@@ denti@@ ality .
most democratic countries have laws defining the rules of confidentiality for individual data provided to government and company administrations .
as described earlier , statistical data requirements are becoming more detailed both in classification and geographic terms .
provision of pre @@@ -@@ @ aggregated summary data to a statistical agency becomes very rapidly an impedi@@ ment to the usage of the data .
another domain which generates food for thought is " Hyper@@ text " although how this could be applied in general in a S@@ IS environment is not completely clear .
it is the increasing power of these PC 's which is enabling us to hide more and more of the complexity of the pat@@ ch@@ work behind .
this mis@@ match miti@@ gates for some sort of central inform@@ atics infrastructure to enable the products to be derived from a variety of sources .
Euro@@ stat has for sometime been developing a proposal for its future structure to try to face these challenges .
it can be fairly readily seen that the architecture proposed can be organised in a way which simplifies the development of solutions to a great number of problems .
" reference " consists of at least the catalogue and ideally , data storage capability .
the " pal@@ lets " contain a description of what they contain and a resum@@ é of this is stored in a catalogue of warehouse contents .
as the European Economic Area opens up , demands are increasing for a broader resource of reliable information to support decision making on issues such as social , financial and economical .
- In@@ corporation of statistical activities in the Fourth Framework Research Programme as an extension of work carried out previously in the doses programme .
the information to be collected for statistical purposes must always be present in the information systems of the economic operators involved in E@@ DI . in other words , the sources must never dry up .
the more advanced the user groups ' planning of their E@@ DI applications , the harder it will be to take statistical requirements into account .
investments in the design of messages that have already been standardized C@@ AN@@ NOT be simply written off , and requests for modification at that stage are unlikely to be favour@@ ably received .
one aspect of this cooperation is to give back to the economic operators aggregated statistics in the domain in which they operate .
this has been the case with the EC IN@@ TR@@ AS@@ T@@ AT regulation , where the E@@ DI message C@@ US@@ D@@ EC / IN@@ ST@@ AT@@ 17@@ is the specified standard .
- In@@ corporation of statistical activities in the Fourth Framework Research Programme as an extension of work carried out previously in the doses " programme
the aim of DS@@ IS is to establish a framework enabling all operators and users in the field of statistical information to cooperate more closely , at all levels .
without this framework , a very large number of projects relating to telem@@ atics Networks , both public and private , both European and in a larger geographical context , will inevitably advance without adequate coordination and cross @@@ -@@ @ fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ ation .
- definition and integration of E@@ DI messages , these E@@ DI messages will be based on ISO standards such
the main benefits of a network arise from using the value @@@ -@@ @ added services , such as application @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ application file transfer , routing and control mechanisms for file transfer .
the ST@@ AT@@ EL @@@ -@@ @ API has been designed to provide an interface that is intuitive for application developers ( C language ) used to the Unix or DOS operating systems .
the objective of Ser@@ t is to increase the competi@@ tivity of the European enterprises by reducing their administrative workload and by supplying them with better and more relevant business statistics .
the objective is to study , in the various countries of the Community and the EF@@ TA countries , the state of the art in the area of automated data collection in general , and particularly in electronic questionnaire .
the integration of these techniques in the general data processing flow of the enterprise is of particular relevance as the overall aim is to reduce the administrative workload of the enterprises .
taking into account the necessity for statistics on intra @@@ -@@ @ Community goods movements , a new collection system , called IN@@ TR@@ AS@@ T@@ AT , was set up .
one of the essential characteristics of the IN@@ TR@@ AS@@ T@@ AT system is its link to the tax system , as can be seen from the following .
- hardware and software provision for the responsible National Authorities in order to process electronic returns
the main objective was to raise the awareness of the future providers of the statistical IN@@ TR@@ AS@@ T@@ AT returns ( Provider of Statistical Information - P@@ SI ) and to provide them with optimal information for the implementation of the IN@@ TR@@ AS@@ T@@ AT Regulation in the administrative practice .
in 1994 , it is planned to extend the dissemination of the package in the Member States and to incorporate the telecommunication layer , in particular through ST@@ AT@@ EL .
this is a standard developed by one of the message development groups of the Western European UN / ED@@ IF@@ ACT Board : we / E@@ B @@@ -@@ @ MD@@ 6 Statistics .
the message C@@ US@@ D@@ EC / IN@@ ST@@ AT is derived from the C@@ US@@ D@@ EC message : the electronic message for the Single Administrative Document , the customs document in use for trade with Third Countries .
within the framework of ED@@ IC@@ OM , the Commission gave technical support by providing software and hardware for the handling of the returns : disk / FA@@ X project .
the main motivation for an information base of environmental policies is the need to enrich the available information with respect to socio @@@ -@@ @ economic driving forces of stress on the environment and on natural resources .
this control is a prerequisite to ensure the adequacy of the research activities with the user requirements , moreover their compatibility with the current activities to develop the European statistical information system .
the Chairman has the responsibility for coordinating the activities of the various Working Groups ( WG ) . he is assisted by 2 vice @@@ -@@ @ Cha@@ irs and a secretariat .
the national representatives are nominated by the National Statistical In@@ stitutes and must be endorsed by the national representative to UN / ECE W@@ P@@ 4 .
during these last 2 years , W@@ E / E@@ B @@@ -@@ @ MD@@ 6 has proved its creativity and its dynamism in tackling many activities and achieving quite tangible results :
security experts assume that they will rapidly increase in number in the near future , due to the au@@ g@@ mention of social problems such as unemployment , and of organised crime .
confidential data will be treated on dedicated secure machines accessible only by a limited number of persons and from a limited number of especially protected workstations .
we consider this programme important for many reasons known by you all : high quality statistics are needed for political and economic decision making .
therefore project conception has been placed as a priority for the first stage of the T@@ AC@@ IS cooperation programme .
T@@ AC@@ IS can make PCs or teaching tools available through an international call for tender .
though this assistance , we have to work on three lines : a ) methodology b ) technology c ) training of our staff .
training courses were very useful , however the are attended by economists and stati@@ sti@@ cians but not technicians and engineers in charge of@@ statistical computing .
first of all would like to express our thanks to the international organisation and to inform you of the progress made by Kazakhstan during the last two and a half past year .
our former structure met the needs of planned economy , the changes underway in the economic structure of our country requires that our tasks are changed accordingly .
the World Bank , the European Commission , and various other international bodies could be mobilized to support our efforts in this direction .
all these criteria must be considered to maintain and manage a statistical system that is reliable and can be used in the future .
one of the main indicators for this grouping is the per capita gross national product ( GNP ) in US dollars .
if a car is constructed bit by bit and there are difficulties in the process , it will be hard to make it run .
strategy FOR ST@@ AT@@ IST@@ ICAL COMP@@ UT@@ ING FOR THE CO@@ UN@@ TR@@ IES OF THE CIS problems that confront us today are much more basic and if we fail to solve them today , we shall not be able to build the future .
the provisions were designed 4 years ago and were based on parameters that were valid then . they now need to be adjusted to current circumstances .
it is simpler to build some small boxes that fit into the general framework than to build a huge system .
however , certain points such as seasonal adjustment can be considered across the board .
did you completely give up the old system or are you developing new methodology in parallel to the old ones ?
it would include work forecasts and productivity targets and explain how computer@@ ization will support statistical work to meet current needs .
if the office is successful , it can later negotiate with the World Bank and other organisations to obtain funds for other parts of the master plan .
previously , statistical offices in the EU carried out administrative tasks to assist the authorities in the management and supervision of public sector enterprises .
on the contrary , it is important to select topics for discussion , from where it should be possible to achieve the adequ@@ ated solution .
what is the " optimal " degree of decentr@@ alisation and what must be the role of the computer centre ?
how to integrate the statistical information system in the nation information system , and how can the experience of western nations in the field be useful for NIS countries ?
I think that we do not have to worry about staff : it is the only resource we have in sufficient quantity and which gives us the possibility to hope for success .
cou@@ l@@ d@@ n '@@ t Euro@@ stat or , even better , the EU , help us explain the basic responsibilities of a statistical office in a market economy to the CIS governments .
in this respect lessons could be learned from the experience of the Baltic countries , Poland , and Hungary , in doing away with the old systems and adapting to international standards .
this is why the PH@@ ARE and T@@ AC@@ IS programmes have been conceived , to support the first step towards a democratization of statistics .
another example is offered by the tractor plant in Minsk , which was practically the only tractor plant in all the USSR .
the country is full of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ isms as old fashioned systems which co @@@ -@@ @ exist with the new market economy , which is the new trend which we want to follow .
I intended to provoke this discussion to give you the opportunity to inform the international organisations about your real situation in support of request of financial assistance .
3.2 You should preferably select architectures which are easy to maintain , and as similar as possible .
will the best thing be to dismiss them , and add to the number of unemployed , which is a factor in the social dis@@ location in your countries ?
in The Netherlands , for example , the Central Bureau of Statistics has a staff strength of 2500 .
first of all , during this week I was reminded several times of an old Dutch saying , going back to the days of the large sailing ships .
around our harb@@ ours there used to be large groups of on@@ loo@@ kers , watching the ships man@@ oeu@@ vre into and out of the harbour , commenting about what the cap@@ tains ought to do and cri@@ ti@@ sizing them for wrong moves .
perhaps it would be a good idea to involve consultants from countries that have been through a similar process of development , such as Poland or Hungary .
a very rough estimate is , that the statistical offices of the European Union each year have about 1000 redundant , but fairly modern PC 's available ( 3@@ 86 and upward ) .
however , it is not an easy task , as we have found out when we installed a small computer network in the statistical office of Georgia .
it is not so much a matter of money as a matter of time , organisation and manpower .
many missions are undertaken by the western experts to the CIS , but there is often a duplication of efforts .
Euro@@ stat could probably facilitate the financing process by li@@ a@@ ising with the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , and other organizations .
you may not get there , but at least you will know in which direction to go .
political interventions with prime ministers , presidents and heads of states are needed , with the support of the EU to create a dialogue and assist you in getting out of the woods .
modem computers have to work with new projects and not be used to manage the old system with all its massive data . in this way , we will be more able to assist you .
strategy for statistical computing for the countries of the CIS Pro@@ ce@@ edings of the seminar for the heads of the statistical services of the Commonwealth of inde@@ pen ­ dent States - Luxembourg , 4 to 8 July 1994
the T@@ ac@@ is Programme is a European Community Initiative for the New Independent States and Mongolia which fo@@ sters the development of harmonious and prosperous economic and political links between the European Union and these partner countries .
the Programme is devoted to the transfer of know @@@ -@@ @ how towards economic transformation and the development of democracy .
the year 1994 has seen the development of initiatives which have provided a solid platform for T@@ AD@@ S to build on .
the Programme has also sharpen@@ ed its focus on a number of cross@@ sectoral Issues , Inclu@@ ding the promotion of democracy , the role of women and protection of the environment .
the governments in most of the New Independent States are still coping with the problems of establishing the mechanics of democratic government and building a new system of public administration and local government .
• industrial inter @@@ -@@ @ dependence • industrial ' mon@@ oc@@ ulture ' • central planning . command @@@ -@@ @ driven production • trade based on state orders . service sectors that are in their infancy .
the contracting back@@ log from earlier years and the Tim@@ e@@ Sp@@ an between commitments and contracting were thus significantly reduced .
in 1994 , the T@@ AD@@ S Programme committed a total of EC@@ U 4@@ 70 million to its partner countries , Inclu@@ ding EC@@ U 10 million for the T@@ ac@@ is Democracy Programme .
the Programme paid out EC@@ U 300@@ .@@ 3 million , an Incre@@ ase of 66 per cent from the previous year and 41 per cent more than the amount paid out over the three previous years together .
this means that of the total T@@ ac@@ is commitments , 61 per cent has now been contracted , and of the amount contracted 48 per cent has been paid .
however , It is only recently that the conditions have started to emerge , in terms of establishing management structures in each country , that allow substantial developments to be made In this area .
the Coordin@@ ating Un@@ its have become valid partners and useful counterparts for T@@ ac@@ is , representing an effective and credible liaison with the government authorities .
these changes , and T@@ AD@@ S ' operations in general , were presented in a series of high @@@ -@@ @ level meetings between the Parliament and the Commission , backed by an exchange of extensive Information .
privatisation remains a priority policy for the Armenian Government , although some nation@@ alised enterprises will have to continue operating under state control .
other T@@ ac@@ is initiatives design a model investment fund to attract capital In@@ to the economy , especially from the Diaspora .
in addition , a Commission for the Reform of the Public Administration is being developed to define the new legal and institutional framework .
the country 's energy sector has the potential to provide the impetus for overall economic advancement , but has suffered from a lack of Investment and from poor maintenance of the pipeline network .
in the absence of a privatisation plan approved by parliament , little formal privatisation has taken place , although a number of laws have been passed to facilitate the privatisation process .
the first part of the project aims to provide advice and practical support for the ministry charged with the development of small and medium @@@ -@@ @ sized enterprises ( SMEs ) to set up seven regional Enterprise Support Centres and train their staff .
four new projects are being launched In the transport sector in Belarus , aimed at developing the structure of transport systems and supporting their modernisation .
the project will address the technical considerations of road construction and maintenance -@@ techniques that Belarus can adopt to build roads that match European standards .
these are intended to support agricultural production increases through the provision of market information and the start @@@ -@@ @ up of two pilot projects to help underpin the expansion of fla@@ x production .
in particular , this involves establishing an environment in which private business can thrive and continue to build a source of tax revenues and hard currency .
it highlighted recent laws that should accelerate privatisation efforts and strengthen the focus on government reform and private sector development .
this funding will be applied to widen the support offered by the SM@@ E Development Agency and Business Communication Centre in Tbilisi - established with support from the T@@ ac@@ is Programme .
it has also supported small @@@ -@@ @ scale privatisation programmes and provided essential training for Ministry officials in order to prepare the launch of the vou@@ cher privatisation programme .
T@@ AC@@ IS support In 1994 was focused on three key areas , a shift from previous years when support was provided across a broader range of sectors . these three areas are
within the human resources sector , T@@ ac@@ is has focused on public administration reform , both by training individuals and providing policy advice to government .
increased prices for energy imports have been accompanied by a drastic fall in living standards - at least 70 per cent of the population is living below the Government 's no@@ tional poverty line .
the 1993 @@@ -@@ @ 1995 Indic@@ ative Programme identifies four priority sectors , with specific emphasis on food @@@ -@@ @ related reforms .
a second project valued at EC@@ U 1 million Is designed to lend support to the Business Communication Centre which offers guidance and advice on business issues to private sector businesses .
in addition , the Mongolian Centre for Scientific and Technological Information will be receiving T@@ ac@@ is finance to upgrade an education @@@ -@@ @ oriented information system .
the year was characterised by the establishment of the necessary operational framework to support the planned series of T@@ ac@@ is activities .
an Ag@@ ro@@ processing Advisory Centre will be incorporated in this agency to accelerate investment by SMEs in ag@@ ro@@ processing industries .
in Dar@@ khan , T@@ ac@@ is will determine ways to increase the efficiency and capacity of the district heating plant .
official unemployment reached 7.1 per cent of the working population by the end of the year , a rise of 1.6 per cent over the year .
under the 1994 budget , T@@ ac@@ is has committed a total of EC@@ U 150 million to federal and regional projects within the national programme with the Russian Federation .
in July 1994 a decree was released out@@ lining the second stage of privatisation .
some sales for cash and investment tenders took place towards the end of the year but land privatisation has not been widely implemented .
this approach has now shifted towards providing know @@@ -@@ @ how through advisory centres .
by expanding the awareness of modern economics within educational circles , it is hoped to promote a wider understanding of the free market economy .
an EC@@ U 14 million officers ' retraining programme , aiming to help discharged army officers to adapt to civilian life , continued in 1994 .
support for air traffic control was Identi@@ fied as a pressing need , and projects will encompass training for staff and instructors and advice on systems modernisation .
many projects In St. Petersburg which have been supporting the development of food retail distribution and farm restructuring came to fru@@ ition during 1994 .
its main objective is to fund civilian research projects and thereby help redirect weapon scientists and engineers to peaceful activities .
by the end of the year , EC@@ U 47 million had been committed for over 90 projects involving more than 5,000 scientists and engineers .
Turkmenistan 's ' National Programme for Den@@ ation@@ alisation and Priv@@ atisation ' envisages the privatisation of all small and medium @@@ -@@ @ sized enterprises within five years , as well as the Initi@@ al privatisation of large concerns .
help for small and medium @@@ -@@ @ sized enterprises ( SMEs ) is a strategic economic imperative .
the restructuring and privatisation of businesses is essential to make the enterprise sector a more powerful driving force in the country 's programme of economic regeneration .
further improvement in the programme is anticipated following a review , carried out in 1994 , of the previous three years ' programmes .
the country 's balance of payments position remains resolutely negative - reflecting Ukraine 's bureaucratic and fiscal constraints on exports and massive energy imports .
this establishment is helping Uzbek SMEs to Identi@@ fy foreign markets and export partners , potential joint ventures , and foreign investment sources with T@@ ac@@ is funding of EC@@ U 1.5 million .
one such initiative in operation which began in March 1994 , is directed at offering support services to farmers in their transition to private farming in the Gu@@ li@@ stan and Fer@@ gan@@ a ob@@ lasts ( EC@@ U 3 million ) .
the diversification of agricultural production away from cotton , the development of food@@ processing and packaging capabilities and the development of exports are priorities in the agricultural sector .
the policy and legal advice programme provides short@@ term advice on macroeconomic , economic and social policy , restructuring , institution building , and drafting of legislation .
since It is a dynamic process It is necessary for T@@ AD@@ S to adapt to ensure that the support it offers reflects the needs of the partner countries .
another area for consideration concerns the need to provide support in the important area of the development of small businesses .
funds contracted were almost as much as for the three previous years combined .
as part of the T@@ AD@@ S programming process , there are three steps which take the annual budget approved by the European Parliament through to the point where projects are implemented and funds disbur@@ sed .

this document attempts to simplify the task of NIS companies as they set up efficient sales force management by clari@@ fying their ideas on the subject and by indicating met@@ h ­ ods for reaching their objectives .
selling is a market@@ ing@@ 1 task that usually involves face @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ face contact with a cus ­ tom@@ er .
many people 's perception of a sales@@ man is that of a sl@@ ick , fast @@@ -@@ @ talking confidence trick ­ ster forcing unwanted products on innocent customers .
the sales@@ man 's task will differ according to the nature of the products , the complexity of the technology , the company 's size , the existing distribution channels , ( Figure 1 ) .
the buyer will appreciate the fact that the sales@@ person is taking the problem seriously and the sales@@ person will gain by having a clear and full understanding of what the problem really is .
this technique has the effect of maintaining the relationship between the par ­ ties and can be used as the starting point for the discussion when they next meet .
• being present at the time of delivery or calling soon after to ensure that customer is satisfied with purchase
the sales management process is divided into three main components : planning , Implementation , Performance Evaluation and Control .
the level of sales a company can expect can only be derived from an analysis of the market as a whole : the achievable sales potential must be compatible with the company 's goals , capabilities and resources .
the sales force manager should develop an individual skill building programme for the members of the sales force in relation with their existing strengths and weaknesses and his or her target skills .
it is important not only that sales@@ men be motivated , but that their efforts be chann@@ elled in a way that is consistent with the strategic marketing plan .
in a sense , sales managers do not motivate sales people : they ensure the conditions for sales people to motivate themselves .
a company 's order processing system should seek to avoid unnecessary written doc@@ u ­ ments and repetition of the same information processing activities .
all stages in order processing must be reviewed to ensure accurate and timely order ful ­ fil@@ ment .
a typical method is to fill out stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed , pre ­ printed forms with the cus ­ tom@@ er .
long term , repeat customers may be supplied with pre ­ printed order forms , on which only the number of units ordered needs to be filled out .
reducing personnel turnover and Im@@ proving sales force morale are also typical levers for profit improvement .

the current transition phase , from the former centr@@ alised and highly subsi@@ dis@@ ed system to a free market economy , has a strong influence on the development of the milk sector throughout the NIS countries .
dairy farms have to effect a complete re@@ organisation at each step of the milk production chain , with a view to making it more profitable , that is more efficient and more pro@@ du@@ c ­ tive .
dairy farming is practically non @@@ -@@ @ existent among private farmers because of the poor pr@@ of ­ itability of the activity : few have been motivated to start this type of farming and most of those who set up faced serious difficulties .
despite wide regional disparities , average annual milk output is 5,000 l / cow in the EU .
the principal reason for the regular increase in milk production in the EU is a result of the Im@@ pro@@ vement In feeding conditions which preceded genetic improvements .
the segm@@ entation of farms into separate activities ( farming , cattle breeding , mechan@@ isa ­ tion and management ) did not make it possible to improve the situation .
the large size of the herds , the lack of training or profit @@@ -@@ @ sharing incentives for the workers have not fav@@ oured the search for solutions to improve the productivity and profitability of the dairy farms .
the Agricultural Research Centre , utterly removed from reality in the field , has been unable to propose any alternatives to the new economic situation .
the inputs ( cereals , fuel , etc . ) used to produce milk have a disproportionately high cost in relation to the price of the milk .
on the other hand , to increase milk pro@@ du@@ c ­ tion output and profitability , it is necessary to re@@ organise the cattle re@@ aring and feeding systems so that less cere@@ al and less fuel are used .
in the majority of NIS countries , animal feed relies on a production system that is very expensive in terms of inputs ( fuel , mechan@@ isation , concentrates ) .
they are often between 2 and 10 months late in paying for the products provided by the farms ( milk , meat , cereals ) .
indeed , on these farms , most of the cereals are given to the cattle owing to the poor nutritional quality of the for@@ age and therefore C@@ AN@@ NOT be used to generate cash income .
the area between the two curves represents the output deficit of the cows .
after filling , the sil@@ o is covered over with straw ( not naturally air or water@@ tight ) and then with earth .
those responsible are not aware of the considerable losses ( 40 to 60 % ) that occur in the piles of sil@@ age .
in effect , neither an enhancement in the milk quality nor a sound level of profitability in the d@@ ai@@ ries can be guaranteed .
in some cases , the administration still opposes reductions in livestock even if there are too many animals in relation to the for@@ age land available and even if they are hardly ( or not at all ) productive .
everywhere there is land that C@@ AN@@ NOT be mechan@@ ised ( f@@ ens , irregular valleys , etc . ) or that has become bar@@ ren .
this is represented almost exclusively by the cows belonging to collective farm workers ( 300 to 600 families , including retired people per collective farm ) .
these " cattle breeders " are hostile to any change because this type of farming is possible with almost no expenditure or investment .
any new genetic investment would be useless within the present feeding pattern .
thus , it can be concluded that the genetic capacity of both the collectively and privately owned dairy cows is in the region of 4,000 and 6,000 lit@@ res of milk / cow / year .
milk can only be produced on the basis of the protein and cere@@ al intake ( naturally poor in protein ) and the cows ' own bodily reserves ( which are often already reduced at the start of the winter ) .
conversely , cows owned privately by the farm workers receive the best ha@@ y , harvested in good time on land belonging to the collective farm , be@@ ets ( sugar or fodder varieties ) , cereals and pe@@ as taken from the collective farms .
milk production is a principal cause of bankruptcy and depletion of farm capital on these collective farms especially since state subsidies have ceased .
unfortunately , UN@@ AT ­ trac@@ tive wages on collective farms have led to an exodus from rural areas by young people towards St @@@ -@@ @ Petersburg and a drop in the milk output per worker .
it has more forests than the whole of the European Union and under its soils are en@@ or ­ MO@@ Us reserves of oil and gas .
the best collective farms workers have chosen to go and work on the oil ri@@ gs in the North where the salaries are much more attractive .
this region enjoys a climate that is well suited to dairy farming ; the soils are less rich than those found in Ki@@ rov@@ og@@ rad and Kursk but the rainfall here is more abundant ( with 600 to 800 mm ) .
the current system for producing milk has been inherited from the Soviet economic sys ­ tem whose objective was not necessarily to make collective farms profitable .
transformation of the system of production in operation comes about by following a cer ­ tain number of technical recommendations .
the technical recommendations cover : • transformation of the for@@ age system • transformation of the cattle hus@@ band@@ ry system • transformation of the management system .
the easiest successful association to achieve is : per@@ ennial ry@@ e ­ grass ( PR@@ G ) + white clo@@ ver ; it is also the association which gives rise to the greatest pro ­ duction of milk per hectare .
in order to achieve this , late , more productive strains of PR@@ G must be used which are easier to crop at the right stage , ( see annex 1 : stages of fodder grass farming ) .
it has the capacity , following a short trim@@ ming back ( either by gra@@ zing or cutting ) which destroys future ears during the shooting stage to only produce leaf@@ y fol@@ i@@ age .
the grass@@ lands ' per@@ enni@@ ality is closely linked at the same time to the climate , the species of for@@ age present and the method of grass@@ land farming ( explained below ) .
nit@@ ro@@ genous fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ er dressing is unnecessary because the white clo@@ ver provides the new past@@ ure with large quantities of nitrogen absorbed from the atmosphere ( 300 to 400 kg / ha / year ) .
efficient use of the gra@@ zing will also guarantee the durability of the temporary past@@ ure over a period of 15 @@@ -@@ @ 20 years while in the con@@ verse situation it would not last more than a year .
the enhancement of the fodder produced in these new past@@ ures and of the intake is only possible if the herd is very well managed on a technical level .
the goal is to have not less than 75 % cows of a herd pregnant within 110 days after an autumn or early winter cal@@ ving .
with the Introduction of new feeding systems , the cows will be able to realise their gen@@ et ­ ic capacity .
gra@@ zing on PR@@ G @@@ -@@ @ WC can provide in the climatic conditions and with the soils of the NIS between 15 to 35 tonnes of grass / ha / year , i.e. 3 to 6@@ 1. of dry matter / ha .
a dairy pilot project was implemented in Pol@@ ot@@ ch@@ any ( situated 90 km north of Minsk and 60 km from the frontier with Lithuania .
the area intended for dairy farming ( 145 ha ) was cho ­ sen for its proximity to the buildings .
associated with the be@@ et ( rich in energy ) , these pe@@ as that are rich in protein ( 22 % ) are perfectly suited for cows producing more than 25 lit@@ res of milk / day at the beginning of lac@@ tation .
gra@@ zing was stopped at the end of October because of the bearing capacity of the soil ( during the rainy period ) .
in December 1994 , this herd was fed at will ( 10 kg / day ) and ex@@ cl@@ u ­ sively on the sil@@ age of field pe@@ as @@@ -@@ @ fodder o@@ ats and with be@@ ets .
at the same time , their fellow cows that remained in the kol@@ kho@@ ze cow sheds produced no more than 3 lit@@ res of milk / day on average .
" pilot project " framework The " Nov@@ o@@ ie @@@ -@@ @ V@@ rem@@ ia " so@@ v@@ kho@@ z provided a portion of the " Nov@@ o@@ ie @@@ -@@ @ Si@@ el@@ o " farm with 14@@ 6 ha of land situated around a cow shed holding 104 dairy cows .
96 ha end of May 1995 ( under@@ se@@ eded with pe@@ a @@@ -@@ @ o@@ ats )
the dairy herd ( 104 cows ) The herd lived on this farm and the cal@@ vings were grouped at the end of the winter ( February @@@ -@@ @ March @@@ -@@ @ April ) .
" pilot project " framework A T@@ ac@@ is project was established in the region of Tyumen ( Russian Federation ) in July 1994 .
the recommendations for introducing a more profitable system of milk production were applied on a so@@ v@@ kho@@ z in the surrounding area of Tyumen : P@@ lo@@ d@@ ov@@ o@@ i@@ é .
support of " the pilot project " The cultivated areas comprised of : • PR@@ G + WC for gra@@ zing ( under@@ see@@ ding of field pe@@ a @@@ -@@ @ fodder o@@ ats at the end of May 1996 ) : 280 ha .
during these three weeks the development of the crop ( fall in the dig@@ esti@@ bility of the fibre ) was studied and the results are presented in the table below :
the dairy herd ( 200 cows planned ) The reduction of the dairy stock to 200 cows , eliminating the worst 180 had not been achieved by the end of the project .
they clearly show that : • the PR@@ G and the WC withstand the Siberian winter • their yields are , even in this climate , very high and superior to those of the Russian selections .
in these regions that are entirely suited to cereals , two T@@ ac@@ is projects adopted the recommendations for a profitable system of milk production .
K@@ our@@ chat@@ ov , 60 km to the south @@@ -@@ @ west of Kursk • the " First of May " kol@@ kho@@ z , comprising " le@@ ached brown forest " less fertile soils ( District of Kursk , 15 km to the north of Kursk ) .
the breakdown of the crops cultivated was as follows : • PR@@ G + WC ( for gra@@ zing , pe@@ a @@@ -@@ @ o@@ at under@@ see@@ ding ) : 2@@ 95 ha • fodder sugar be@@ et : 30 ha .
planting of the new crops The sowing of PR@@ G + WC could begin in mid April and was completed by the end of April under@@ se@@ eded with field pe@@ a @@@ -@@ @ fodder o@@ ats under conditions as described above .
the 210 ha of land made available to the pilot project are situated around one of the cow sheds with a capacity to hold 200 cows .
the bare @@@ -@@ @ earth see@@ ding of 26 ha of new past@@ ure in proximity to the cow sheds was possible at the end of July just after the wheat harvest .
average milk production was 17 l / day / cow in the project against 8 l / day for the other cows .
weed control is excellent , it is done using B@@ é@@ than@@ al Progress at a low dose ( 1 l / ha ) when the we@@ eds are very young ( two true leaves ) .
right : " A@@ fil@@ a " pe@@ as : a good feed supplement to sil@@ age made of PR@@ G + WC promoting milk production in excess of 25 kg / cow / day .
filling of rum@@ en : un@@ chop@@ ped for@@ age , mainly volum@@ inous for@@ age , remains in the rum@@ en ( second stomach ) for a certain period of time , in order to be broken up , caused by fermentation and chew ­ ing .
for@@ age has a filling effect , measured by the amount of dry matter in the rum@@ en , increasing simultaneously with the amount of lig@@ ni@@ fied fi@@ b@@ res which are hard for the animal to chew .
Ing@@ esti@@ bility depends on the taste of the feed and is expressed in units of filling , men ­ tioned in the tables .
PD@@ IE : dig@@ esti@@ ble in intest@@ ine protein of micro@@ be origin , corresponding to energy of the feed , fer ­ m@@ ented in the rum@@ en ( g / kg ) .
it is also the acceptable number of animals ( expressed in Li@@ vestock Un@@ its , L@@ U ) in a me@@ adow or past@@ oral space according to the available fodder resources and the bearing capacity of the soil .
the stoc@@ king rate level can be distinguished , it is the average number of animals present per ha , spread over a period of time ( season , year , etc . ) .
the potential of the carrying capacity determines the stoc@@ king rate of a unit of area according to its fodder potential .
by gra@@ zing , use of this first growth * cycle takes place before the plant has reached 20 cm in height ( " ear at 10 cm " of the till@@ ering plateau stage or " the 2 kno@@ ts " stage ) .
the plant becomes very dig@@ esti@@ ble and is very conducive to good milk production ( 20 @@@ -@@ @ 25 lit@@ res / day at the beginning of lac@@ tation , without use of concentrates ) .
after use of the of the first growth cycle at the right moment , all the ER@@ G re @@@ -@@ @ grow@@ ths will be leaf@@ y .
the cows will gra@@ ze on these leaf@@ y re @@@ -@@ @ grow@@ ths in fields enclosed by electric fencing , under the same conditions as du@@ r ­ ing the first growth cycle .
the WC is the " engine of the grass@@ lands " without which , there would be no nitrogen for the ER@@ G which pro ­ duc@@ es little of its own .
as the ER@@ G and the WC have to be allowed to replen@@ ish their reserves before winter , gra@@ zing should not continue too late into the season .
the simultaneous sowing of shelter plants ( pe@@ as + o@@ ats ) and the future grass@@ land ( ER@@ G + WC ) took place at the end of May 1996 after resumption of cultivation with the winter pl@@ ough@@ ing .
the making of sil@@ age from the cover crop ( pe@@ as + o@@ ats ) was started at the beginning of August 1996 .

in Its first five years of operation , 1991 -@@ 1995 , T@@ ac@@ is has committed EC@@ U 2,@@ 26@@ 8 million to launch more than 2,@@ 200 projects .
T@@ AC@@ IS provides know @@@ -@@ @ how from a wide range of public and private organisations which allows experience of market economies and democracies to be combined with local knowledge and skills .
since 1991 , useful work , in a variety of different forms , has been done to assist partner countries through the T@@ ac@@ is programme .
indeed , a reliable mailing system infrastructure is one of the key elements of economic develop ­ ment for individu@@ alised mass communication .
with the expected recovery of the economy in NIS countries , a rise in imports of goods and services together with postal traffic imports is forecast .
any business needs to have a purpose : an outcome that the enterprise ensures to achieve the satisfaction of its owners and employees .
several columns carried headings describing aspects of M@@ IPO as if they had been successful , but the details were left blank .
step 3 : how to achieve the vision : the key Direc@@ tions Each of the different aspects of the vision set the agenda for achievement in a number of areas : the key Direc@@ tions .
nevertheless , In the free @@@ -@@ @ thinking environment of the workshop , managers were able to rise above their current problems and identify hard measures of success against which their performance could be judged .
these too would later be crucial for the design of the strategic plan and to help managers define their jobs in terms of purposeful organisation ­ al results .
the result was , for the first time , a rational and scientific market analysis that would enable M@@ IPO to make key decisions on the marketing mix : the Products , the Price , Place ( distribution ) , and Promotion of products .
a questionnaire was used by M@@ IPO managers to Inter@@ view their customers to build a number of attributes such as : • Per@@ cep@@ tions of service quality • Understanding of key products • Future needs .
an understanding of what customers want and need , and how these requirements will change in the future , is crucial to the sustained success of any business .
• Me@@ et with a customers / marketing staff to find out what it is they really want from the differing services • Test the list of attributes which research suggests are appropriate indicators
the customers were very satisfied with many of the products available but made a n@@ um ­ ber of suggestions for improving the service .
market development : • Move into new market segments • Use new distribution channels • Go into new geographical areas
this business plan therefore became a realistic and " living " document for management of the enterprise .
its features included : • M@@ ails volume forecasts • Market analysis • Product contribution analysis • Assessment of investment options • Pot@@ ential sources of finance • An operating plan .
in addition , a comprehensive survey of long @@@ -@@ @ term investment options was conduct ­ ed , out@@ lining the relative value of each of these .
the total quality movement has been one of the most enduring features of manage ­ ment thinking over the last decade .
after each exercise , the participants analysed what went well and what went badly , and each group was assessed by a trainer .
the full programme is given in the annex ( training course n ° 1 ) , illustr@@ ating how theory and practice lead to action .
in order to continue the development of the human resource , M@@ IPO creates a training center delivering also courses to other institutes .
the restructuring of the Post Office business aimed at achieving a greater focus on cus ­ tom@@ er satisfaction , a greater capability for speedy decision @@@ -@@ @ making , and to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the administrative sections .
the strategic logic for the restructuring of the Top Team was to focus upon the key directions of the business defined by M@@ IPO in the " Vi@@ sions , Direc@@ tions , Goals " statement .
directions 1 to 3 fall into the classic structures of many global companies , and gave authority to the creation / review of the roles of the following functions : sales , personnel and finance .
direction 5 introduced a requirement for a deeper level of market analysis , and thus added the classic function of " marketing " to that of sales .
the importance of this work was that by critically ap@@ pra@@ ising the value added by each job , the business was able to diagnose areas of waste and work that was unnecessary .
by making decisions on which activities should be paid for in priority order , the enter ­ prise has identified 20 % of administrative posts as unnecessary .
then the focus group agreed on the first prior ­ ities : • Or@@ d@@ inary export letters • Regi@@ stered import small packets .
the results of these include further improvement in mails handling , but they also released a complete floor of the building which might be used for new products or could be let out to other companies .
the management of M@@ IPO were concerned that they should not have to rely on an external software supplier in the long term .
the system also offers potential new products for the business such as track and trace and mailing list production .
most importantly , this means that Moscow International Post Office now has the cap@@ ab@@ il ­ ity to develop itself for the future .
this techno@@ l ­ ogy is flexible enough to meet the future needs of the business and thus will ensure a continuing return on investment .
in this respect , the strategy of " Vision , Direc@@ tion and Goals " gave strategic choice to the business about how it could achieve its purpose .
certainly the most imp@@ or ­ tant has been the commitment of the management of the Moscow International Post Office .
the third lesson is that short term improvements are required and they are the only way to prove the efficiency of the restructuring process and make the cultural change possible in the company to be restructured .
and this is also a lesson to be learnt : restructuring any kind of big organisation in the way of better business absolutely requires cultural change .
during this interim period , although progress had proceeded at di@@ f ­ fer@@ ent rates , in total the results achieved were at a higher than expected level , thanks to cultural changes in the staff .
this led to a major re @@@ -@@ @ plan at the end of the seventh month which further reduced the focus on the role of automation and capital investment planning .
flexibility to develop a work programme to meet the real business needs and the ability to draw on additional specialists is considered to have made a major impact on the su@@ c ­ c@@ ess of the project .
this will enable delegates to develop a pro ­ active strategy for developing people and fur@@ nish them with the knowledge , skills and conf@@ i ­ dence to design and deliver training events to meet identified training objectives .
■ New@@ ly appointed training staff who have either not yet been involved in training or who have never been given a thorough gr@@ ounding in training skills
although the course is broken down into segments the important point is for the tutor to emphasize the links between all the segments .
recently appointed managers or current managers who would benefit from being made more aware of the commercial consequences of decision @@@ -@@ @ making .
they will Identi@@ fy key customer objectives for their organisations ; what needs to be done to meet any shortfall ; and key skills and systems essential to implementing a cus ­ tom@@ er care strategy .
using this structure and ensuring people stay in their allo@@ tted group the day pro ­ g@@ resses to look at the role of every individual in the organisation .
• The organisation 's vision , direction and goals • Cas@@ c@@ ading goals into tasks • Job purpose statements • Key result areas • Tar@@ gets and standards • Writ@@ ing measurable standards • Performance reviews • The team and the individual
at the end of the course managers will have developed their own tool kit for change which will be custom@@ ised to their own needs .
the day will show how the successful execution of a framework will set a positive climate and maintain com ­ mit@@ ment to achieve desired results at individual and group level .
delegates are equipped with the knowledge and skills which enable them to shape a quality implementation plan that will be owned at all levels .

the philosophy was to build a strong and permanent relationship between the Russian wood processing industry and the most relevant European counterparts : industri@@ alists , designers , R & D centres and distributors .
the Russian timber harvesting and wood processing sectors were estimated to include over 3@@ 4,000 enterprises ( usually large in size ) spread over the entire territory of the Russian Federation .
market driving forces are relevant Output quality is important Output volume targets are no longer relevant
consequently , the aim of the project was simple : bring a real added value to the Russian wood processing industry at two levels : • restructuring assistance • industrial co @@@ -@@ @ operation .
to avoid the occurrence of rejection , rather than propose ready @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ use models the T@@ ac@@ is project experts worked in field with their Russian counterparts resolving daily problems faced by the pilot companies .
consequently , one of the main problems during the restructuring process was how to insti@@ l the concept of quality control at every step of the production process and increase the quality of the final products .
the restructuring assistance process needs to be supported by a process whereby any foreign company can provide its expertise and its support to the selected Russian com p@@ any .
some of the results have been : • increased market share • development of new products / markets • decrease of stock • new more flexible structures .
in three cases the restructuring assistance was only the first step of an industrial co operation process as presented in the following figure and paragraphs : • Sh@@ at@@ ura • Sev@@ z@@ ap@@ me@@ bel • Bolshevik .
the result of the intervention has eliminated all the logistic limiting factors and has led to the improved utilis@@ ation of the plant .
as a result , a totally new product has been created in cooperation with a European partner , using the new industri@@ alised structure as a basis ( see photo ) .
for these reasons the new " rich " Russians go and buy in shops that offer imported furniture with a much higher level of quality and design .
the European partner will participate in the Investment needed for the set ­ up of each shop with a cont@@ rib@@ u ­ tion equal to 50 % of the overall investment .
considering the actual activity volume of the individual units , the project suggested concentrating all the production of the semi @@@ -@@ @ finished products in the " N@@ eva " company .

national level The central unit of the service is called the Agricultural Training and Advisory Centre ( AT@@ AC ) and is situated within the Ministry of Agriculture and Food headquarters in the capital .
it has been guided since its inception by expatri@@ ate advisors provided by the T@@ ac@@ is project during 1995 and 1996 .
successful candidates were given an initial three @@@ -@@ @ month contract on prob@@ ation , contingent upon su@@ itability and capability , and dependent upon continued funding under T@@ ac@@ is .
this gave them the opportunity to introduce themselves to the farmers , explain what the service was attempting to do , and to gain first @@@ -@@ @ hand knowledge from farmers of their problems .
the AT@@ As has made considerable progress in the almost two years since it started .
some of this Is short @@@ -@@ @ term funding as In the case of T@@ ac@@ is .
however , It is to be hoped that the advisory service will assist in pushing agricultural productivity and profitability to a level at which farmers might be prepared to support it financially .
the initial development work carried out by T@@ ac@@ is in setting up the AT@@ As has been shown to be successful , and is addressing farmers ' needs .

some information on the project Title Semin@@ ars and workshops in management accounting Results Training of 180 university teachers of economics to teach management accounting at university level at five locations in the Russian Federation .
some information on this brochure Use The methodology proposed in the brochure includes a did@@ actic approach combining theoretical explanations over the main product cost calculation methods and which one to choose in different situations .
we can easily extend this concept to groups of products and to In@@ tangible products or services from hair@@ cuts to bank loans .
what , for example , Is the total cost of bringing a new pro@@ d ­ UC@@ T to the market or the annual cost of correcting manufacturing errors ?
final assembly , test ( mainly of electr@@ i ­ cal In@@ sul@@ ation efficiency ) and packaging was also carried out by R@@ H Ltd .
we have manufactured and sold 14@@ 3,000 ket@@ tles for US $ 39 each , but each kettle only costs us US $ 20.@@ 57 .
we need product cost to establish stock values at the beginning and end of the account ­ ing period to be able to match costs and revenues during the period .
this matching or accru@@ al concept is crucial to profit calculation because differences in stock values can lead to very different profit figures based on the same cash transactions :
in a manufacturing company finished goods are valued at the lower end of Manufac@@ tu@@ r ­ ing costs or market value .
what , on the basis of the above information , would Mr Grad@@ gr@@ ind ( assuming he is a well @@@ -@@ @ trained accountant ) say the correct gross profit figure is ?
sales in the period less cost of goods sold in the period
so far we have only been looking at the manufacturing cost of products , mainly to value stocks as part of profit calculation .
to concentrate fully on the allocation problem it assumes initially that stocks remained constant during the accounting period and that manufacturing over@@ heads are fixed .
the medium term risks of undermining the whole price structure by basing even exceptional pricing decisions on such data have risen accordingly .
with the information available it was not possible to allocate any administrative overhead to product groups .
on the information above , roughly 1,@@ 240 = 2,@@ 3@@ 17 / ( 1,@@ 8@@ 88 + 1,@@ 6@@ 39 ) χ 1,@@ 8@@ 88 if all over ­ head were allocated In a full cost system .
however , variants on the original " A " model were gradually introduced and by 1986 this basic kettle was only contributing one third of total kettle sales .
the top of the line model , for example , was " cor@@ dless " in the sense that it could be picked up from a fully det@@ achable base .
" A@@ ye " he said " that cor@@ dless kettle still stops the line quite a lot , but at least we catch the problems before they get to the customer .
what would happen to the main overhead categories , and net profit , if R@@ H stopped
there has been considerable discussion at R@@ H Ltd. about the very high costs of pro@@ du@@ c ­ ing the heating element for the coffee pot and its surrounding parts .
for technical reasons to do with the bon@@ ding of the element assembly to the ceramic body , it is more or less impossible to replace a defective element .
but this statement is crucially dependent on numbers actually sold and does not apply at all to individual sales projects , each of which must try to maxim@@ ise benefit to the company in the long term .
they all seem to point in the direction of keep ­ ing the production of such an Import@@ ant part of the product in R@@ H .
labour cost / year Number of units / year Labour cost / unit of output Adv@@ ant@@ age
costing for planning and control remuneration , The method can also be used for repetitive activities in the office , as opposed to shop floor , environment .
many companies therefore use historical standard costs , modified to reflect company cost saving goals and technical or organisational improvements .
in practice , some of the actual costs of a particular cost centre will be calculated with the help of average ( sometimes also conf@@ us@@ ingly called standard ) costs .
the product requires a single operation , and the standard cost for this operation is presented on the standard cost card as follows :
annual bud@@ geted fixed over@@ heads are US $ 1,@@ 4@@ 40,000 and are assumed to be incurred evenly throughout the year .
this is often useful because the manager responsible for how frequently it is used is often not responsible for the price that the company pays for the resource .
it shows the vari@@ ance caused by the actual sales margin being different from the stan ­ d@@ ard margin , because of deviations from standard selling price .
as direct labour hours are often under the control of someone other than the manager responsible for variable over@@ heads It is important to separate these two possible explanations .
it therefore compares actual overhead with what overhead should have been given the actual direct labour hours used .
it hand is caused by vari@@ ances in the number of direct labour hours used , which them ­ selves may result from changed volumes or from changes in the efficiency of direct labour .
standards that can , in principle , never be met produce constant " false alarms , " confuse analysis , and dem@@ o@@ tiv@@ ate managers .
absorption ( full ) costing al@@ locates full costs to cost objects , usually on the basis of direct costs or physical output measures

a couple of years ago , however , neither the economic conditions nor the profession ­ al background of some banks in NIS were able to meet these standards .
taxes for SMEs are still prohib@@ itively high , and bureau ­ cratic regulations often stifle small scale business activities ( Western European SMEs , however , complain about taxes and regulations as well ) .
as no general scientific definition of small and medium @@@ -@@ @ sized enterprises ( SM@@ E ) exists , the term " SM@@ E " Is normally used to describe companies up to a certain number of employees or a specific range of annual sales .
as Germany 's multinational corporations drastically reduced jobs , SMEs created more than one million new jobs in the last three years .
one of the most common criteria for classi@@ fying the debt financing needs of a company is to discern whether they are short @@@ -@@ @ term , medium @@@ -@@ @ term or long @@@ -@@ @ term needs .
short @@@ -@@ @ term loans help to balance the different terms between the time when current assets can be realised and be transferred into cash , and when short @@@ -@@ @ term liabilities fall due .
the source of repayment Is the completion of the business cycle , that is , when all bus@@ i ­ ness activities have , hopefully , been converted into cash .
the bank 's risk assessment will focus on the liquidity of the assets of the SM@@ E and on its management 's ability to M@@ IT@@ I ­ gate risks .
the funds for repayment should be generated by the cash flow that is derived from the output or production from the financed investment .
the financial effects of such invest ­ ments have to be taken into account when setting up the financial planning ( see page 23 , Bre@@ ak even analysis and profit sensitivity ) .
often the first contact will be at the bank 's premises , but it is advisable that the entrepreneur invite his loan officer to visit the SM@@ E 's business premises as soon as po@@ s ­ sible .
if there is a management team at the SM@@ E , the managing director and his chief financial officer should take part in the discussions with the banker .
for exam ­ PL@@ E , an entrepreneur would like to know how the bank ass@@ esses his industry branch in particular , or what ratios tell the most for his kind of business .
the entrepreneur should keep in mind that - from the bankers point of view - the interest rate has to reflect the risk related to the SM@@ E 's business .
the more valuable the collateral is , the lesser is the credit risk , and the bank has every reason to charge a lower interest rate .
analysing and deciding on the first loan to a SM@@ E that has been unknown to the bank so far , takes a lot of time and expertise .
the better the entrepreneur knows about his business and his industry sector , the easier it should be for him to provide the banker with all the necessary information .
knowing the basic principles of banking legislation makes It easier for the entrepreneur to understand why a bank must ask for certain information .
so , bank ­ ing laws regulate the g@@ earing or leverage ratio that measures the extent to which a bank 's funding is provided by third parties ( that is , deposits ) and by shareholders .
knowing which information the bank needs , and how this information is weighed by the bank , should facilitate the preparation of the entrepreneur 's loan application .
as the balance sheet is a statement that shows a firm 's assets and liabilities , the banker can see what a SM@@ E owns and what it owes to its cre@@ d ­ itors .
financial statements that have been audited by an in@@ de ­ pen@@ dent auditor will always be appreciated by a bank .
since the balance sheet is drawn up at the close of the SM@@ E 's fiscal year , it only represents a true and fair view of the fin@@ an ­ cial situation at this very day .
for the banker , the credit interview is one of the rare opportunities to gain insights into the entrepreneurs mind @@@ -@@ @ set and integrity .
when a credit analyst has to make a credit decision , the first thing he or she will have to analyse is a firm 's balance sheet .
the balance sheet analysis alone may often not be su@@ f ­ f@@ ici@@ ent to assess a SM@@ E 's cred@@ it@@ worthiness , and other factors have to be taken into con ­ si@@ der@@ ation .
these factors , like the qualification of management , the market perspectives , the industry sector analyses , etc . , may finally be considered more important than the financial figures .
the firm 's management may have sound rea ­ sons to show a particularly high or low amount of cash or bank deposits .
therefore , this figure has to be compared with the previous year 's figure and those of other com ­ pan@@ ies of the same industry sector .
if a SM@@ E sett@@ les all or most of its payments via one bank , this bank will compare the cash and bank deposits statement in the balance sheets with the average amount held in its current account .
► Fixed assets These are assets that the company wants to retain for a long period of time and which it does not intend to res@@ ell .
whenever land and buildings are needed as collateral , an independent expert 's opinion on the net real@@ is@@ able value of the real estate should be required .
► Plant and machinery The type and quantity of plant and equipment are determined by the type of goods a company produces .
there is usually no commitment on the part of the bank to advance funds for a longer period of time .
► Medium and long @@@ -@@ @ term loans The banker will wish to know the details of these loans , that is the amount , when they are due for repayment , and whether they are secured or un@@ secured .
provisions are reserves established from profits to meet future obligations like pensions .
the entrepreneur must disclose a detailed breakdown of his SM@@ E 's sales according to products , regional markets , customer groups , etc .
the enterprise 's product range should be well diversified , and the bank could ask for information on the contribution that each product group makes to the firm 's turnover .
then , exceptional ( that is non @@@ -@@ @ operating ) income and expenses have to be con ­ si@@ dered , as well as the result of the company 's financial transactions .
the entrepreneur should be aware that the cash flow ( and not sales or profit ) is one of the most important ratios when banks analyse financial statements .
a bank should know about the net real@@ is@@ able value of a corporate client 's largest fixed assets , such as buildings and machines .
after taxes have been deduc@@ ted , the final result is the net income or loss of the SM@@ E in the respective fiscal year .
as ratios vary depending on industry sector , each SM@@ E should try to find the most meaningful ratios for its business and discuss them with its banker .
the break @@@ -@@ @ even @@@ -@@ @ analysis enables the entrepreneur to calculate which level of sales is required for a certain activity to be profitable .
for instance , how would an increase of 15 % of expenses for raw materials or a 10 % decline in sales prices ( e.g. to stimulate further sales ) change the overall profitability of the company ?
the companies currently operating in the industry will try to gain market share , or to defend their " piece of the cake . "
well @@@ -@@ @ established companies may still have other advantages that are not avail ­ able to potential new rivals .
thus , it is important for a bank to know the product range of a corporate client , and each product 's proportion of total sales .
the following ratios provide both the entrepreneur and his banker with insights into the risks associated with the particular stages of the bus@@ i ­ ness cycle .
the banker is most interested in marketing issues because it is the customers of the SM@@ E who contribute to its revenues , and nobody else .
so the banker must come to a conclusion about the reasonable prospects of the SM@@ E 's products , their prices , their dis ­ tribution channels and the way they are promoted and advertised .
► Price - how are the products priced in comparison to the competitors of the SM@@ E ? - is a system of reb@@ ates or bonuses established ? - how sensitive is the market to changes in prices ?
if the b@@ or ­ row@@ er fails to repay his loan at the due date , the bank has the right to sell the collateral to make up for the loan loss .
the building , however , had been constructed in earlier times on communal land that did not care about its lots of previous owners .
the workshop building was located on a piece of real estate that was contaminated with decades of oil and gre@@ ase .
a typical credit report has to address the following items , many of which have been supplied by the entrepreneur .
from the banker 's point of view , it is most important that the margin reflects the risk that is associated with each particular credit .
there goes a saying that " banks lend umbrel@@ las in the sunshine , and when it starts rain ­ ing , they want to have their umbrel@@ las back . "
the entrepreneur of a SM@@ E will nor ­ m@@ ally be in contact with a local bank branch .
banks have developed early warning systems that give advance notice when the fin@@ an ­ cial situation of a SM@@ E deterior@@ ates .
over the life of the loan , changes in this rating provide the loan officer with a clear trend of how the borrowing SM@@ E develops - at a single glance .
the bank 's alternatives are - sell the collateral , if the collateral is valuable enough - liquid@@ ate the borrowing company / bankruptcy - continue the business as a going concern .
does the share of the company 's real product novel@@ ties ( not older than five years ) amount to more than 20 % ?
is the company able to sol@@ icit new customers abroad with its current products ?
succession arrangement Is the company able to survive without the managing directors product development skills / his personal contacts ?
is the company 's equity ratio equivalent to the usual height of that of a sound and eff@@ i ­ cient company in its industry sector ?
did the company take measures in order to make its currency risks ( more ) calcul@@ able ? yes D No D
is the company guarded against damages to its assets and losses of its earnings ( e.g. by the help of an Insurance policy covering these risks ) ?

the production of a profitable sugar be@@ et crop is demanding , requiring a high level of skill , knowledge and capital investment .
as more commercial pressure Is applied to farms , the temptation to shor@@ ten rot@@ ational breaks may arise .
in areas of low p@@ H acid soils , the place of sugar be@@ et in the rotation should dictate the application of lime to recti@@ fy any ac@@ idity problem ( see crop nutrient section ) .
• a soil un@@ comp@@ acted to full ro@@ oting depth , to allow deep ro@@ oting and free drainage .
in the author 's opinion the quality of Pl@@ ough@@ s in NIS is generally poor , and does not lend itself to good primary soil preparations , even when used with care .
all fields to be cro@@ pped with sugar be@@ et should be examined for comp@@ action in the prev@@ i ­ O@@ Us crop by digging Inspection pits and examining ro@@ oting systems , comparing areas of good and poor growth .
local varieties , bred and developed to suit local conditions , have benefits that are all too frequently ignored by those involved in be@@ et production .
samples should be representative of the whole field to produce a good average .
medium tex@@ tured soils need no more than 100 kg , with even lower rates needed by soils with high organic content ( down to 50 kg ) .
on lighter soils , the pot@@ ash levels in the soil available to plants will fall , if adequate main@@ te ­ n@@ ance levels are not applied through the rotation .
the two most likely to be a problem , and cause nutrient deficiencies , are Bor@@ on ( B ) and Man@@ gan@@ ese ( M@@ n ) .
be@@ et is particularly susceptible when grown on al@@ kal@@ ine soils above 6.5 p@@ H , but symptoms can occur on most soils .
agr@@ onom@@ ic practice can and does have a very influential effect on population , and every effort must be made to encourage young se@@ ed@@ lings to develop and reach their true potential .

whilst some of this was due to poor drill per ­ formance or lack of attention to drill settings , often the problem was the seed itself , being poorly graded and presented .
unfortunately , most NIS seeds do not reach these ideals , and often seeds presented for precision drilling are un@@ satisfactory .
usually spring temperatures will increase steadily , and it is In this environment that be@@ et establishes well .
uniform depth is as important as even spac@@ ing along the row , and care should always be taken when setting depth .

timing of this first post @@@ -@@ @ emergence spray is the key to success in controlling we@@ eds in the crop .
some species may only be at the susceptible stage for adequate control for a matter of two or three days , especially if a pre @@@ -@@ @ emergence spray has been omitted from the programme .
soil loos@@ ening cultiv@@ ations to create a soil mul@@ ch to help prevent moisture loss from cracked , drying soils can prove beneficial .
any later will damage leaves and affect yield , whilst cultivating too early will interfere with weed control by the spray programme .
trials conducted in Krasnodar in 1993 and 1994 suggest that be@@ et can be grown equal ­ ly effectively in the Kub@@ an without any inter @@@ -@@ @ row cultiv@@ ations .
there is no question that p@@ ell@@ eting or sl@@ ur@@ ry coating of Russian seeds would improve plant establishment and early plant vig@@ our .

as the attack develops , leaf chlor@@ osis occurs , and , in the case of severe attack , leaves turn yellow and die .
most other fun@@ gal root diseases ( listed below ) are not considered a problem as long as the rotation is kept as wide as possible , with a minimum 4 year break , which is usually the case throughout the NIS .
there are new resistant varieties being developed in western Europe , and although these are well advanced , it must be in the interest of NIS be@@ et production to keep the disease out of all regions .
the shortage of water in be@@ et leaf tissue restricts the entry of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , slow ­ ing the pho@@ tos@@ yn@@ thesis process and leading to a reduction of yield potential .
with a free market for sugar , farms have a greater incentive to maxim@@ ise sugar production .
every extra ton@@ ne of sugar sold is worth in excess of 300 US $ per hectare ( 1994 prices ) .
in the Kub@@ an , farms with irrigation can expect at least this level of improvement , or even higher .
investment in irrigation equipment may not be justified for the be@@ et crop alone , but , if it exists already , then its use on the be@@ et crop will be well worthwhile .
the use of a ' nurse ' crop of barley has proved the most successful , and could easily be adapted for the Kub@@ an .
if by harvesting early , this process is interrupted , then the loss of sugar yield can be very significant .
farms with adequate harvesting capacity can delay harvesting , and still clear the fields before the advent of bad weather .
the aim should always be to leave as little sal@@ eable be@@ et in the field as possible , and to always ensure that no green material is sent to the factory .
adequate supervision must ensure adjustments are made as soon and as often as necessary .
under wet harvesting conditions , the domestic machines do lack cleaning capacity , and the web type cleaner can prove inefficient .
however , in the Kub@@ an , wet harvesting con@@ di ­ tions do not occur regularly , and less than one year in ten can be considered a real pro@@ b ­ lem year .
care and attention to detail will do much to alleviate these losses , motivation and training of staff being important elements of a be@@ et growing strategy .
under current arrangements with factories , the delivery of be@@ et to factories is direct from the field or from short@@ term holding areas .
however , any be@@ et stored , even on a temporary basis , will lose both root weight and sugar content if not treated with care .
ideally , farms should only harvest enough be@@ et during this early period to keep factories running .

in a market economy , production is demand @@@ -@@ @ driven , i.e. driven by the consumer , or ¡ n other words : " you have to produce what the consumer asks for ! . "
before getting the actual project work underway , it is necessary to have answered a lot of questions , such as : what products ? what organis@@ a ­ tion ? what prices ?
► In the case of Tomsk , the sector analysis had been carried out during the first phase of the T@@ ac@@ is project as this was one of the tasks assigned to the contractor .
approximately 80 % of the main raw material , flour , was supplied by the regional State @@@ -@@ @ owned flour mill .
this feature had to be taken into account as a small bakery would face these problems more acutely owing to its size .
this resulted in lower demand : daily production was 120 tons in 1989 but only 85 tons in 1992 .
on the one hand , Tomsk was a fairly homogeneous city in terms of population , con ­ su@@ mption pattern and ( declining ) purchasing power .
for retailers , the criteria are the following • quality of the service • fresh@@ ness of the product • regularity of offer • prices • hygiene of the shop .
this meant that the private bakery would address a demand already being met by the Industrial bakery , at least for traditional products . • The industrial bakery was not in a position to rapidly improve the fresh@@ ness of its products .
once all the analyses have been carried out , one should have enough Information to an ­ sw@@ er the question : " is there a real chance for my ' business I@@ dea ' ? . "
furthermore , at that time , there was no prospect of short @@@ -@@ @ term improvement on this issue : terms of payment were becoming more and more complex , and even State organisations ex@@ -
moreover , it was planned to have German master b@@ akers carry out a training programme in Tomsk , within the framework of the T@@ ac@@ is project .
selecting the location of a retail shop Is of the utmost importance as It conditions the kind of customer .
the City administration was only given a few indications : the team wanted to set up the shop in a residential area , and , If possible , not next to a competitor .
most customers are keen on novelty , and , If they are not " captive " because of lack of competition , they may easily change their purch@@ as ­ ing habits .
therefore , the target was clearly the just @@@ -@@ @ above average Tomsk household on a regular basis , with average households as casual customers .
at this stage , one should have a clear I@@ dea of the products to be offered and of the customers ' profile .
before making any decision on the equipment to be purchased and the building to be purchased or rented , It is necessary to plan the output .
the decision concerning the output results from • the product @@@ -@@ @ mix • the baking time for each product • the capacity of the oven ( s ) that can be afforded with the available budget .
local infrastructure requirements : these are all the facilities needed to manufacture the products and to ensure easy access to the shop . the most important are the following :
• • • access to the area ( public transport ) water and power supply , sewage telecommunications .
the size of the oven was defined according to the budget constraint of the T@@ ac@@ is project and the financial involvement of the future shareholders of the bakery .
while repairs were being carried out and the equipment and furniture were being in ­ stalled , particular attention was given to some basic aspects .
some of them are pro ­ por@@ tional to the level of activities of the budget and others are fixed , i.e. do not depend on the level of activity .
for a bakery : flour , sugar , butter , mar@@ gar@@ ine , ...
although efforts can be made to identify the fixed and variable parts , it is best is to consider them as fixed costs , particularly when they are not high costs .
in the financial calculations , they correspond to the direct costs .
it Is particularly Import@@ ant to correctly plan the staff that will be needed to ensure efficient operation of the business .
when a business is small , it is of the utmost importance to cater for the versati@@ lity of the staff : too specialised functions will lead to over @@@ -@@ @ staff@@ ing .
► Pot@@ ential customers were asked the time at which they were more likely to go to the bakery : the answer was broadly 50 % in the morning and 50 % in the afternoon .
the production plan must be detailed , specifying the time the products should be avail ­ able for sale .
given that one of the critical success factors of any bakery Is the fresh@@ ness of the product , it is important to have a constant flow of fresh products .
to avoid having too many people In the shop at the beginning , two guards were posted at the door to regulate the flow of customers .
now that the production system and the investments have been defined , the question of the legal status of the business has to be addressed .
• Sha@@ res were paid for by individuals according to a mixed scheme . - Half their share was said to correspond to five @@@ -@@ @ year operation earnings for each shareholder .
there is no automatic relationship between the profitability of a business and its ability to generate cash to pay for its expenses .
when a piece of equipment is purchased , it can be considered as a production cost throughout its life .
in Russia for example , it is linear depreciation , i.e. the cost of the investment is divided by the number of years in the equipment 's life duration .
• Staff So as to develop motivation and identification with the shop , it was decided that staff remuneration would comprise a fixed salary plus a bonus , the bonus being a function of turnover .
► In 1992 , bank credits were almost Im@@ possible to get , and It was even more difficult to get a loan In order to set up a business .
as far as the pur ­ chase of raw materials is concerned , given the arrangement with the mill , It does not af ­ f@@ ect the cash situation of the bakery .
he is in charge of the business , and is assisted by two production supervisors and an accountant .
whilst at the time of the creation each director had 15 % of the shares , the general manager now has 30 % .
bakery output has fallen from 1.2 tonnes per day In 1992 to 1.0 ton@@ ne per day at present for the first term of 1995 .
owing to the vigilance of the shareholders , the quality of the Nik@@ es bakery products has always remained beyond repro@@ ach .
the strategy of reducing the quality of the products so as to offer them at a price similar to those of competitors would hardly have been fruitful .
the mill Manager 's assessment of the situation is straightforward : " the demand for flour - by bak@@ eries - has been stable for the last three years .. "
the fall in demand observed by many bak@@ eries is in fact a loss of market share : the lost demand is being supplied by new bak@@ eries .
the mill now belongs to its workers ( over 700 shareholders ) and its legal status Is that of a joint stock company .
• The industrial bak@@ eries that were part of Tom@@ sk@@ h@@ le@@ b@@ prom have become Independent and been transformed In@@ to joint stock companies . these bak@@ eries are now owned by their workers .
the management team has remained and a new , entirely State @@@ -@@ @ owned company , Tom@@ sk@@ h@@ le@@ b , has been set up .
as far as pro ­ duction costs are concerned , because of economies of scale , they should be compet@@ i ­ tive , provided they are correctly managed .
some of the bak@@ eries have already started to Im@@ prove the quality of their bread ( they have abandoned some automated procedures in favour of manual ones ) and are expanding their product range .
to prevent further problems of this type , the regional administration is about to issue some basic In@@ struc@@ tions all bak@@ eries would have to comply with .
however , it must be emphasi@@ sed that the creation of all the other bak@@ eries , over 120 , has been achieved without any kind of foreign assistance : everything has been ensured by local resources , skills and entrepreneurship .

certain collective farms not possessing the skills to confront the difficult economic situ@@ a ­ tion can be lik@@ ened to drifting boats .
today , the following principle is generally accepted : restructuring must allow each ind@@ i ­ vi@@ dual to feel responsible for his work and benefit from the fruits of his labour .
as it has already been stated , certain collective farms have taken initiatives in an effort to improve their performances .
finally , certain people believe that the performance of the collective farms can be improved by Intro@@ duc@@ ing management techniques .
in order to be effective , a restructuring plan must hing@@ e on three series of actions or pro ­ c@@ ed@@ ures .
few members of the colle@@ c ­ tive farms will come of their own accord to seek this Information , not normally having had the opportunity of using such information to influence a decision .
this includes for example , the State administration and the banks which should give all possible support , particularly during the first experiments in restructuring .
the questionnaire used in the survey must be short as difficulties ( in terms of time and the exac@@ tness of replies ) can be encountered in long questionnaires .
the cost of the cooperative 's advisory services are included in its general over@@ heads and , consequently , this does not appear as a paying service for the producer .
but It is important for a start not to create a complex structure involved in two many services .
as far as the choice of the organisation 's legal status is concerned , chosen from among those allowed by the legislation , this differs from country to country .
a limited profit margin can be envisaged , even if this is only to constitute a reserve .
a 1991 T@@ ac@@ is project assisted a group of private farmers in the Ri@@ az@@ an Oblast .
the T@@ ac@@ is project financed the purchase of equipment ( tractors , Pl@@ ough@@ s , harvesting equipment ) .
another characteristic of the market economy Is the element of risk . restructuring in@@ te ­ gr@@ ates this new element .
risk stimulates performance and it is the absence of individual risk which pro ­ vo@@ kes the dem@@ o@@ tiv@@ ation and ir@@ responsibility .
they must be given the where@@ with@@ al to constitute the group that they want , to develop the activity they wish to develop and therefore the means to explain and convince .
the farm workers have their shares In the holding company which results will be the addition of the results of the various companies .
but they would not be interested in bearing the risk of a much bigger enterprise , involved in activities not familiar to the potential investor .

the economic transition has caused wages to become greatly devalu@@ ed and much of the population struggles to cover basic living expenses .
this creates a situation where distribution companies have critical c@@ ash@@ flow difficulties and are unable to fund even urgent maintenance of the system .
the Government recognised the magnitude of the non @@@ -@@ @ payment situation in the residential sector and in 1995 a number of actions to curb non @@@ -@@ @ payment and theft were implemented by ministerial decree .
since the energy crisis , electricity supply has been highly unreliable and individuals have become accustomed to a culture of non @@@ -@@ @ payment .
real incomes were collapsing , the economy was facing hyper @@@ -@@ @ inflation and individuals became accustomed to not having to pay for their erratic electricity services .
this high level of tam@@ pering with the system is possible due to an inability to enforce penal ­ ties and because of the faulty condition of the distribution network itself .
should the EC@@ O not meet its payment obligations ( taking into account specific contractual issues ) , the distributor can cut off the electricity supply to the whole of the EC@@ O region .
consumption for communal services such as the lift , water pump and st@@ air and external lighting are ap@@ por@@ tioned evenly across consumers in the respective entr@@ ances or buildings .
in most cases this led to a more serious appreciation of the need to pay bills and on a timely basis .
an additional benefit is the generation of statistics on the real ability of the population to pay for essential services .
collective purchasing enables the EC@@ O to negotiate a favourable electricity price and a more secure supply .
• for maintenance - to ensure that necessary repairs and maintenance are managed locally and promptly carried out • salaries of EC@@ O staff and administration costs .
the non @@@ -@@ @ profit character of the EC@@ O means that expenditure is tightly controlled on the three components listed above and that all revenue is used for the direct benefit of its members .
the work also served a highly important non technical purpose in raising the profile of the EC@@ O and convincing residents of its ability and commitment to make real improvements to energy services on their behalf .
non @@@ -@@ @ payment was rarely pen@@ alised and neither were cut @@@ -@@ @ offs imposed , thereby creating little incentive for households to pay their electricity bills .
in a few instances supplies were temporarily cut off to building entr@@ ances to force non @@@ -@@ @ pay@@ ers to pay their arrears and on @@@ -@@ @ going monthly commit@@ ment@@ s. mit@@ ments .
notices were posted on building entr@@ ances displaying their outstanding electricity debt and those that continued to avoid payment were cut off .
the pilot projects demonstrated that the majority of consumers are willing to pay for a reliable and secure energy supply , and that non @@@ -@@ @ payment can be reduced to manageable and acceptable levels .
the main topics addressed were : • the overall energy situation • the role of the newly formed EC@@ O • the benefits and obligations for the individual house@@ holders .
the Government has created separate generation and distribution companies that ultimately will be financially independent and responsible for their individual operations .
high levels of non @@@ -@@ @ payment have led to a critical and unsustainable situation , and an urgent need for reform of the energy sector .
restructuring the energy system has involved the creation of separate generation and distribution companies -@@ only power transmission has been retained under state control .
groups of neighbouring EC@@ Os may choose to merge to benefit from economies of scale and , ultimately , commercially based , public cooperative utilities may emerge .
use of vou@@ chers would help in the transfer of budget to the energy company and a reward system that shared the value of energy savings between the Government and the organisation would encourage greater energy efficiency .

some information on this brochure Use To save energy and reduce production costs by implementing no cost and low cost energy saving measures and energy management techniques .
seven iron and steel works were audited in Ukraine and nine in the Moscow , St Petersburg and Urals regions of Russia .
the measures can be classified into three distinct groups requiring different levels of investment : no cost , low cost and long @@@ -@@ @ term investment .
overall , the study concluded that possible savings in Ukraine were approximately 200@@ ,@@ 000@@ T@@ J / year representing 25 % of the present total consumption of the seven plants audited .
generally , the overall efficiencies of the Russian plants are a little higher than those in Ukraine .
the " simple pay@@ back " for a project is an indication of the number of years required for the cumulative annual savings to pay back the initial investment .
these projects do not require investment and show immediate benefits . • Low cost - low investment cost or simple pay@@ back less than one year .
a primary task Is to consider the following question : " how do you organise to manage energy in a large and complicated industry like the steel industry ? . "
this section of the guide Is intended to give an insight into those aspects of the steel making process In which energy savings can be achieved .
one site screens the incoming sin@@ ter and coke and this burden preparation leads to increased efficiency and less energy released in the top gas .
blo@@ oming and s@@ lab@@ bing mill and so@@ aking pits - used to produce and re@@ heat ing@@ ots for the rolling mill train . in the newest mills , efficient continuous casting techniques are employed .
the very large differences observed for steel making reflects the continued use of open hear@@ th furn@@ aces in Ukraine and Russia .
this poor control of air / fuel ratio leads to inefficiency as a high proportion of the heat Is lost In the exhaust gases .
better quality re@@ frac@@ tories in re@@ heating furn@@ aces - the quality of the re@@ frac@@ tory currently used imposes constraints on the operation temperature .
this leads to excess air entr@@ ain@@ ment , uneven heating and reduced insulation property , each of which has a detrimental effect on efficiency .
savings are made through behavi@@ our@@ al change , an awareness of energy w@@ ast@@ age and a commitment to operating and maintain ing plant in an efficient manner .
implement initial no cost and low cost measures - a programme to implement the first projects is developed with full support and participation of managers .
from all this information a picture can be built up of where and how energy is used and who has responsibility for it .
awareness of energy w@@ ast@@ age and good house ­ keeping can be rel@@ ayed through short presentations given by management to large groups of employees , complemented by poster campaigns or a newsletter .
an effective energy information system is required to provide the optimum level of energy and , where appropriate , cost information to each level of the organisation .
a structured and sustained approach will yield the best long @@@ -@@ @ term performance .

in future , sites may change to stand @@@ -@@ @ alone heat generation with direct gas , oil or coal firing .
although industry is the largest energy user , doubts about its future should not deter progress in other sectors .
an overview of major characteristics of energy supply In Tver is shown in Table 4 ( figures in brackets indicate the German average ) .
the interconnected network is supplied by three combined heat and power ( C@@ HP ) sta ­ tions and four boiler plants , quoted in Table 5 .
80 % of the fuel input is covered by nat@@ ur ­ al gas but almost every generation facility has a back @@@ -@@ @ up fuel source , as security of supply is essential in the harsh climate .
for the district heating network , industri@@ ally pre@@ fabricated composite plastic jacket pipes for direct underground installation are recommended for use on new network sections and for replacement of worn @@@ -@@ @ out sections subject to corrosion .
considering reserve and E@@ mer ­ gency issues , the peat ­ firing facilities should continue to be operated and can be renewed as necessary .
two strategies , a TR@@ EN@@ D scenario and an EF@@ F@@ IC@@ I@@ EN@@ C@@ Y scenario ( respectively excluding and Inclu@@ ding specific attempts towards more energy efficiency ) , were dev@@ el ­ O@@ PE@@ D up to 2010 as the target date .

since 1991 , useful work , In a variety of different forms , has been done to assist partner countries through the T@@ ac@@ is programme .
replication of these results Is possible , provided readers make an effort to adapt the contents to their local environment .
the principles of the market have already been adopted by a number of cities in Russia , and because of its low cost aspect , local City funding is generally sufficient .
although this brochure deals with the specific case of a T@@ ac@@ is model , the major part of the methodology can be used for the creation of similar wholesale schemes .
cities that have already copied the model in some way , or who are currently pursuing developments based on the model 's design are increasing In number .
having opened in July 1995 , the Samara wholesale market now provides pit@@ ches for 60 wholesale companies .
pitch size ranges from 18 - 120 m2 ( however , early results suggest that maximum pitch size should not exceed 70 m2 ) .
the market has recently compiled Its management accounts for the trading year 1994 / 95 , and these show an operating profit .
delegates from other cities continually visit the market , and some have decided to implement the market model In whole or In part .
as a result of the City authorities ' increased interest in the wholesale idea , the project 's activities were expanded to encompass the development of a low cost pilot wholesale market .
when improving a City 's food supply mechanism , it Is important to appreciate the current and likely future needs of the food sector , and those of the community .
building a wholesale market alone will not automatically improve the supply chain , unless it forms part of an overall food improvement package .
when setting up any new business , It Is necessary to consider the needs of potential customers , particularly those who will be providing the majority of its income .
it is important to note that the role of the municipality as an effective facilitator of whole sale trade was not automatically accepted by the wholesale community .
for this reason , it is important to choose those product categories which are in high demand in order to attract sufficient interest from buyers in the early days .
one green field site [ virgin land without services such as water and electricity ] was considered , along with premises that were vacant , such as the City 's former municipal food bases .
it was assumed that buyers would be prepared to travel up to 1 / 2 hour to reach the market and that good road communications would play a vital part in attracting potential customers .
by publicly addressing the needs of both suppliers and buyers , there was little objection to the new market 's introduction .
the product range of the model continues to expand as a result of encouragement from the market management , and due to the initiative of participating wholes@@ al@@ ers .
local transport companies have to develop the necessary skills to ensure that goods can be moved quickly , economically , safely and to the clients specifications .
in the case of the model , wholes@@ al@@ ers chose to display prices and products on shel@@ ving close to the trading pitch entrance , so that buyers could assess what was on offer .
photo@@ copies of such documentation are acceptable and whole sal@@ ers trading at the market need sufficient supplies of such copies to Issu@@ e to those who purchase goods at the market .
the laboratory also offers services to those outside the market who wish to obtain a health quality certificate and stamp for car@@ c@@ asses that will then be sold from other locations in the region .
this gesture was to encourage participation of the wholesale trade in the early stages and to compensate for a low customer flow for the first four weeks of the market 's life .
to ensure that an efficient flow of goods is achieved and that safety is maintained in the market , it is important to separate the action of re @@@ -@@ @ stoc@@ king pit@@ ches from the selling activity .
the example below ( Figure 5 ) has proved to be most effective at keeping order in the market and ensures that the risk of personal injury is minim@@ ised .
the Trader will lose his trading space If he breaks this rule , the money he paid for the leasing will not be returned .
at certain stages of the market 's development , up to 70 % of participating wholes@@ al@@ ers were newly @@@ -@@ @ formed businesses using the market opportunity to secure a footh@@ old on the first run@@ g of an entrepreneurial ladder .
however , difficulties can arise with the appointment of the market management , as they will find it difficult to balance the needs of investors with those of the municipality representing the needs of the community as a whole .
the Market Director is a major contribu@@ tory factor to the potential success of the market and selection of the best possible candidate should be given very careful consideration .
once the market had become established , an informal trade association was formed on the initiative of the resident wholes@@ al@@ ers .
if a market is to be affordable through local City funding , it is important to consider the speed at which money can be released for the necessary refurb@@ ishment programme .
without risk , there would be no opportunity to make trading margins or provide services or product to those in the food trade .
the key to long term survival is the market 's ability to consistently provide a valued service to the food trade .
the following table shows typical transactions at the market and gives an indication of the sales vo@@ l ­ ume sold to commercial and non ­ commercial buyers .
in particular , the addition of the meat and dairy sections has served to stimulate wider attendance and has conferred added interest to the market .
in order for the market to increase the ton@@ nage of fresh produce handled , plans are in place to develop nearby refriger@@ ated warehouses - just 200 m from the existing market building .
with the increase in wholes@@ aler numbers , healthy competition in the form of better pricing , service and quality of goods has been ensured .
wholesale companies determine their own quality standards and adjust them according to the su@@ c ­ c@@ ess of their sales and marketing policies .
without the continued support from colleagues in the Tog@@ li@@ atti City administration , the market as we see it today would not have been possible .
the venture is financially self@@ supporting and has proved to be a cost effective solution for those cities wishing to pursue wholesale market development at an affordable cost .
those who visit the market comment on its bright appearance and on the way operators display self @@@ -@@ @ discipline when handling goods .
for a market to operate efficiently it needs to attain a level of financial self sufficiency , commonly referred to as critical mass .
in the case of the market model , the break @@@ -@@ @ even point for the market to cover its costs was approximately 35 wholes@@ al@@ ers .
these who have already copied the market in some way have found the Tog@@ li@@ atti costs to be a good guide , especially at the stage of securing municipal funds and putting the building work out to tender .
it is for the leaders of subsequent market schemes to decide for them selves the driving forces in their own market , and to ensure that the people around them share in that vision .
two W@@ FM categories have been identified : • major district / regional markets to serve mostly Moscow and its region .
Moscow government will own a minimum 15 % of the joint stock company intended to finance general W@@ FM network research and invest in setting up specific W@@ F@@ Ms .
the Tog@@ li@@ atti model has proved to be affordable and sustainable through local City funding , and is compatible with the immediate trading pressures found in the local economy .

their impact on the transport sector is already highly visible , although the change process is far from com ­ pl@@ ete .
although the actual numbers of vehicles in NIS cities are relatively small in comp@@ ar ­ Is@@ on to Western Europe , there is little room for complacency . this is due to several reasons :
in fact , prior to the 1990s , individual mobility and particularly the number of person ­ al vehicles were limited .
with the introduction of liber@@ alisation , the rates of individual motor@@ isation have soared , -@@ despite the difficult economic situation .
fuel savings can be made as a result of using diesel rather than petrol eng@@ ined vehicles , par@@ tic@@ u ­ lar@@ ly in urban driving conditions .
bus operators tended to give a bonus of up to 40 % of the market value of the fuel , which is equivalent to 70 % of the fuel cost paid by bus de@@ pots .
if penalties are to continue , norms should be specific to individual vehicles and take account of their conditions .
fuel @@@ -@@ @ related faults , engine faults , and In@@ correct idle speed settings are the most common faults found in vehicle inspection programmes .
corrective maintenance is the repair of unforeseen break@@ downs in workshops . this strategy is applied to low risk or random failures .
preventive maintenance involves the development of maintenance schedules to be carried out at fixed intervals of time or distance travelled .
Minsk and Boris@@ ov bus and freight de@@ pots ' maintenance systems could be convert ­ ed to ο@@ η ­ condition maintenance fairly readily .
oil anal@@ y ­ S@@ IS provides information on the condition of the oil and can indicate the optimum time to change it .
in some cases this might be in the form of drivers stealing any unused fuel at the end of their shift to sell or to use in private vehicles .
the structure of state owned trans ­ port companies in some NIS countries is such that the benefits of energy savings are not seen directly by the company saving the fuel .
this covers traction power as well as lighting , ventilation , drainage , escal@@ ators , maintenance de@@ pots and administrative services .
road taxes and fuel prices are two powerful ways of slowing down the increase in pr@@ i ­ v@@ ate car ownership and use , but again these need to be enforced to be effective .
the aim of fuel management in transport is to achieve the maximum effective use of each unit of fuel bought .
• An electrical pre@@ heating system should be considered for all buses and freight ve@@ hi ­ cles .
traffic Meas@@ ure Recommend@@ ations o Current parking regulations should be strictly enforced , and tougher measures should be introduced in city centres and at critical points in the road network to aid traffic flows .
in fact , there is a monitoring of fuel consumption within each fleet , but it is based on theoretical data which do not allow actual fuel consumption and supply to be monitored per vehicle .
St Petersburg and the Leningrad region are a focal point in the transport network of the Russian Federation .
to let the system fall into decline would simply serve to increase overall energy consumption and enc@@ our ­ age the use of the private car , leading to increasing cong@@ estion and atmospheric poll@@ u ­ tion .
a study should therefore be undertaken to assess the feasibility of introducing designated truck routes through the city and their potential benefit in terms of both reduced cong@@ estion and fuel savings .
the largest savings would , however , be achieved through the replacement of existing trains with new , lighter rolling stock with regener@@ ative br@@ aking .
when this study is complete , a long term plan should be prepared for capital invest ­ ment in the metro system to improve the energy efficiency of the fixed equipment and the rolling stock .
► The lack of adequate and accessible data about the city will be a serious impedi@@ ment to both implementing energy saving measures in the transport sector and monitoring their effectiveness .
the data should be expanded over time in order for changes to be monitored and comparisons made with other transport systems and other cities .
as can be seen from the list of recommendations above , many measures require investment , but there are effective measures that can be implemented that have very little cost associated with them .

seminars and training on the preparation of business plans , protection of intellectual property rights , n@@ é@@ go@@ ci@@ ation of commercial agreements , resolution of disputes were part of the developed subjects .
first , it explains , step by step , how to conduct a due diligence process and provides practical adv@@ ices on what to be aware of in order to limit the risk of conflict between the partners .
in the West , such conflicts are often avoided with the use of prior Investig@@ ation work and partner evaluation before significant relationships are entered into .
if no compromise or agreement can be reached between the partners , then the claims process will be the final step in resolving business disputes between the companies .
this section ¡ s designed to provide information on the due diligence process . it is not a comprehensive manual on conducting due diligence investigations .
nevertheless , the ideas and topics presented should give both NIS and foreign companies a basis for thinking about how to prepare for and design due diligence proceedings in the NIS cou@@ n ­ tries .
such a simple distinction as this often becomes a problem if each company does not commun@@ i ­ C@@ ate its own In@@ ten@@ tions clearly or does not try to find out what the other company 's in@@ ten ­ tions are .
a St. Petersburg company entered In@@ to a joint venture with a British company to buy metals in Russia and export them to the West .
some of the things that can be lost , if a business deal turns sour , are obvious .
loss of money is fairly easy to quanti@@ fy and , if the sum is modest and the business fundamentally sound , the company will sur ­ Vi@@ ve the experience .
this may lead to a fall in the value of a company 's shares as potential investors lose con ­ fi@@ dence in a company 's ability to successfully carry out future ventures .
it may also serve to focus att@@ en ­ tion on current problems at the target company , which may be able to be resolved with the assistance of the potential investor .
in particular , the NIS com ­ p@@ any will have to show that it was reasonable to trust the foreign company by allowing it to perform its payment obligation after the NIS company had delivered goods .
for example , ¡ f a company 's business involves manufacturing from raw materials and then selling its production , the company will have contracts with suppliers of raw materials and also with wholesale customers .
this protects the share ­ holders from liability and / or loss in the event of management error or deliberate mismanagement .
again , this is because the lender wants to ensure that the financial state of the tar ­ get company does not deteriorate rapidly after the target company has the lender 's money .
these regulations may also require the performance of due dil@@ i ­ gence procedures ¡ f an Investment fund is to be a direct or indirect party to the transaction .
the major subject areas that may be covered in a comprehensive second level due dil@@ i ­ gence exercise are outlined below .
much of second stage due diligence can and will be carried out by firms hired outside to conduct the investigation and acting on behalf of the investigating company .
carrying out due diligence entails much more than simply instruc@@ ting pro ­ f@@ ession@@ als , agreeing to their fees and waiting for their report .
depending on the level of due diligence , the target com ­ p@@ any can expect to be visited for any length of time from days to weeks .
depending on the specific needs and Inter@@ ests of the investigating company , the amount of information requested and the form ¡ n which is to be presented will vary .
this may consist of registered rights ( such as patents , copyright , design rights , and trademarks ) or un@@ registered " know @@@ -@@ @ how . "
the results of marketing research are the basis for forecasts and projections used to support investment decisions .
the Investig@@ ating company will need to find out all ¡ t can about possible future liabilities that may be imposed on the target company .
often the investigating company will want to carry out a full environmental audit .
thus , a target company should not be sur@@ - * prised if lenders , as well as those seeking to buy the target company , take this matter very seriously .
guarantees are really contracts which come into effect from the moment of their signing but will not be enforced unless the party whose obligations are being guaranteed defaults on those obligations .
similarly , an analysis of raw material and component stocks will demon ­ str@@ ate the success with which the target company has matched purchasing to pro ­ duction requirements .
any company wishing to work with another , especially ¡ n the context of seeking investment , must be prepared for the due diligence process - either as the target company or the investigating comp@@ a ­ ny .
what is most important is that each case requires its own planning for due dil@@ i ­ gence ; no two relationships , no two companies , are precisely the same .
this chapter is In@@ tended to be of practical use to NIS companies faced with the prospect of having to solve a dispute that has arisen with a partner company .
although litigation and arbitration have many common features , the precise rules that one must follow when pursuing a claim vary not just from system to system but from country to country .
this must be avoided . it is un@@ wise to let disputes form around personalities or hurt feel ­ ings - one should fight only when valuable economic Inter@@ ests are at stake .
however , once again , a reputable Western firm will not be offended if a NIS company carries out routine checks on its organisation and asks ( say ) for bank or trade references .
you must consider how you will enforce any legal judgement you might obtain before you enter into any binding commitments with a business partner .
it ¡ s probably fair to say that most breaches of obligations and non @@@ -@@ @ payment of small debts are dealt with by the agg@@ ri@@ eved company simply " writing off " the matter to experience .
debt collection firms will charge a " success fee , " perhaps as much as 40 ­ 50 % of the debt .
as has already been mentioned , it is not enough simply to specify that the parties wish to have any disputes settled by arbitration . they must specify which organisation will con ­ duct the arbitration .
if the foreign company loses the action the money will be used to pay the costs of the winning def@@ en ­ d@@ ant .
the most commonly used ¡ s " legal privilege " : where the document ( or part of it ) is one written by lawyers to the company for the purpose of giving advice to its client .
NIS companies may face four different scenari@@ i when they come to try to enforce judge ­ ments ( or are up against foreign countries trying to enforce jud@@ gements against them ) . these are as follows :
again , this is a purely domestic Issu@@ e and the process will depend on the law and pro@@ ce ­ d@@ ure of the country ¡ n which you are su@@ ing .
as NIS countries enters the world market , more and more NIS companies are going to be involved in partnerships and cooperation operations with companies in other cou@@ n ­ tries .

as a matter of example , the follow ­ ing table gives generic marketing strategies generally chosen in different situation .
sel@@ ec@@ tivity Identi@@ fy growth segments and special@@ ise Inv@@ est sel@@ ectively where profitability is good and risk low φ c
if the focus is on a limited number of customers for a limited number of products , a small market share could mean high profits .
any Incre@@ ase in the market share could come from expansion at the expense of compet@@ i ­ tors or from expansion of the market volume .
if it does not fulfil the expectations of the customer , he or she will not purchase it again .
furthermore , not only does the basic product need to fulfil the customers ' expectations , but additional features and services are also expected ( extras that add to the direct value of the product ) .
setting the price has to be done after a careful analysis , taking customers ' perceptions , competitors ' prices and production costs into account .
a lower price , on the other hand , would not make sense either , since buyers are willing to pay the market price .
for a wide variety of products that , unlike raw materials , are distingu@@ ishable , there can be many reasons to ask a price that is different to the market price .
sales promotions may include trade fairs where buyer and seller can meet at their mutual convenience .
these objectives have to be kept In mind when deciding on the size and structure of the sales force .
for example , it is difficult to im@@ ag ­ INE a company selling chew@@ ing gum in special stores or through travelling sales@@ men .
if the actions defined turn out not to be efficient , alternatives must be worked out in order to reach the objectives .
product management , on the other hand , has the disadvantage that similar tasks have to be fulfilled by each of the company 's product management units .
a business process ¡ s a collection of activities within the company , aimed at creating value for the customer on the market place .
as a result of this new information the dis@@ orientation of the Western European participants grew - leading to intensified formal and informal discussion .
this pro ­ Gram@@ me is to be implemented in close co@@ ope ­ ration and coordination with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe .
we , here in this strange East / West interface of Berlin and Pot@@ s@@ dam , have noticed that there are some people who even feel threatened by the ending of the separation between East and West .
it is the aim of this conference to high ­ light the possibilities for , and limits to , East ­ West exchange programmes and to promote encounters and cooperation among young people of all European cou@@ n ­ tries .
but these exchange programmes are not just about friendly get ­ toge@@ thers of young PE@@ O ­ PL@@ E from different countries .
I especially thank the Task Force Human Resources , Education , Tra@@ i ­ ning and Youth of Commission of the Europe ­ an Commun@@ ities for the generous support it is giving to this conference .
during the past 40 years , a quite elaborate and time ­ tested system of youth aid has been developed , which is embedded in an efficient social and legal system .
the government of the Federal Republic of Germany , under the leadership of Helmut Kohl , is making great efforts to assist our Eastern neighbours in this difficult period .
the German government for its own part has created a special programme for ' Advis@@ ing on the Development of dem@@ o@@ c ­ r@@ acy and Social Market Economy in the States of Central and Eastern Europe and in the New Independent States ' .
the total su@@ p ­ port from Germany amounts to approximately 55 % of all aid provided by Western countries .
this period in time is offering us the great and unprecedented opportunity of bringing all of Europe together in peace and freedom .
also , as a community of Western states we are charged with strengthening , within the framework of the EC and the Council of Euro pe , our bilateral as well as multilateral cooperation with our Central and Eastern European neighbours .
words of greeting by Professor Antonio Rub@@ er@@ ti , Member of the Commission of the European commun@@ i ­ ties , responsible for Research , Human Resources , Education , Training and Youth .
on 1 January 1993 , with the completion of the Single Market , new economic as well as political realities have been established in the Euro pe@@ an Community .
the Council of Europe , the European Parliament and the EC Commission have created the basis for this .
common concerns of the original initi@@ ators ( political deci@@ sion@@ makers in cooperation with strong youth associations ) , were , among others , the following :
the Land of Brandenburg must accomplish a total reconstruction of state and county administrations , of the legal system , and carry out a comprehensive regional reform .
thanks to their common stable foundation , these programmes can respond sensi@@ tively to the changing needs of young people involved in economic crises and radical global change .
• to define the role of youth exchange within the framework of national youth policy ; • to describe the minimum conditions for su@@ c cess@@ ful exchange programmes .
historical and cultural context , aims , methods of action and perspectives by Dr. Alexand@@ ros T@@ sol@@ ak@@ is Task Force Human Resources , Education , Training and Youth of the Commission of the European Commun@@ ities , Head of the Youth Department
the European Community is part of the " European home " or , to put it in broader terms , of " a new European architecture . "
there has been criticism that decisions taken at the EC level lack transparency .
that 's why the EC is so serious about its cooperation with and su@@ p ­ port for the developing world , as exemplified in the collaboration with the AC@@ P. states fol@@ lo ­ wing the Lom@@ é Convention .
there is a Commission , a European Par@@ lia ­ ment , an Economic and Social Committee and a Council of Ministers .
so it is definitely wrong to assume that decisions are taken in Brussels by a handful of anonymous officials .
countries acc@@ eding to the EC are required to adopt in full the acqu@@ is commun@@ aut@@ aire , the instrument already agreed in legally binding form by the existing member states .
when a country joins the EC , it must accept the " aqu@@ is commun@@ aut@@ aire " in full .
6.2 T@@ AC@@ IS ( Technical Assistance for the Commonwealth of Independent States ... and Georgia ) A programme to support economic reforms in regions which occupy a key position in the reform process .
at this stage of rapid change , the Community is seeking step by step , but no less determin@@ edly , the road to political union .
the development of European youth encounter programmes by Alexand@@ ros T@@ sol@@ ak@@ is , Task Force Human Resources , Education , Training and Youth of the Commission of the European Commun@@ ities , Head of the Youth Department
• The Community , which started life as a purely economic organization , has taken some time to turn its attention to the concept of human resources .
finally , it was only in 1985 that the European Council adopted the People 's Europe conclusions recomm@@ ending that youth exchanges within the community be promoted and a fully ­ fledged network of exchanges within and between the Member States set up .
• At the end of 1991 , the European Parliament gave the green light to the Pri@@ ority Actions in the youth field by approving a special budget heading of EC@@ U 5 million in 1992 .
• It is too early to draw general conclusions from the first year of operation of the Pri@@ ori ­ ty Actions in 1993 .
it is important to stress that one of the major by ­ products of this approach is the struggle against racism and xenophobia .
this is why the programme places great importance on : • the involvement of the young people themselves in dev@@ ising the project ; • preparation for the activity ; • the educational framework of the project .
like the preparations and the encounter itself , the assessment is an important and ind@@ i ­ sp@@ ens@@ able element in the exchange activities .
not all the youth leaders have experience of exchanges ; some do not know , or are not very familiar with , the countries with which they wish to organize the exchanges ; others have no exchange partners .
at the beginning of my talk , I said that I preferred to talk in terms of useful experience rather than in terms of adap@@ table models .
youth policy structures in Europe by Peter L@@ aur@@ it@@ zen , Youth Directorate of the Council of Europe , European Youth Centre , Stras@@ burg
two weeks from now , ministers of some 40 European states will come together in Vienna , to develop a common vision on youth in greater Europe and to agree on a number of recommendations and resolutions .
can youth policy be clearly distinguished from educational and labour market policies or are education and preparation for professional life the specific feature to refer to ?
the relationship between the government and NGOs is asymmetric ; there is a hierarchy and it has to be respected .
it is in fact afraid of the reactions of young people and needs to be constantly informed about what " they " are plan ­ ning next .
in December 1992 in U@@ tre@@ cht in cooperation with the Commission and the Council of Europe , the youth authorities of the Netherlands held a conference on a similar theme .
besides the independent youth associations , there are also youth forums affiliated to the different political parties , the number of which greatly sur@@ passes that of the associations .
the Republic of Belarus is located in the heart of Europe and has borders with Poland , Lithuania and Latvia in the west , Ukraine in the south , Russia in the north and east .
there are over 15,000 young job@@ less registered with the employment exchanges , and it is forecast that this figure may reach 7@@ 0,000 by the end of 1993 .
however , in 1993 , only 30 % of university and college graduates will be assured of a job on completing their studies .
all these problems are a matter of serious concern for the parliament and government of the Republic of Belarus . in April 1992 the Supreme Soviet adopted a Fundam@@ ent@@ als of Youth Policy Act .
the Council of Ministers has approved a programme for the implementation of an official youth policy in 1993 ­ 94 , and the national budget for 1993 includes a separate article con ­ cer@@ ned with the financing of this programme .
the main principle of relations between governmental bodies and nongovernmental organizations is that of non @@@ -@@ @ interference in each other 's affairs , with public financing for socially significant programmes launched by youth organizations .
the transition from centr@@ alism to a society of individual initiative and responsi@@ bil@@ ty is fraught with numerous difficulties and is accompanied by a dist@@ aste for organized activities and organizations .
young people play a particularly active part in the radical changes being made in the domestic economy and this activity is to a certain extent at the expense of their commitment to political questions .
a number of political parties in Bulgaria have tried and are still trying to build up their own youth structures as a means of ensuring their future survival · .
the Youth Association of the Democratic Party is a member of the International Union of Christian ­ Democratic and Conservative Youth Organizations .
the Federation of Rad@@ ical Democratic Youth Clubs was the initi@@ ator for the foundation of a Liberal Cultural and Information Centre .
however , the serious crisis in which the B@@ S@@ DP , now no longer a member of the UD@@ F , is going through , has also had consequences f@@ ó@@ r the young social democrats .
the successor of the Komsom@@ ol organization , the Bulgarian Democratic Youth ( B@@ D@@ Y ) , is based on the old Komsom@@ ol struc@@ tu ­ res and has concentrated on setting up groups outside the capital .
the B@@ D@@ Y has taken up a position in the political centre and its chairman , Ivan A@@ tan@@ as@@ sov , founded the daily news ­ paper , " Fax , " which was , however , only short@@ lived .
the Association of Independent Student Uni@@ ons ( A@@ IS@@ U ) supports the introduction of democratic structures into academic life and the raising of the standards of university education in line with the requirements of the developed industrial countries .
this organization is a co@@ founder of the UD@@ F , and stands under the spiritual patronage of the author and democr@@ at , Jordan V@@ ass@@ ilev .
furthermore , we are also trying to render assistance in order to overcome the lack of opportunities for young people to take part in international life by way of personal contacts and to contribute to international understanding .
however , it should be noted that since the fall of the total@@ i ­ T@@ Ari@@ an regime , opportunities for young people , especially in this particular area , have mar ­ k@@ edly improved .
in the Czech Republic , international contacts between children and young people have been implemented in the framework of government programmes for the support and pro ­ tec@@ tion of the younger generation since 1991 .
above and beyond such exchanges in the framework of subsidized projects there are many other projects and activities , especially in the border areas , i.e. , between individual schools on either side of the frontier .
it provides orientation towards participating in seminars , conferences and youth meetings of state and national importance on the basis of invitations issued by the host country .
for our co ­ operation with each of the countries mentioned above the draft provides an amount of K@@ C 0.5 million .
at the present time work has started in the Czech Republic to implement a project for introducing the National System of Youth Cards .
we consider the Youth Card a means of providing direct support to the processes of in@@ te ­ gration which the Czech Republic is ke@@ enly interested in .
this system provides the op@@ port@@ u ­ nity , for both organized and non@@ organized youth , of active participation in social life , without any restrictive regional barriers and across the national frontiers of the European countries .
to be able to benefit from all the advantages and possible facilities with respect to services and information which the Youth Card provides , and which makes it as attractive as it is , requires complex and difficult negotiations .
support by the state organs of the Youth Card , including '@@ financial support , is proof of the departure from the pat@@ ern@@ alism of the past when dealing with young people .
we consider the young people 's entry into the adults ' world the key area in the soci@@ alization process .
measures are implemented not just for the sake of the young people , but , above all , to encourage their active cooperation .
in the near future work shall commence on implementing the National Programme of Action for the Convention on the Rights of the Child .
it provides the guarantee for a well @@@ -@@ @ directed and efficient use of state funds and stimulates young people 's own initiative .
education In the current 1992 @@@ -@@ @ 93 school year there are 2@@ 10,@@ 19@@ 1 pupils enrolled at the general and high schools ; 18@@ ,@@ 0@@ 58 pupils at 50 vocational schools ; 1@@ 1,@@ 8@@ 82 students at 36 technical schools and 24@@ ,@@ 2@@ 26 students at 13 universities and colleges .
back in 1936 the Estonian par ­ liam@@ ent enacted legislation on the work of youth organizations setting out a framework for relations between the authorities and independent youth organizations .
prior to 1940 there were eight large , officially recognized youth organizations in Estonia ( with over 5@@ 5,000 members ) and a further 300 smaller organizations in the districts and regions .
the re @@@ -@@ @ establishment of youth organizations The traditional and new children 's and youth organizations were resurrec@@ ted in 1988 , three years before Estonia regained its independence .
despite the large number of youth associations , only 10 to 12 per cent of children are organized ( up to 30 per cent if you include the various sports and children 's clubs ) .
the EN@@ K is currently in the process of developing its activities and setting up its own offices .
this is something which may take place at schools catering for particular interests , such as art and music schools , and hobby clubs ( work@@ groups ) active in the various institutions , places of work and schools or through the youth associations .
the system of school catering for special interests is currently undergoing major ch@@ an ­ G@@ ES , particularly as far as the responsibility for such schools is concerned .
this has led to new problems in terms of finance , since the local self ­ governing bodies do not have suff@@ i ­ cient resources at their disposal .
training of youth workers The youth and sports department of the Culture and Education Ministry is working on training strategies for youth workers .
in ­ service training programmes , leading to a professional qualification , are currently in progress for 30 persons already engaged in youth work .
efforts are now being focused on identifying the principles for local structures and build ­ ing up an information transmission system .
following the collapse of the totalitarian system in the former Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc in general , Georgia embarked on a path of independent and democratic de@@ ve ­ lo@@ pment .
there were only two ways of being sent to a developing country , either one went as a lecturer or as an under@@ graduate on a 10 ­ month practical assignment .
due to both the relatively small geographical size and the linguistic isolation of Hungary , the motivation for its people to travel abroad in order to develop international relations is much stronger than in other countries .
the period follow ­ ing the signing of the Helsinki Final Act was marked by the creation of an atmosphere that facilitated the establishing of foreign relations .
( only political youth organizations organized exchanges with these countries . ) • The aim of the exchanges was primarily language learning ­ both language practice and vocational ­ cultural learning .
it is pleasing to note that the number of youth exchanges with non ­ European countries ( eg .
• We consider it to be of primary importance that in the ex ­ " Eastern bloc " countries , governmental bodies to deal with youth have been established .
their activities have enabled the establishment of agreement relationships ( for example , with Poland and the Ukraine ) and the preparation of such agreements ( with Romania , the Czech and the Slovak Repub@@ lics ) .
however , we give special attention to youth organizations ' relationships , nationalities , the handicapped and state ­ care children .
Russia is the only former Soviet rep@@ u ­ B@@ lic so far to have recognized the validity of the accord .
in this connection , it is worthwhile mentioning our recent su@@ c c@@ ess in establishing flexible structures in this area , in a number of countries with whom we are working on the basis of bilateral protocols .
the economic and financial difficulties did not prove a major obstacle to the develop ment of our exchange work .
although the economy is in a transitional period , and the financial situation is difficult , one must nonetheless create prop@@ itious conditions for young people 's development : they are , after all , society 's future .
furthermore , the core of the proposed cooperation with the Latvia @@@ -@@ @ Denmark Association deals with learning the basics of democracy through working with pupils ' councils .
the cooperation programme , which is approved and supported by the Ministry of Education , is operative in other areas as well , both at the level of national government and at the level of individual educational institutions and individual persons .
it is to be hoped that this extrac@@ ur@@ ricul@@ ar educational system will survive the difficult financial situation , because a solution to the problem of leisure time simultaneously advances the intellectual potential of the population .
it is a type of school where young people can express and discuss their views on the Objec@@ tives of society , or on certain groups within it .
yet we are moving in our own new direction , where the process of forming an organization is allowed to develop without pressure , so that it may be thoroughly understood and accepted by society .
the youth movement was well developed as early as the 1930 's ; thus many organizations need only to be renewed , or to be re@@ mod@@ elled , after organizations in other parts of the world .
the Children 's School of the Environment , the Latvian Association for the Adv@@ ancement of Youth , the Riga Environmental Protection Club and many other groups are active as well .
further exchange and educational projects have been realized thanks to the Sweden @@@ -@@ @ Latvia Association and the European Alliance of Christian Youth Associations .
these organizations , on the basis of pre @@@ -@@ @ war school and public life experiences , take the names of eminent Lithuanian historical figures ( M@@ air@@ onians , Ge@@ dimin@@ ians , M@@ ind@@ au@@ gan@@ ians etc . ) .
the activities of youth organizations are coordinated by the Ministry of Culture and Education through its Youth and Cultural Centres Department .
intensive regional border traffic has led to a wide range of relations with Belgium , the Federal Republic of Germany and France .
a special meeting is planned to take place at the European Youth Centre in Stras@@ burg to mark the platform 's tenth anniversary in 1995 .
this agency is run on a joint basis with the Service National de la Je@@ un@@ esse and the National Youth Information and Exchange Service .
there are plans , for example , to organize training programmes for youth workers for Romania in Stras@@ burg , Luxem@@ burg and Brussels in cooperation with the Youth Centre of the Council of Europe .
a meeting has been scheduled for next year to review the state of progress on youth exchanges with Central and Eastern Europe .
the decline in spiritual and cultural values , social apathy and passi@@ vity among youth , are the result of the hypo@@ critical , formal attitude taken by the totalitarian system towards the problems , interests and needs of youth .
the establishment of an inter@@ departmental Youth Affairs Committee under the auspices of the Ministry of Youth , Sport and Tourism has been proposed .
in May ­ June 1992 , K@@ ish@@ in@@ y@@ ov was the venue for a European forum of governmental and non ­ governmental organizations devoted to the soci@@ opol@@ itical situation in Europe and the prospects for cooperation among Youth .
as a consequence , the implementation of welfare services remained the domain of autonomous non ­ governmental organizations ( NGO 's ) , originally closely linked to different religious and ideological pillars in Dutch society .
parallel to this , a transformation of the traditional welfare organizations to fully profession@@ a ­ li@@ zed institutions took place , and with it , the growth of educational institutions for the training of professional social workers .
the expansion was entrusted to the " market mechanisms " of the supply of welfare services offered by private welfare institutions , and the demand for help , care and support by private citizens .
in most cases , the ideological identity has diminished as a result of secul@@ ar@@ iz@@ a ­ tion and profession@@ alization .
the main role of the Department of Welfare was re@@ defined as ' pro@@ pel ­ ling innovation ' in the field of welfare services and welfare policies .
the policy of the local welfare departments was generally to follow the initiatives taken by the institutions , provi@@ d ­ ing for them to the extent the budgets permitted .
the ' voice ' of the client / user is replaced by professional analysis of the client ­ situation and his needs .
successful experiences in this realm proved to have a positive effect on the willingness to consider further co operation at an institutional level .
it is more a consequence of the incremental tradition of finding pragmatic solutions to distinct problems , such as the necessity to cut back local government spending and the demands for services by the local population .
in the cities , many institutions , organizations and agencies for health care and welfare services are available for young people with specific socio ­ psych@@ olo ­ g@@ ical problems .
to cope with this problem a computer@@ ized registration system ( GR@@ IP ) has been devel@@ o ­ PE@@ D by the local health service of the city of Amsterdam .
with regard to the psychological state of young Roman@@ ians , studies carried out by the Youth Research Centre and the National polls Institute show that , generally speaking , there is a widely felt need for support from society .
what they mention most frequently are more reasonable prices , and guaranteed jobs and housing ; they also express a lack of confidence in the government 's ability to solve these problems .
two thirds of young people have no wish to emigr@@ ate , and those who do have no in@@ ten ­ tion of leaving for good , but only for a few years .
the aims of the youth policy pursued by the Ministry for Youth and Sports - Youth Department In the present circumstances of transition , young people are particularly susceptible to frustration and social margin@@ alization .
equally that law will define the relationship between the Ministry for Youth and Sports and association structures as that of a partnership , ruling out any kind of sub@@ ordination of the association structures .
• To encourage group activities for young people by increasing cooperation with youth associations , including the National Youth Council which is in the process of being set up , and to support projects undertaken by such associations .
• To support the organization and operation of the Advisory Youth Forum in becoming a structure for cooperation in defining youth policy priorities for the executive : the Forum 's resolutions will be equivalent to recommendations on youth activities .
• To encourage the development of forms of free association of young people ( by offering money , premises , credit ) with the aim of creating genuine group activity for young people .
• Using budget allocations to give support solely to the programmes of non ­ political youth associations and foundations , while at the same time ensuring the possibility of co ­ operation with the youth organizations of political parties .
in 1992 the proportion of people above working age in the regions of the Russian Federation was higher than the number below .
between 1987 and 1992 there was a decline in the number of births by 7@@ 00,000 , or 28 % , making a total of 1.8 million new ­ born children last year .
young people 's position in the power structure is such that their involvement in the administration of society and production activities is often limited to a merely formal role .
there has been a fundamental change in the situation of the youth and children 's move ment .
such organizations not only represent the interests of the country 's young people vis @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ vis parliament and government , but also receive assistance , usually financial , from the state .
official youth affairs organizations The Youth Affairs Committee of the Russian Federation was established in September 1992 by a directive of the Russian President .
the Committee is a central body enjoying federal executive power , carrying out government regulation and coordination between the various aspects of youth policy in the Russian Federation .
the Government of the Russian Federation has prepared a decree on the organization of the summer recreation programme in 1993 , and work is proceeding on the reorganization of the Or@@ ly@@ on@@ ok and O@@ ke@@ an national children 's holiday centres .
• As far as cooperation with child and youth organizations is concerned , contacts have been established with all major associations of this type which are active throughout Russia .
together with the relevant committee of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet , youth and children 's organizations work is in progress on drafting legislation on children 's and youth organizations in Russia .
problems and difficulties One of the main problems in putting official youth policy into practice is the lack of under standing it encounters from numerous leaders at all levels .
all youth policy in Russia is aimed at developing the innovative powers which will help young people become self @@@ -@@ @ sufficient and discover for themselves new areas of productive and creative activity .
in other words , the purpose is definitely not to put them in a position where , being " forever young , " they are entirely dependent on the parents and the " generosity " of the state .
the committee sees the following paths for international cooperation : • First , the development of bilateral cooperation based on existing government youth exchange agreements and those in the pipeline .
enclosed in this document is an additional document called " Program@@ mes of Protection and Support for the Youth in the Slovak Republic . "
the point is that a revision of traditional state pat@@ ern@@ alism is currently taking place and the principles of subsidi@@ arity are beginning to be applied to relations be ­ t@@ ween the state and youth .
this fundamental process , which deserves widespread support , is dependent , for its su@@ c ­ cess@@ ful application , on how many young people from the various associations are re@@ pres@@ en ­ T@@ ed by the Slovak Youth Council .
youth work in a particular district , or in any community or town , becomes an important part of the social infrastructure .
programmes for youth protection and promotion in the Slovak Republic in 1993 will be implemented by means of purpose ­ directed projects .
in this way the programmes '@@ can demonstrate how to generate incentives for setting up a social network which is specifically designed for the young gene ­ ration .
status of youth in the Ukraine by Dr@@ s. Alexander Ya@@ rem@@ enko , Director of the Ukrainian Scientific Research Institute for Youth Problems
for example , the average wage of a young worker amounts to only 60 per cent of the aver ­ age Ukrainian standard , and is two times less than a minimum youth consumer 's budget .
on the one hand it may appear to be quite objective if we take into account their low qu@@ ali ­ fication level , and their insufficient professional and social experience .
at the same time , however , the possibilities for them to develop this experience , to satisfy their vital interests and requirements , which are necessary in order to support a family , do not exist .
when there is no real mechanism for the state to support its youth , a constant decline in living standards of the young people occurs , which is reflected through the level of their self ­ appraisal .
thus , as for hopes for a better future , 4@@ 0.9 per cent of the young people que ­ sti@@ oned answered that they have no grounds to expect their living conditions to improve .
at the same time there is a constant increase in the divorce rate , about 40 per cent of divor@@ ces occur@@ ing amongst couples married for less than five years .
all this does not favour child ­ bearing and will lead to a future deficiency in labour resources , which will be also aggravated by a con ­ si@@ der@@ able number of people reaching retirement age .
as before , an absolute majority of the young PE@@ O ­ PL@@ E questioned ( 80 per cent ) support actions directed toward the building up of an inde@@ pen ­ dent Ukrainian State .
however , under conditions of economic destabilization , gal@@ lo@@ ping inflation and further impover@@ ishment of a considerable part of the population , the political problems in the orient@@ ations of young people are being forced into the background .
it should be added that the young people of the Ukraine ( especially students ) have already had experience in organizing and conducting different types of actions of protest and actions of civic disobedience .
in this respect the attitude of the youth of the Ukraine towards different means of political struggle is of considerable importance .
the crime rate among youth and minors has increased by 12 per cent over the last ten years , and in 1992 by 4.7 per cent over 1991 .
young people 's considerable loss of interest in reading , art and culture as a whole , gives rise to a serious concern .
this fact can be explained not only by the increase of purely " financial " interest , i.e. , the desire to accumulate money .
the number of regular visits to cu@@ l ­ Tur@@ al institutions , sports and recreational facilities has declined by between 5 ­ 10 % .
at the same time , there are no communal facilities for the spiritual development of youth in many urban areas , and especially not in villages .
but the analysis of statistical data and results of research allow a number of general conclusions to be drawn , which C@@ AN@@ NOT be dis@@ regarded .
the level of criticism and non ­ compliance with the events and the acts of the authorities , which previously took place in the Ukraine , the countries ó@@ f the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe , remains quite high .
under the influence of many social ­ economic and other factors , the value orient@@ ations of students are considerably changing from being all ­ humane to more mercanti@@ le and Pr@@ ag@@ ma ­ tic .
a youth exchange takes place between a group of young people from one country and a similar group from another @@@ -@@ @ country .
by taking part in a youth exchange , young people can experience the way of life and culture of another country at first hand .
most important , however , has been the Rem@@ o ­ Val of the political obstacle which imposed limitations on the freedom to travel .
at present it is not always possible to sur@@ mount these barriers , and even when they are sur@@ mounted it is only possible at the cost of major sacrifice on the part of most participants .
they wish to share in our experience in building up and developing a plur@@ alist , democratic youth structure and a youth welfare policy based on the principle of subsidi@@ arity .
with the unification of the two German states on 3 October 1990 , Brandenburg and the other East German federal L@@ ä@@ n@@ der were faced with the challenge of restructuring themselves from top to bottom .
the centr@@ alist structures of East Germany were replaced with the federal system as practi@@ sed in West Germany , and by the principle of local self ­ administration .
much has been achieved in just over two years , but we will be faced with another major challenge this year with the re@@ organiz@@ a ­ tion of the districts .
in practice , apart from a small number of church ­ run youth activities , there was no such thing as a range of private agencies .
this satisfied the con@@ di ­ tions required for the establishment of a Regional Youth Board , involving representatives of public bodies and private youth welfare agencies in its decision ­ making processes .
this is in no small part thanks to extensive assistance from the regions and districts with whom the Land of Brandenburg has maintained partnership relations .
apart from the organizational challenge , grouping all these functions together in a single youth work setup called for budget dec@@ i ­ sions to ensure the provision of sufficient financial and personnel resources .
there was a massive need for the right advice and , although the readiness to break new ground was rather tentative to begin with , the chance to travel and get involved in international youth exchange programmes proved irresisti@@ ble in the end .
encounters in the past were never really cent@@ red on the needs of the individual and more often than not made no attempt to famili@@ arize their participants with the everyday situation of their counterparts in the other country .
on the one hand , a certain attraction could be seen in socialism as it existed , on the other hand one could not at all be satisfied with such state ­ organized exchange programmes .
youth exchange between Eastern countries was intended to be a way of confirming the separation between East and West and of recognizing its existence in the East .
there was a joke people were telling in the West : ' people in the Soviet Union , what are they really , friends or brothers ?
and they see a long queue of people in front of the Eastern Hell who could not get in , while there was not a single person waiting in front of the Western Hell .
whereas in the West the means provided for , and the support for , youth ex@@ ch@@ an ­ G@@ ES are relatively minimal .
for Germans in the Western states we are the Far East , but for colleagues from Poland , from the Czech Republic or from Russia we are parag@@ ons of the West .
field reports and Great Britain and away from Poland and Russia , and it is impossible for us to meet this interest with the means available to us .
after all , there is no use in the long run in having small groups cultivate exchange while the real interests of exchange actually follow the general direction of migration .
in this way understanding among young people who , of course , are also dissem@@ ina ­ tors ( youth organization bureaucrats are not the only dissemin@@ ators ) is advanced in a very direct manner .
the time of the F@@ DJ , where you were a youth until you were about 50 years or so , at which stage you changed over to the adult party apparatus , is over .
so it is a fact that we are having some problems in communicating , the most basic of which being about the age difference .
are we talking about AC@@ A ­ dem@@ ic youth for example , or about the younger management layer in the economy , or are we talking about ' disadvantaged youth as indicated by Mr. T@@ sol@@ ak@@ is and the EC programmes ?
for aid , support and solidarity always become tangible when you can actually experience where they are being applied and what people are doing with them .
according to the stories people told about it , it was a rather ambi@@ valent kind of youth exchange , and those stories were told only in secret .
the first one is : in view of the scarce resources available , on what basis should young people be selected ?
as a result , youth exchanges will have to be developed on the basis of joint projects in order to main ­ tain a corresponding continuity of interest , preclu@@ ding one ­ off tour@@ istic activities .
I believe that the many pro ­ blems facing youth exchange can be clarified by using the example of the youth situation in the Eastern part of Germany .
one must look at their attitudes , at the way they perceive the unification of Germany , the opening of borders , their own new chances and opportunities , their changed life situations and their py@@ sch@@ ology .
happiness ab@@ ounded , but the first experience of exchange was that here we have the poor relative from the East and there we have the rich relative from the West .
especially as regards such national issues young people tend to react with special involvement , with special emotion .
I feel that this new generation , which bears all the signs of a post @@@ -@@ @ revolution generation , make it necessary to have an especially sensitive youth exchange .
two , three years have passed and we realize that the readiness in the Western part of Germany to share , in order to f@@ ür@@ ther the development of a common Germany , has deci@@ dedly decreased .
in the East , structures will have to be developed , and in the West , the willingness to work together on an equal basis will also have to be developed .
for even within the EC , youth work is still a very underdeveloped area , despite the brave Stru@@ g ­ gle on the part of Mr. T@@ sol@@ ak@@ is , and we will have to develop this area jointly in terms of these new tasks .
and then it will have to be interconnected with expanded forms of youth exchange in Western European countries .
I believe that one C@@ AN@@ NOT simply concentrate on an exchange between regions , but one will rather have to take a good look at the deep gap between West and East , that is , the deep gap between rich and poor .
it was under these circumstances that the idea to introduce a new str@@ and of activities , after the model of pilot projects implemented within the framework of the European Community Youth for Europe Programme , was developed .
it was therefore of particular importance that projects should be developed by young people themselves , in response to their own needs and interests , and that a wide spectrum of youth groups should be involved .
as an example of support for a new youth structure , a project prepared by the Centre for International Youth Exchange in Tor@@ un ( which has recently been established with the goal of promoting cooperation and international youth exchange ) should be mentioned .
conclusion · The idea of pilot projects supporting the innovative activities of newly @@@ -@@ @ established and existing Polish organizations within the framework of cooperation with EC partners seems to be interesting to both sides .
the poss@@ sibility of implementing various ideas with the support of T@@ emp@@ us funds has encouraged a large number of youth communities in Poland to establish international links .
firstly , we can see that there are more and more organizations of various types emerging particularly in the regions of Poland where apart from the sc@@ out movement youth structures had been non @@@ -@@ @ existent .
this is probably why there is so much interest in training courses on the one hand , and in the high quality of some of these projects on the other .
in general this is demonstrated by the fact that in a number of cases there was clearly no involvement on the Polish side in the preparation of projects .
one can question the rationale of this approach , as it does not help to create a sense of commitment and responsibility among young people .

we want to compare notes between East and West and to consider the role of independent youth work agencies : • What are independent A@@ gen ­ C@@ ies ?
• How can effective cooperation be organized between youth associations , youth groups and other independent youth A@@ gen ­ C@@ ies , i.e. what structures are required for such cooperation ?
it was widely felt that in general much must be done to accommodate the need for in@@ for ­ mation in order to facilitate youth exchange programmes .
the working group itself provides a good example of this need , as much time was given over to exchanging basic information on the countries represented , both from West and East .
• How can all young people be given the chance to work active ­ ly and self ­ confidently for their own concerns and ­ the concerns of the community ?
• the current possibilities for youth exchange in our countries and the perspectives for develop ­ ing it .
at this point , let us elaborate on the expectations the par@@ tic@@ i ­ pants of our working group had concerning future youth ex@@ ch@@ an ­ ge programmes of youth ex@@ ch@@ an ­ ge between East and West .
what are the main considerations to be taken into account when designing new programmes for East @@@ -@@ @ West youth exchange ?
youth exchange professionals , on the other hand , pointed out the specific educational requirements of international exchange programmes which have to be systematically developed anew for cooperation be t@@ ween East and West .
they are more or less efficient interim solutions in view of the fact that building systems of financing for youth policy could take several more years .
several examples of youth aid provided by such foundations and funds were presented in our working group .
they are able to enrich and complement bilateral and multi ­ lateral contacts and their supr@@ a ­ national structure pre@@ dest@@ ines them for networking , co@@ ord@@ ina ­ ting and securing contacts at all levels .
• How can self ­ confidence and a sense of identity be turned into a readiness for community inv@@ ol ­ vement ?
on the one hand , the primary processes of modernization , originating from the Western part of Germany and from West Berlin , are spreading East .
this is a process which can only become possible in an atmosphere of trust and when all sides are willing to reduce prejudices .
large organizations , such as government institutions , welfare associations and churches ( " social combines " ) , thus received some " colourful competition . "
I hope that my remarks may lead to the follow ing insight : education , the installations , services and events necessary and suitable for the fulfilment of these tasks . "
the decentralization of decision @@@ -@@ @ making structures and the meaningful delegation of social policy responsibilities is in accord with the essential features of subsidi@@ arity .
in this context training programmes are arranged for youth organizers and group leaders .
to this conception of working on the differences must be added the question of dealing with conflicts .
however , in order to be able to insti@@ gate , and follow through , a reasonably effective cros@@ scul@@ tural approach , mere additional general training is certainly not enough - specific train ing is required .
the more we can learn to overcome them without destroying each other , the more chance we have of finding constructive solutions .
experience has shown that the simple fact of human beings meeting each other does not necessarily lead to a better mutual understanding or the elimination of pre@@ conceptions .
however , the " suppression of pre@@ conceptions " continues to be one of the aims most cited in the theory of training for international youth events .
we can ask ourselves whether it is genuinely possible to wipe out such pre@@ conceptions that may form a part of an individual 's character in only a few days .
the whole art consists of creating a background against which those from other cultures are not seen from the outset as a threat , a challenge , a restriction of freedom of movement or autonomy .
one of the main problems arising in cross @@@ -@@ @ cultural encounter situations is that of knowing how to go about planning joint projects , while still managing to take into account the diversity of the feelings and cultural behavi@@ ours present .
this can lead to several variants on working in single , bin@@ ational or multinational groups , etc .
remaining with the subject of group lead ership methods , it is as well to be aware that they are not neutral , and may be the bearers of values that belong to the culture from which they eman@@ ate .
in 1968 the students of Prague and Bratislava were the first to support the reforms initiated by the Dub@@ c@@ ek government .
this enthusiasm was very short @@@ -@@ @ lived , unfortunately , and after the invasion by Russian tanks not only the youth but the whole of society fell into deep apathy .
• Projects connected with combat@@ ting drug addiction , prostitution , crime , violence , aggression toward foreign groups and religious influ@@ enc@@ es@@ . ences .
the fifth problem results from the low rate of economic activity and the growth in youth unemployment ( 49 per cent of the unemployed are under 30 years old ) .
the foundations , or other such youth structures , which do in practice have one , tend to guard it vigorously for use in their own community .
it is thus obvious that in view of this the new republics would face similar problems in building new youth work structures , especially nongovernmental organizations .
it is obvious that young people especially suffer under these circumstances .
in terms of the quantity of supplies , the situation for the population is not quite as dramatic as in the other successor republics .
after its dissolution at the Union level at the end of 1991 the organization adopted the new name of ' Union of the Youth of Belarus ' , but its popularity among young people is rapidly declining .
youth Commission , Soviet of people 's deputies , of the 24 Ob@@ lasts , Supreme Soviet of Republic of Crimea , Kiev City Soviet
nongovernmental organizations ( so @@@ -@@ @ called social organizations ) • A ' National Committee of Ukrainian Youth Organizations ' ( UN@@ K@@ MO ) was founded in April 1992 at national level .

in terms of kind of support there are again two major categories : project grants and administration grants .
following the successful development of a programme in Central Europe for the promotion of democracy , it is intended to extend the programme to the countries of the ex @@@ -@@ @ Soviet Union .
it is related to the character of government , but also to the broader environment of every citizen , from civic rights to consumer protection , from the right to assembly to the right to a free press .
the T@@ AC@@ IS programme has been created to assist the countries of the former Soviet Union to create the conditions for the development of a market economy .
while some of the instruments of support are directly related to the strengthening of understanding of the institutions and instruments of the market , these in turn are underpinned by a functioning plur@@ alistic society .
the T@@ AC@@ IS Programme will provide one @@@ -@@ @ off non @@@ -@@ @ reimbur@@ s@@ able grants to support projects designed to achieve one or more of the objectives outlined above .
this en ables a substantial measure of coordination , since the Council of Europe is represented , and there is an observer who is well informed of the activities in this field of the USA .
Implement@@ ai@@ on of projects under this facility will be monitored via detailed reporting requirements , and through the delegation of the Commission in Moscow and other NIS capitals .

T@@ emp@@ us provides support to con@@ sor@@ tia of institutions composed mainly of universities or university associations .
this study has been produced within the framework of the European Union 's T@@ emp@@ us programme , which is funded by the Europe@@ Aid Cooperation Office and the Directorate @@@ -@@ @ General for En@@ larg@@ ement .
the preparation of the report would not have been possible without the close collaboration and support provided by Eur@@ y@@ dice , the network on education systems and policies in Europe and the Bologna Fol@@ low @@@ -@@ @ Up Group .
the present report is a first attempt to describe the implementation of the Bologna Process in the countries participating in the T@@ emp@@ us programme , including signat@@ ory and non @@@ -@@ @ signat@@ ory countries of the Bologna Declaration .
the data was provided by the National T@@ emp@@ us Offices , in agreement with the national authorities and the EU Deleg@@ ations of the countries concerned .
progressively , other countries which have launched reflections and reforms of their higher education systems have used the Bologna Process and the EU Higher Education Moder@@ n@@ isation Agenda as a source of inspiration and reference .
- for the remaining countries , data was collected with the support of the National T@@ emp@@ us Offices , in close cooperation with the national authorities and the EU Deleg@@ ations concerned .
for each of these items , precise criteria have been defined which reflect different stages in the implementation of these tools and provide a comprehensive description of the current state of play of the Bologna Process .
the data was collected during the winter 2009 - 2010 and it describes the situation in the academic year 2009 - 2010 .
the aim of this report is to map , for the first time , the state of play of the Bologna Process in the 28 countries participating in the T@@ emp@@ us programme .
the report shows that certain geographical areas with common backgrounds tend to apply the Bologna Process in a similar way .
another area with a relatively homogeneous level of Bologna implementation is the region of the Western Balkans characterised by its common aspiration to acc@@ ede to the EU .
the second category contains the introduction of the Diplom@@ a Suppl@@ ement , the development of a National Quali@@ fications Framework and the setting @@@ -@@ @ up of an independent body for quality assurance in higher education .
countries of the second group - Maghreb countries , Eastern Europe and the Central Asian countries - have adopted certain elements of the Bologna Process , but are still far from full implementation .
one of the main components of the Bologna Process is the division of higher education programmes into three sequential levels namely first , second and third cycles , leading to three main kinds of qualifications and degrees : bachelor , Master and Doc@@ torate .
the choices made in the different countries seem to reflect their geo @@@ -@@ @ political context and the historical clo@@ seness between countries in certain areas .
on the other hand , countries such as Lebanon and the Maghreb countries have opted for the 180 credit model , which reflects their close connections with education systems of certain EU countries .
in practice , 60 EC@@ TS credits are attached to the workload of a full @@@ -@@ @ time year of formal learning ( academic year ) and the associated learning outcomes .
it consists of eight sections describing in particular the nature , level , context , content and status of the studies that were successfully completed .
regarding the language in which the Bologna DS is issued , the majority of T@@ emp@@ us countries issue it in the language of instruction and / or English .
however , three countries ( Bosnia and Herzegovina , Serbia and Tunisia ) have reached the level where a National Quali@@ fications Network for higher education has been formally adopted and the implementation process has started .
the Lisbon Convention has been widely ratified by the T@@ emp@@ us countries , in particular by those which are Bologna signat@@ ory countries and also members of the Council of Europe .
the three cycle degree structure is one of the main components of the Bologna Process which the signat@@ ory countries are committed to implement in view of the creation of the European Higher Education Area .
in the countries in which these concepts were rather unknown , the implementation of the three cycle structure had far reaching consequences , going beyond the simple re@@ organisation of the degree structure .
at Doc@@ toral level , as in Europe , many developments are at an early stage and common patterns are difficult to identify .
countries have adapted the Bologna principles to their own situation and may have implemented them in a flexible way to take into account specific@@ ities of the labour market , of institutions and study fields or disciplines .
countries have adapted the Bologna principles to their own situation and may have implemented them in a flexible way to take into account specific@@ ities of the labour market , of institutions and study fields or disciplines .
the EC@@ TS system was initially developed at the end of the 1980s , at the time when the Er@@ as@@ mus Programme was launched .
as a result , EC@@ TS makes teaching and learning more transparent and facilitates the recognition of studies , whether formal , non @@@ -@@ @ formal or informal .
in many countries , the introduction of EC@@ TS often started with a pilot phase and the system was then extended and phased in gradually during the second half of the 2000s .
the analysis of the level of implementation of EC@@ TS ( Map 6 ) reveals a large variety of practices and confirms that harmon@@ ised implementation is far from being the current reality .
in a third category of countries ( Algeria , Albania , Azerbaijan , Croatia , Montenegro and Tunisia ) contact hours or a combination of contact hours and student workload are still used as a reference to define the credits .
75 % or less institutions and / or 75 % or less programmes are using EC@@ TS for both transfer and accumulation purposes .
the Bologna Diplom@@ a Suppl@@ ement ( DS ) is an instrument developed jointly by the European Union , the Council of Europe and UNESCO .
it has become one of the major Bologna tools to describe qualifications in an easily understandable way and relate them to the higher education system within which they were issued .
in Israel , the DS is also issued on request and in return for payment in the language of instruction or in other languages .
in line with the commitment made by the Education Ministers in the Berlin Comm@@ uniqu@@ é ( 2003 ) , the Bologna DS should be issued automatically and free of charge to graduates at the end of their studies .
at European level , the development of National Quali@@ fications Fr@@ ame@@ works has been encouraged in recent years by a range of initiatives and processes .
in parallel to the above mentioned process , a European Quali@@ fications Framework ( E@@ Q@@ F ) for lifelong learning has been developed in the context of the Lisbon strategy and adopted by the European Council and Parliament in 2008 .
the main purpose of the E@@ Q@@ F is to act as a " translation device " and neutral reference point for comparing qualifications across different education and training systems .
these steps have been defined by the Eur@@ y@@ dice net@@ work@@ 19@@ on the basis of the recommended ten steps scale proposed by the Bologna Fol@@ low @@@ -@@ @ up Group 's ( B@@ F@@ U@@ G ) working group on Quali@@ fications Fr@@ ame@@ works led by the Council of Europe .
in Lebanon , the decision to develop a N@@ Q@@ F has been taken at the Ministry level and a N@@ Q@@ F Coordination Committee has been established .
step 5 : overall process fully completed including self @@@ -@@ @ certified compatibility with the Framework for qualifications of the European Higher Education Area .
step 2 : the purpose of the N@@ Q@@ F has been agreed and the process is under way including discussions and consultations . various committees have been established .
in higher education , quality assurance can be defined as policies , procedures and practices that are designed to achieve , maintain or enhance quality as it is understood in a specific context .
mutual recognition in the field of quality assurance in higher education calls for the development of clearly defined and commonly accepted evaluation and accreditation criteria and methodologies .
in Israel , for the moment , a government @@@ -@@ @ dependent body , the Quality Assessment Unit in the Council for Higher Education , is mainly responsible for evaluating and ac@@ crediting study programmes .
in Russia , quality assurance is also managed by independent agencies in addition to the Ministry , which shows the ongoing transition towards an independent quality assurance system .
in the five remaining countries ( i.e. Armenia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , Georgia , Kos@@ ov@@ o@@ 21 ) , the outcomes of evaluations are both decisions and advice .
the Committee of the Convention is responsible for promoting the application of the Convention and overseeing its implementation whereas the EN@@ IC Network supports the national authorities in enforcing it .
the Convention has also been signed by Belarus , Israel , Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan , which are not member States of the Council of Europe but members of the UNESCO Europe and North America region .
Tajikistan , which is also a member of the UNESCO Europe and North America region , has not signed the Convention but has ratified the text .
it aims to promote information exchange in the Mediterranean Region and create synergies with the EN@@ IC / N@@ AR@@ IC networks and those being developed in the Arab countries .
in Israel , accredited higher education institutions enjoy academic autonomy to admit students according to their own criteria .
since the beginning , T@@ emp@@ us contributes to the promotion of cooperation between higher education institutions of the European Union and the partner countries , in particular via various capacity building activities .
indeed , the Bologna Process has become a reference point for most of T@@ emp@@ us partner countries by setting in motion a series of reforms to modern@@ ise higher education systems and make them more compatible and comparable .
besides , the programme aimed at promoting inter@@ cultural understanding as a means to secure sustainable growth , peace and stability in the region and reinforce the inter@@ cultural and civil society dimension of the programme .
the programme is integrated into the European Union 's ' Neigh@@ bour@@ hood ' , ' En@@ larg@@ ement ' and ' Development ' policies , which aim to promote prosperity , stability and security in the targeted regions .
48 education level , the programme also aims at reinforcing civil society , promoting democracy , as well as enhancing mutual understanding and inter@@ cultural dialogue between the EU and its partners .
the Education , Audi@@ ovis@@ ual and Culture Executive Agency ( E@@ A@@ CE@@ A ) is responsible for both the management and the implementation of T@@ emp@@ us , under powers delegated by the European Commission .
the Bologna Process is the product of a series of meetings of Ministers responsible for higher education at which policy decisions have been taken with the goal to establish a European Higher Education Area by 2010 .
a great deal of additional information on the European Union is available on the Internet . it can be accessed through the Euro@@ pa server ( http : / / euro@@ pa@@ .@@ eu@@ .@@ int ) .
the resources made available for preparing this report were not by themselves sufficient to overcome this problem , and coverage of countries thus varies throughout the report .
first CL@@ RT@@ AP NO@@ x protocol target : stabil@@ ise at 1987 levels , EU target : 30 % from 1990 levels . 70 ( 2000 ) 105 ( 1994 ) 99 ( 1994 )
although this evaluation has been done for the whole area , targets are only valid for countries that are party in the conventions .
despite the progress apparent from Table 2 , emissions of several pollutants need to be further reduced so that targets already agreed - and new ones in prospect - can be met .
this under@@ lines the importance of reducing emissions of remaining oz@@ one@@ depl@@ eting substances ( H@@ CF@@ Cs , meth@@ yl bro@@ mi@@ de ) , and of ensuring that existing measures are properly enforced so as to advance the date of recovery of the ozone layer .
although , in the past decade , water abstraction rates have been stable or have even decreased in a number of Western and Eastern European countries , potential water shortages persist , particularly around urban areas .
implementation of local Agenda 21 policies and instruments , with their promise of significant improvement from concerted local action , is fast becoming the most crucial development in cities .
this is due , in some cases , to natural time delays ( in processes such as strat@@ osph@@ eric ozone depletion or the build @@@ -@@ @ up of phosph@@ orus concentrations in lakes ) .
more rec@@ end@@ y , the integration of environmental considerations into other policy areas and the promotion of sustainable development have come to the fore .
Rec@@ end@@ y , efforts are being made to restrain growth in the demand for transport , promote more use of public transport , and encourage new patterns of se@@ ul@@ ement and production which reduce the need for transport .
energy use , which is the basic driving force behind climate change and a number of air pollution problems , has remained at a consistently high level in Western Europe since the Dob@@ ris assessment .
in addition , there is scope for other types of measure to reduce CO , , emissions , some of which are currently being taken by various European countries and the EU .
in Western Europe , emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel use fell by 3 % between 1990 and 1995 , due to economic recession , the restructuring of industry in Germany and the switch from coal to natural gas for electricity generation .
it is based on the Protocol scenario in the 1998 W@@ MO / UNEP ozone assessment , which assumes maximum allowed emissions within protocols .
the vitality of many forests is still decreasing but , while this damage is not necessarily related to aci@@ di@@ fication , long@@ term effects of acid de@@ position on soils may be playing a role .
critical loads ( the levels of de@@ position above which long@@ term harmful effects can be expected ) are , however , still being exceeded in about 10 % of Europe 's land area , mainly in northern and central Europe .
further measures aimed at reaching the long@@ term target of the second CL@@ RT@@ AP sulphur protocol are under development in the EU , following the 5@@ E@@ AP , including reducing the sulphur content
waste Re@@ ported total waste generation in OECD Europe increased by nearly 10 % between 1990 and 1995 .
the Russian Federation accounted for about two @@@ -@@ @ thirds of the 30 million tonnes of hazardous waste generated per year by the whole of Eastern Europe during the early 1990s .
this is mainly caused by damage to their habitats by land @@@ -@@ @ use changes , particularly through intensi@@ fication of agriculture and forestry , increasing infrastructure development , water abstraction and pollution .
the main causes are land re@@ clamation , pollution , drainage , recreation and urban@@ isation .
" extensive " forest management , formerly the most common practice , continues to be replaced by more intensive and uniform management .
with the disappearance of their often very rich plant and animal life , the natural biodiversity of the open landscape has severely diminished .
nit@@ rate concentrations are low in northern Europe , but high in several Western and Eastern countries , with frequent exceed@@ ances of the EU maximum admissible concentration .
integrated pol@@ ices for the protection of inland waters are in place in many areas of Europe , for example around the North Sea , the Baltic Sea , the Rhine , the El@@ be and the Danube .
although the Environmental Programme for Europe called for the identification of contaminated sites , a complete overview is not yet available for many countries .
another severe problem is soil loss through sealing under constructions , such as industrial premises and transport infrastructure , reducing soil use options for future generations .
the rapid increase in private transport and resource @@@ -@@ @ intensive consumption are major threats to the urban environment and , consequently , to human health and welfare .
annual lead concentrations dropped sharply in the 1990s because of the reduction in the lead content of petrol , and there seems to be evidence that concentrations of other pollutants are also falling .
the corresponding number of people exposed to summer smo@@ g conditions ( related to ozone ) is 37 million , with nearly 40 million people experiencing at least one exceed@@ ance of the WHO guidelines every year .

since 1991 , useful work , In a variety of different forms , has been done to assist partner countries through the T@@ ac@@ is programme .
here , the reference material has been consolidated and a greater emphasis has been placed upon suggestions for active and modern teaching exercises .
the revision and additional material has been provided by two consulting firms , ET@@ SU and fiel@@ d@@ work , both from UK .
the hand@@ book has a broad scope Inclu@@ ding the origins of energy , the sources and extraction of fossil fuels , nuclear power , electricity generation and transmission , and the use of energy In society .
the hand@@ book has been written with a structure enabling you to quickly Identi@@ fy the main themes of individual sections , the information presented for reference and the sugg@@ es ­ tions for teaching activities .
for example , In the section Why energy is Import@@ ant you could present the first theme as an objective - ' St@@ u ­ dents should understand the significance of energy in mankind 's social and industrial development ' .
without modern pollut@@ ant ab@@ at@@ ement systems coal power stations release smoke , ash and other pollutants such as sulphur dioxide , nit@@ ric ox@@ ides and heavy metals .
encourage groups of students to compile lists of questions about the distribution of the world 's E@@ ner ­ gy resources , then to research answers to the questions with Information from a library , databases or the Internet .
an energy time line might include events such as the opening of a coal mine , the first street lighting , the first cars , the arrival of m@@ ains electricity etc .
students would collect information for their time lines by Inter@@ viewing local officials or older relatives , or by collecting information from local newspaper archives .
the time @@@ -@@ @ scale of this process is so huge , compared to that of mankind 's development , that the reserves are considered to be finite and our continued extraction will ultimately depl@@ ete known reserves completely .
there ¡ s a ver / high degree of uncertainty and only 1 in 10 of the explor@@ ations are typically successful .
these off @@@ -@@ @ shore Loc@@ a ­ tions use drilling platforms or oil @@@ -@@ @ ri@@ gs and the process is more complicated and haz ­ ardous .
this tech ­ ni@@ que works using a distil@@ lation column with graduated temperatures at which the various components , or fr@@ actions , of oil are separated out , conden@@ sed and collected .
students can examine the fr@@ actions obtained and see how they differ from the original fluid from which they came .
although world trade In oil is governed by international agreements between countries and multinational companies , possession of oil reserves remains a very Import@@ ant str@@ ate ­ G@@ IC strength .
natural gas is colour@@ less , od@@ our@@ less gas comprising largely methane and small quantities of other hydrocarbons such eth@@ ane and pro@@ pane .
the use of natural gas as a primary fuel is relatively recent , as for many years gas was seen as a necessary by @@@ -@@ @ product from the extraction of crude oil .
as crude oil reserves are extracted , natural gas accumul@@ ates in the upper Cha@@ m ­ bers of the se@@ am and can be recovered once the extraction of crude is no longer viable .
in this type of gas field , quantities of pro@@ pane and but@@ ane are also recovered which are utilis@@ ed for domestic and industrial use as L@@ PG ( liquid pro@@ pane gas ) .
natural gas is also found In dry se@@ ams , not in association with oil , as in the extensive Russian and NIS region gas fields . detection and extraction techniques are similar to those for oil .
a major pipeline project is currently underway In Latin America to bring gas from the An@@ des in the West of the continent , across the Amazon Basin to supply the industrial regions of Brazil In the East .
however , the oil crises of the 1970s and the relative abundance of coal has restored the balance and coal will remain a very significant fuel well into the future .
the main uses of coal today are : • as fuel in ther@@ mo @@@ -@@ @ electric power stations • within the iron and steel industry , both as raw material for coke and as a fuel for sm@@ elt ­ ing and heating processes .
now where the se@@ am is of sufficient thickness and regularity the coal face can be worked by sophistic@@ at ­ ed machines which cut the coal and transport It back to the vertical sha@@ fts in automated w@@ agons .
show the coal face galleries , the vertical lift sha@@ fts , the venti@@ la ­ tion sha@@ fts and other features which demonstrate its workings .

► the concepts of nuclear fis@@ sion and nuclear fusion ► the principle of how a nuclear power station works ► radiation risks , safety and the issue of waste disposal .
nuclear programmes were taken up by most Indu@@ str@@ i ­ alised countries and nuclear stations have been operating for over 30 years .
even after this time a satisfactory solution for the storage of , even medium and low level , radioactive waste has not been agreed .
this is the reaction that sust@@ ains the heat of the sun and takes place at a temperature of around 15 million degrees cent@@ i ­ grade !
whilst overall dependence on nuclear power is less than a fifth of electricity generation capacity , some countries have invested heavily in nuclear power .
nuclear power stations do not release dangerous radiation when in normal operation , and there have been very few nuclear incidents that have actually caused harm to human health .
the Chernobyl acc@@ i ­ dent raised awareness of the importance of international dialogue to control nuclear energy and the crucial need to set In place adequate security measures .
ask the students to imagine that a nuclear power station is to be built near to the school .
students should be given information sheets explaining something about the proposed site and the economic case for the power station .
you want the power station to be built because you think that nuclear power is a clean and efficient way to build up the prosperity in the region .
towards the end of the preparation phase , teachers should check that the groups are ready to proceed with the role play during the following session .
ask the students to draw comparisons and contrasts between nuclear and conventional fossil fuel generating stations .
the rivers are fed by rain which Is created by the conv@@ ection cycle of water vap@@ our from oceans and lakes , again driven by the heat of the sun .
individual cells generate only around 1 wat@@ t of electricity , however when multiple cells are connected together In panels to form an array they can produce tens of kilow@@ at@@ ts .
Silicon technology has advanced greatly In recent years , improving the efficiency of solar panels and reducing their cost .
the early sailing ships relied solely on the wind for motive power , wind@@ mills have been used for centuries for pumping water and grinding corn .
multiple arrays , called wind @@@ -@@ @ farms typically use turbines of around 300 kW which may stand 50@@ m high and have a blade diameter of 30@@ m .
this increases the cost , and the technical challenges are harder , yet the wind resources are better and the issues of visual and noise In@@ tru@@ sion resolved .
the head or ' n@@ ac@@ elle ' of the turbine Is also turned by a y@@ aw motor so that it continually faces into the direction of the wind .
the turbines blades , perhaps each being 15@@ m long for a 300 kW machine , are as@@ se@@ m ­ bled by hand from a composite glass fibre material reinforced with wood or aluminium .
land@@ fills should be carefully prepared and man ­ aged to prevent le@@ aching of poll@@ uting materials In@@ to underground water courses , and to prevent dangerous build @@@ -@@ @ up and release of methane rich gas .
students should understand : • the different ways in which energy can be harn@@ essed from rivers and oceans • the advantages and drawbacks of hydroelectric power .
cold water Is pumped down through one bore hole and Is heated by the rock before passing back to the surface .
they should have collected sufficient data to draw some more general conclusions about vertical axis wind@@ mills .
► electricity as a clean and convenient means of transferring energy ► the operating principles of a ther@@ mo @@@ -@@ @ electric power station ► the efficiency losses In@@ vol@@ ved in generation and transmission of electricity .
the rate at which energy is used or released is measured in wat@@ ts ( W ) and would be the amount of heat energy In j@@ ou@@ les that was given off per second by burning the coal .
the water Is temperature is raised to form high pressure steam which is then expanded through the blades of a steam turbine , causing it to rotate at great speed .
the generation process converts the chemical energy of the fuel into thermal energy ( steam ) which Is then conden@@ sed through the turbine giving mechanical energy , and final ­ ly the generator converts this turning into electricity .
modern natural gas stations ( called combined cycle ) and advanced coal stations ( not yet fully commercial ) are more efficient and over 50 % Is typical .
a specific problem for the energy industry is the non @@@ -@@ @ payment of energy bills by con ­ sum@@ ers - Industrial and resid@@ enti@@ al@@ 1 .
once this has been completed the students can write a leaf@@ let for their class ­ mates about the advantages and disadvantages of their particular source of energy .
the dependence on fuel imports is reduced , and for countries that export primary energy more can be sold - in both cases the nation ­ al economic balance of payments is improved .
some are related to the building itself , to the types of fuel used and the appliances and other E@@ ner ­ gy using devices in the home .
the care@@ t@@ aker would also be able to explain to the students about the kinds of lights used In different rooms .
levels of insulation on pi@@ pe@@ work could be investigated and temperature differences in di@@ f ­ fer@@ ent parts of the pi@@ pe@@ work and school measured .
students could examine school plans and builders ' draw ­ ings to find out about standards of insulation in the walls and roof of the building .
the School Princip@@ al could be invited to a future lesson to discuss the survey findings and the survey 's recommendations .
the countries of the former Soviet Union have In@@ her@@ ited an Industrial base that is among the most energy intensive in the world .
many countries In the West have insti@@ gated programmes and In@@ c@@ enti@@ ves to encourage a switch from private car usage to greater use of public transport .
some of the reasons are a lack of good insulation In buildings , poor efficiency of ageing municipal heating networks and the inability ( or incentive ) for individual families to control their heating use .
examples of the type of Information that can be us@@ efully collected are given in the previous sections of this hand@@ book and in the box below . energy statistics can be compiled from many other sources .

this brochure explains the meaning of a co @@@ -@@ @ operative today , presenting various aspects involving the creation and profitable functioning of a modern co @@@ -@@ @ operative .
the collapse of the former centr@@ alised command system and the disintegration of the state @@@ -@@ @ owned distribution scheme resulted in a completely dis@@ organised agricultural sec ­ tor very often to the detriment of the producers ' interests .
however , having benefited from their former links to obtain the necessary lic@@ ences , they now enjoy a dominant position whereby they control most of the logistical aspects .
these co @@@ -@@ @ operatives have progressively grown and nowadays , most of them each have several hundred members .
the way that a co @@@ -@@ @ operative deals with its members , determines its prices and the way that it is financed results from that .
the result is distributed in the form of reb@@ ates and price compl@@ ements to farmers
the members pool together the results of their activity : for example , their produce to be marketed or processed , and / or their means of production .
if so , no one would be prepared to accept anymore the constraints set down by membership
in this case the non @@@ -@@ @ member farms were able to benefit from wholesale prices , but they refused to take delivery of the goods they had ordered , and Agr@@ o @@@ -@@ @ Dni@@ ep@@ r was never paid .
on the other hand , the manager signed contracts for the sale of commodities that the producers could not deliver .
it is therefore understandable that the co @@@ -@@ @ operatives also provide services to non @@@ -@@ @ members , who were previously used to using the same facilities and equipment .
another way to finance this working capital is to ask the members for monthly or quarter ­ ly subscriptions .
should a co @@@ -@@ @ operative make advanced payments for the products delivered by the me@@ m ­ bers - but this Is unlikely at least at the beginning - It would also require a corresponding level of working capital .
different criteria may be used to ap@@ praise the volume of the activity : yearly turnover with the co @@@ -@@ @ operative , volume of subscri@@ bed services , ac@@ re@@ age of the farm , etc .
in fact , ac@@ re@@ age , which is directly linked to activity , is a convenient basis for calculating a first payment .
later on , the co @@@ -@@ @ operative may retain extra shares In proportion to the activity each member has had with the co @@@ -@@ @ operative .
payment of agricultural produce to producers , according to " provisional price " + complementary payment ( CP ) according to extra prices
attention has to be paid to the particul@@ arities of the taxation system , in order to avoid undue taxes .
VAT , for example , is based on the difference between the purchasing and selling price ; it is the final selling price of inputs - and not the provisional one - that has to be taken In@@ to consideration .
when determining the provisional prices , co @@@ -@@ @ operatives have to take into account both the expected cost prices for produce and services ( Table 5 ) and the existing market environment .
if the co ­ operative has several activities , these expenditures have to be distributed among the var ­ IO@@ Us activities .
direct costs and specific costs ( i.e. the fixed costs that are directly linked to an activity ) are charged to the related activity . the co @@@ -@@ @ operative 's over@@ heads have to
be distributed among the various activities ; there are no rules about how to do this , and any approach can be chosen , according to the specific situation of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative ' .
transportation Storage ( piece @@@ -@@ @ work ) customs consum@@ able ( additives , packaging materials , energy , ... ) transport and marketing costs
however , determination of provisional prices should not result only from a price / cost cal ­ cul@@ ation , but should also take In@@ to consideration the market environment and the co ­ operative pricing policy .
the use of the financial surplus is a strategic decision which requires that consideration be given to four key ele ­ ments .
determination of reb@@ ates and price compl@@ ements is a strategic decision which has important consequences on the future development of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative .
as a matter of fact , they expect to be better off when dealing through the co ­ operative , and some significant signs that this is true should be given .
if the co @@@ -@@ @ operative is involved in both input supply and marketing activities , the shares to be allocated respectively to price compl@@ ements and to reb@@ ates have to be determined .
a co @@@ -@@ @ operative aims to provide the best solutions for ensuring that the members receive the necessary supplies .
selling prices should include all costs ( transportation , credit and guarantee ) .
difficulties in paying the remainder at H@@ ar ­ v@@ est time still occurred , but it would have been disastrous if the producers had not had to make a pre@@ payment .
every creditor requires a certain level of self @@@ -@@ @ financing ; therefore a co @@@ -@@ @ operative has to pass this requirement on to its members .
the preparation of an application is time @@@ -@@ @ consuming : only after one or two years of operation , once a co @@@ -@@ @ operative has acquired some strength , could such an application be considered .
processing enterprises face considerable difficulties with raw material supplies , and as a result they understand that for them , supporting agricultural production is a priority investment .
in the current situation , they are obliged however to manage a greater number of SE@@ PA ­ rate contracts with many more producers .
the co @@@ -@@ @ operative met a lot of difficulties in selling this oil , and finally signed a contract for sun@@ flower meal sales , which the oil plant agreed to lend instead of the oil .
nevertheless , as the fulfilment of this contract was due to take place after the delivery date of the supplies , the co @@@ -@@ @ operative applied for a short @@@ -@@ @ term bank credit .
the conditions proposed by the bank were very un@@ favourable , but the co @@@ -@@ @ operative 's competitive edge was such that the con@@ di ­ tions made to the members remained attractive .
finally , thanks to the support of the oil plant , the co @@@ -@@ @ operative was able to fulfil with only a slight delay the orders placed by the producers .
the risk is limited for the processing plant : sooner or later , the co @@@ -@@ @ operative will have to deliver raw materials to the plant .
a guarantee system has to be set up with regard to : - compliance with creditor 's requirements - security for the co @@@ -@@ @ operative - ensuring costs are as low as possible .
of course , the producer is also a member of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative and all the relevant clauses included in the statutes , as well as in the rules and regulations , apply to this transaction .
with regard to fuel , the price of which can vary a lot during the season , the provisional price should be Est@@ a ­ blis@@ hed several times a year , for example every third month .
members may use their own means of transport for carrying their own produce - and even the produce of other members - and get reimbur@@ sed by the co @@@ -@@ @ operative for trans ­ port expenses .
the trends of the market have therefore to be ca@@ u ­ ti@@ ously ap@@ praised , and a good balance between selling at harvest time and postp@@ oning the sale has to be done .
small scale processing units generally have a poor level of efficiency in terms of quality and profitability .
when such opportunities are not available , a good solution can be to develop partner ­ ships with existing processing plants and to set up piece @@@ -@@ @ work processing contracts .
in Bro@@ dy , L@@ vo@@ v Region , the canned pe@@ as processed by the plant - which is a member of the Bro@@ dy F@@ arm@@ ers ' Association - are marketed either directly by the members , or colle@@ c ­ tively by the co @@@ -@@ @ operative .
in Zapor@@ oz@@ hy@@ e , the private farmers ' co @@@ -@@ @ operative In@@ k@@ orn signed a contract with the oil plant for piece @@@ -@@ @ work processing .
therefore , me@@ m ­ bers C@@ AN@@ NOT deliver as much produce as they may want to , but their rights to benefit from processing services are defined by the co @@@ -@@ @ operative 's rules .
members are entitled to deliver products In proportion with their subscri@@ p ­ tion , but the quality of the produce should also be taken into consideration .
as far as the members ' produce is concerned , a co @@@ -@@ @ operative which Is just starting , lack ­ ing working capital , can hardly make advance payments to the producers at delivery time .
the provisional price has to be established very cauti@@ ously , taking into account the possible drops in the mar ­ K@@ et .
of course , in both situations , a complement of price will be determined according to the co @@@ -@@ @ operative 's financial surplus , as described above .
a good solution is to set a provisional price based on the market price of the raw mater@@ i ­ al - for example , the price usually paid by the processing plants .
in Or@@ he@@ i district , Moldova , the vil ­ l@@ age co ­ operatives took over the machinery of the former collective farm and provide the small Individual farms with mechan@@ isation services .
this issue was discussed within the In@@ k@@ orn co @@@ -@@ @ operative in Zapor@@ oz@@ hy@@ e , as the creation of a machinery @@@ -@@ @ pooling department within the co @@@ -@@ @ operative was on the agenda .
generally subscriptions for the use of a tractor are allocated on a time basis , though they are allocated on a per hectare basis for the other pieces of equipment .
each member commits himself to use the services of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative for a period of several years according to the subscriptions paid .
therefore the rules relating to the use of equipment , the responsibilities of each member and the planning of use have to precise ­ ly defined .
in a smaller scale machinery @@@ -@@ @ pooling co @@@ -@@ @ operative , responsibility is shared among the members : for each piece of equipment , a particular member is made responsible .
the price charged for the services must cover all the expenses and enable the co @@@ -@@ @ operative to replace equipment .
a tariff is set for each crop operation , generally not In money but in account units .
the balance can be carried over to the following season or cancelled through use of working days .
the provision of advisory services has no significant effect on the purchasing price paid to producers , and is regarded by the members as another advantage offered by the co @@@ -@@ @ operative .
the executive manager 's activity should be closely controlled by the producers and there should be a mutual trust and dialogue between the President and the Executive Manager . these are the keys to an efficient management .
the members however , have to be aware that achievement of the objectives does not depend only on the sal@@ ari@@ ed team , but also a lot on their own behaviour .
should the producers not feel themselves involved in the co @@@ -@@ @ operative 's management , they will not comply with the rules and commitments , and the co @@@ -@@ @ operative would lose Its economic efficiency .
the ideal manager is hard to find : he must have business ac@@ umen , be a good organis@@ er and help the co @@@ -@@ @ operative to define its long @@@ -@@ @ term strategy .
the difficulties faced by Agr@@ o @@@ -@@ @ Dni@@ ep@@ r resulted from priority being given to the com ­ mer@@ cial function over relations with producers .
then , the larger the volume of activity , the more important staff needs to be and the higher over@@ heads that the co @@@ -@@ @ operative can afford will be .
among them , the Advisory Centre Ag@@ ro@@ T@@ av@@ ria in Mel@@ it@@ opol particularly focuses on support to co @@@ -@@ @ operatives .
Ag@@ ro@@ T@@ av@@ ria fostered the creation of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative Inter@@ t@@ av@@ ria and provided it with assistance for statute elaboration , registration , negotiation with suppliers and cred@@ i ­ tors , establishment of contracts with members and partners .
leading the works of the Com@@ missions E@@ lab@@ oration of Rules and Regulations Assistance to preparation of reports to General Assembly Information to members
the first step consists in setting up a group of producers and providing them with in@@ for ­ mation and training about co @@@ -@@ @ operative principles .
starting a co @@@ -@@ @ operative is not an easy process : the more homogeneous and united the group is , the stronger the co @@@ -@@ @ operative will be when facing problems .
in Mel@@ it@@ opol , Zapor@@ oz@@ hy@@ e Region , the creation of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative Inter@@ t@@ av@@ ria was su@@ p ­ ported by the Advisory Centre .
• The efficiency of a co @@@ -@@ @ operative results from grouping producers ' supply needs and their offer of products ; private farmers will benefit from the economic weight of collective farms .
a co @@@ -@@ @ operative can be specialised in one particular type of production or in several , and specialised in one type of service or in several ( multi@@ purpose co ­ operatives ) .
• If the activity in which the co @@@ -@@ @ operative is involved should face critical pro@@ b ­ l@@ ems , the whole co @@@ -@@ @ operative would be jeopar@@ dis@@ ed .
nevertheless , the hypothesis of ex@@ cl@@ u ­ sion , or the voluntary departure of co @@@ -@@ @ operative members also have to be considered in the statutes .
in the co ­ operative , a part of the provisional result is distributed to the members in the form of complement of prices and reb@@ ates .
when a legislation on agricultural co @@@ -@@ @ operatives exists , it has to be used , even if it is so far not fully satisfactory .
the law provides for an acceptable statute of the co ­ operative , but so far nothing has been improved relating to taxation issues .
it is difficult to say how long the preparation stage will last : it depends on the local situ@@ a ­ tion and on the pace of the producers ' reflection .
experience shows that once the pro ­ duc@@ ers are informed about co @@@ -@@ @ operative principles , a further period of about six months is required .
if the co @@@ -@@ @ operative has to apply for credit , this can require at least another six months .
the second solution is preferable , since it gives plenty of time to work on the project du@@ r ­ ing the winter .
competition between co @@@ -@@ @ operatives and commercial firms has less@@ ened their differences : in order to attract producers ' deliveries , commercial firms are compelled to propose conditions as favourable as those of co @@@ -@@ @ operatives .
however , in most cases , the co @@@ -@@ @ operatives respect the co @@@ -@@ @ operative spirit , even if some flexibility is required .
at the input level , as far as input supply and machinery @@@ -@@ @ pooling activities are concerned , it is the members who are the co @@@ -@@ @ operative 's market .
should the co @@@ -@@ @ operative intend to have its own processing facilities , a thorough analysis should be carried out : description should be made of the equipment and civil works requirements , nominal capacity , production planning and maintenance envisaged .
indeed , the profitability of the co @@@ -@@ @ operative project C@@ AN@@ NOT be demonstrated by its financial results since the co @@@ -@@ @ operative does not aim at making profit for itself .
cash flow state ­ ments for the co @@@ -@@ @ operative as well as for the farms attest to the capacity of the co @@@ -@@ @ O@@ per ­ ative to face its operating expenses and re@@ payments .

some information on the project Title Training centre for energy management Results Assessment of the needs of Ukrainian companies in energy management training .
this brochure describes the development of a training centre for energy management and its role In meeting national training needs , taking as an example the experience of the Kiev centre In Ukraine .
without updating the necessary skills and competencies of business and energy management , these efficiency actions and Investments will not be realised .
the Governments of most NIS countries are promoting a rational and efficient use of energy In all sectors of the economy .
industrial and management training Is not widely available In Ukraine . this type of training is a cy@@ c@@ lic process , In@@ vol@@ ving regular re @@@ -@@ @ tr@@ al@@ ning and skills development .
it is often at odds with the traditional university environment with Its academic and research @@@ -@@ @ orient@@ ated approach which can appear of little direct relevance to managers In industry .
this training should include energy efficiency technologies and market orient@@ ated management skills and should provide an accredited energy manager speci@@ alisation .
the shorter term aim of an energy training centre is to provide a national spear@@ head In energy management training and a regional focus for activities in the area where the centre is located .
the project has been implemented in close co @@@ -@@ @ operation with the State Committee of Energy Sav@@ ing and the Ministry of Science and Education .
the building and installed demonstrations are used to explain modern energy management and efficiency techniques .
isolation from the main heating system required Installation of a stand @@@ -@@ @ alone electric boiler - a stand @@@ -@@ @ alone gas boiler would not be permitted under current Ukrainian building regulations .
the computers In the classroom can be operated as stand @@@ -@@ @ alone machines or as slaves to the In@@ struc@@ tor 's computer which also provides the main station for the BE@@ MS .
the core of the management system ¡ s a database , which Is used to compile Information on staff@@ ing , training programmes , evaluation and expenditure .
now although management In Ukrainian enterprises has become more autonomous with moves towards privatisation , the critical shortage of capital Is cur@@ t@@ ailing Investment In new projects .
in the modern " energy management " role it is these demand Issues that dom@@ i ­ N@@ ate .
figure 2 shows the extensive breadth of topics within the training modules to be dev@@ el ­ O@@ PE@@ D and the training requirements for each target group .
to complement this ongoing process of evaluation and refin@@ ement , broader reviews of the effectiveness of the training are carried out on a periodic basis , say every six months .
future training activities will also be carried out in this active learning style , making use of experience gained from Ukrainian projects to supplement other outside examples .
of the 28 instructors ten were selected from cities outside Kiev which represent major Ukrainian urban centres with the potential to establish regional energy management training centres .
however , the demand for training will be determined by the willingness and ability of the enterprises , or other Government and International organisations , to fund the training .
the preferred option by the European experts , NT@@ U@@ U and the Ministry of Education was for the training centre to have partial autonomy within the framework of the NT@@ U@@ U .
on completion of the T@@ AD@@ S project the Centre will be given financial autonomy within NT@@ U@@ U and all of the equipment proc@@ ured under the project will be retained by the Centre .
if the economy 's present stagnation continues for a number of years the Centre 's sustain@@ ab@@ ill@@ ty will have to be re @@@ -@@ @ defined , and alternative sources of financing will have to be sought .
the main difficulties encountered by the project arose from a lack of appreciation of the concept and role of the energy manager amongst Ukrainian Government .
obtaining the necessary lic@@ ences for accreditation of the courses also required a major effort in producing the necessary documentation to cover training of each of the target groups - In@@ struc@@ tors , students , managers in industry , etc .
the Centre is therefore developing a client base that Inclu@@ des International A@@ gencies , In@@ stitutes , State Committees and U@@ tilities
energy plays a critical role In industrial and economic development and NIS governments are recogn@@ ising the crucial importance of improving the way energy is used In all sectors of the economy .
it will provide a focus for energy management in Ukraine and , by the high quality of the training provided and the training facilities offered , is already gaining a strong reputation and credibility throughout the region .
its success In the longer term will be proved by Its ability to attract commercial training activities , to cover the expenses of running the Centre and to develop new training activities .
a second T@@ AD@@ S project will assist the Centre In this transition period of two years whilst the commercial markets for training are tested , additional training modules developed and the reputation of the centre established .
should the demand prove sufficient , the In@@ tention is to establish a network of up to 10 further regional Energy Management train ing centres .

the aim of the brochure is to provide references and help to enterprises ' managers and shareholders faced with similar difficulties as the ones which were plagu@@ ing the enterprise described in the presented cases .
privatisation programmes have some ­ how progressed ( at a slower pace in Ukraine than in Russia ) , but the strategy for owner ­ ship reforms , and restructuring of enterprises has still to be defined .
most enterprises have seen their sales drop by a F@@ AC ­ tor of 50 or more per cent if compared to 1990 , and they understand that they C@@ AN@@ NOT rely anymore on the State to save them .
many enterprise managers have dreamed of the white k@@ night foreign investor , bringing money , but not interfering in the management .
very often enterprises are affected by a poor layout of the plant and by rigi@@ di@@ ties in pro ­ duction due to the tradition of long production bat@@ ches .
it is a necessary measure for enterprises over@@ loaded with debts . however , creditors will not accept to initiate it in the absence of a credible plan for overall restructuring and recovery .
in the absence of such com ­ mit@@ ment , any attempt to restructure a company will quickly ab@@ ort as the most important measures will not be taken by the management and the shareholders .
the consultants will act as cataly@@ sts , and will stimulate the recovery process of the enterprise .
to maxim@@ ise the adv@@ ices provided by the consultants , the manager has to allocate one or several professionals to work with the consultants so as to help them to make the diagnosis as quickly as possible .
but in the most important phase , the implementation , the staff of the enterprise should be In the fore front , with the constant support of the consultants ' team .
they cover enter@@ pr@@ is ­ es of different sizes , in@@ .@@ Russia and in Ukraine , enterprises of different origins from all@@ union to local enterprises .
however , it is interesting to see that there are results , even when the prognosis was not very favourable at the onset of the project .
financiers are not rushing to a company , but want to feel secure that their investments will be repaid thanks to the good strategy and management of the company .
the work with enterprises and the success of restructuring would extend beyond the ind@@ i ­ vi@@ dual cases and the initial results which have been achieved , and are reported in this hand@@ book .
it is evident that there is a burgeoning demand for " restructuring , " or more precisely for Im@@ proving the situation of enterprises which are faced with unprecedented problems .
short term actions are not sufficient , but the necessary step to ensure the success of the longer term restructuring .
but Russian or Ukrainian enterprises have shown that they have significant possibilities of productivity improvements and cost savings .
this is also particularly true when the enterprise needs to get rid of social assets and services and to transfer them to the com ­ mun@@ ity .
as said above , the key to a successful restructuring is motivation for changes , and set ­ ting @@@ -@@ @ up joint task @@@ -@@ @ forces between the outside advisers and the enterprise staff .
it is difficult to identify criteria to measure success in advance , but in the long term , fin@@ an ­ cial sustain@@ abl@@ lity and improved profitability are certainly one criteria or THE criteria .
this is very important for the company which will need to tap the financial markets to finance development and new investments .
the rubber company had already negoti@@ at ­ ed a joint venture , but was not capable to reap the fruit of the venture .
while everybody recogn@@ ises that the issue of social assets is critical and has to be addressed , it is beyond the capabilities of the external assistance to help div@@ est them .
in its shrinking domestic market , E@@ Z@@ SK consistently loos@@ ing share ( 30 % market share in 1994 ) to Voron@@ esh Rub@@ ber Plant ( V@@ Z@@ SK ) who holds a 70 % market share .
the main rea ­ son is the higher willingness of V@@ Z@@ SK to trade on a bar@@ ter ­ basis .
based on the above diagnosis and following recommendations , mixed teams E@@ Z@@ SK / consultants were constituted and jointly searched for applicable practical solutions .
this required the following tasks : - definition of a multi source but@@ adi@@ ene supply strategy - re@@ negotiating actual contract terms - optim@@ isation of logistic costs .
this allows E@@ Z@@ SK to finance export business both from the western border to customers and for the time from the product leaving the factory to arrival at the western distribution terminal .
nevertheless , during this same period , E@@ Z@@ SK auto @@@ -@@ @ financed a $ 2.8 million investment to diversify its production and reduce dependence towards the tyre industry .

these segments of the market had also varied characteristics in this respect : • in the consultants ' analysis , the export sales did not allow to cover the company 's over@@ heads in a full cost calculation .
the lack of cash In the company made it difficult to pay the salaries ( up to 5 months delay ) and the taxes .
it was all the more difficult to launch new productions , requiring the purchase of raw materials .
but some social assets had already been or were going to be transferred to external authorities ( L@@ utsk city for instance ) such as kindergarten or a hostel .
in order to achieve better sales in particular on the spare parts business , L@@ utsk B@@ earing Plant created a network of dealers in Russia and Ukraine .
case n ° 2 : L@@ utsk bearing plant continuing bar@@ ter activity and increase the share on NIS market , though improving the quality of the bar@@ ter contracts and final cash collection .
in order to Incre@@ ase margins on export markets , the consultants advised to seek direct con ­ t@@ acts with final customers , and started to take contacts together with the commercial team .
in order to export directly , It was also necessary to design a new packaging and a catalogue in several languages .
the main positive point for the company in an increase in sales , after several years of decrease .
for the first seven months of 1997 L@@ utsk B@@ earing Plant has produced for Gr@@ y@@ v@@ nas 13@@ ,@@ 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ( $ 7,@@ 39@@ 8,@@ 300 ) .
the equipment which had been pur ­ ch@@ ased was used in order to increase the efficiency and quality level of the existing lines .
the quality of the production was ME@@ DI ­ um , considering the requirements of the internal market , but low regarding the ex@@ ig@@ en ­ C@@ ies of the international market .
the increased export share has generated an extremely positive cash @@@ -@@ @ flow to the com ­ p@@ any that achieved the target to lower bar@@ ter weight .
the company had three main production lines : • assembling of tubes and elements for house construction plum@@ bing ( pressure , S@@ ani ­ T@@ ary and heating systems ) .
short @@@ -@@ @ time factory lock@@ outs and stops of production due to lack of orders were usual In the period of the study .
the growth In demand of is@@ o ­ l@@ ating and energy saving materials , related to the customers ' needs for better comfort and quality , creates new potential opportunities for business activities of K@@ SE@@ P .
the financial situation of the company reflected the difficulty of working with a single client : • the level of stocks remained high and imp@@ acted on the cash management of the enterprise .
the president of the companies started making dec@@ i ­ sions not on his own , but in consultation with deputy directors acquiring more respon@@ si ­ bility .
in addition , statistics show that more than 200 different clients have been putting orders between June 1996 and June 1997 .
the marketing department has gained significant experience , for instance : • promotion to prospective clients by means of mailing : 6@@ 32 commercial letters and price lists m@@ ailed .
available commercial information on competitors was entered into the company 's database • launching of a TV campaign on the company 's products ( tubes , safety doors , heating equipment ) In Spring 1997 ( TV network Τ@@ Ε@@ Τ ) .
this experiment assisted K@@ SE@@ P in acquiring the technology and promotion of possibilities of a new product among cus ­ tom@@ ers Introduction in K@@ SE@@ P of the technology for manufacturing specialised fit@@ tings for PVC tubes , not always available in Ukraine .
the Ukrainian furniture Industry has been particularly hit by the fall In the purchasing power of the population : furniture is one of the purchases which can be most easily post ­ p@@ oned .
for the lower end of the market , which is where Car@@ pat@@ y stands , the market is more reduced for eco ­ nom@@ ical reasons .
the result was that this raw material was markedly more exp@@ en ­ sive than the comparable product which could have been bought for cash , and also of a lower quality .
the management , however , did not consider the slump ¡ n sales as a durable trend , and did not take measures to cut or re @@@ -@@ @ assign production .
by the end of 1995 , the Invent@@ ories , instead of being a reservoir of future cash and a hedge against inflation , had become a financial burden for the com ­ p@@ any .
the purpose of this range is both to com ­ Pet@@ e in design and price with foreign or local products , and to reduce production costs through a better ration@@ alisation of the design and the production processes .
as mentioned above , the new product line also takes In@@ to account the need to ration@@ alise the basic components of the whole product range .
on the whole , the rise in the accounts recei@@ vable has been stopped , and they now stay at a reasonable level .
even more dangerous , however , was the production planning process based not on the expected sales , but on the need to keep the workforce busy .
more generally , the company is now recovering , after some deep changes , albeit at a reduced capacity , while most of the competing firms which do not have a foreign partner are now idle .
taking into account the depth of the changes this represents , the implementation of all those changes Is slower than it would be the case in a similar western European enterprise .
the economic consequences of the break @@@ -@@ @ up of the Soviet Union had catastrophic con ­ sequences for Soviet pharmaceutical producers , and Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in In particular .
but eight other of the top selling drugs experienced triple @@@ -@@ @ digit growth , and despite its apparent impressive growth , Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in was lagging behind .
the company only sel@@ ectively sells to a number of leading national and regional whole ­ sal@@ ers , and 55 % of sales revenues derive from Moscow @@@ -@@ @ based clients .
inflated manpower and inefficient labour productivity especially In indirect areas inherited from the company 's past as a producer of chemical substances may be significant co@@ st@@ cutting opportunities .
the Sales Division was created at the company based on the consultants ' recomm@@ enda ­ tions , with the new sales function and the order taking / logistics function organised as two separate units .
the new sales representatives were allocated to macro @@@ -@@ @ regional centres , from where they co @@@ -@@ @ ordin@@ ate company sales activities In surrounding Ob@@ lasts .
eventually , the company plans to split sales force efforts equally between wholes@@ al@@ ers vs. doctors and pharmacies .
the management of effective working relationships at national and regional levels is signi@@ fi ­ can@@ tly strengthening Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in 's position in the market and will contribute to a significant sales expansion .
Ak@@ ri@@ kh@@ in continues to pursue fulfilment of the jointly @@@ -@@ @ set goals , and a top level working group is regularly reviewing achievement under the strategic development program .
the project helped in clari@@ fying the company 's strategy and chann@@ elled management attention on a number of priority action programmes .
recent product introduc@@ tions , Ac@@ ic@@ lov@@ l@@ r @@@ -@@ @ Ak@@ ri ( zo@@ vi@@ ra@@ x generic equivalent ) and Bis@@ ep@@ to@@ l , contributed to the company 's high performance .
it was signed in June 1994 in Cor@@ fu by the Heads of State or Government of the Member States of the EU , the President of the European Commission and@@ the President of the Russian Federation .

the EU fav@@ ours the integration of a prosperous Russi@@ ain@@ to the global economic system and , in particular , Russia 's accession to the World Trade Organization .
it would be a clear@@ signal that old @@@ -@@ @ style state micro @@@ -@@ @ management of the economy has gone for good . it would cement Russia 's growing profile in the international economy .
in particular , within the WTO the EU played a key role in the drawing up of the Working Party Report on Russia 's accession , hence accelerating the accession process .
the majority of acc@@ eding countries are traditional economic partners of Russia , including in the trade field .
by the end of 2002 , the share of the euro had doubled and accounted for 20 % of the@@ total gold and forex reserves .
Russian citizens are increasingly looking at the euro as a stable and reliable currency in which they can store the value of their savings .
the European Union is committed to helping Russia in carrying out its economic reform process , notably by providing financial and technical support through the T@@ ac@@ is Programme .
since the laun@@ ch@@ of the Programme in 1991 , Russia has been allocated a total of € 2,@@ 6@@ 60 million in T@@ ac@@ is assistance .
the objectives are to mitigate the social costs of restructuring the economy , to reduce social disparities , and to improve the@@ delivery of primary municipal services .
nuclear safety is also the subject of a T@@ ac@@ is multi @@@ -@@ @ country programme , addressing the common problems of all the partner countries with nuclear installations on their territory .
it examines the EU 's relationship with the country and , on this basis , sets out priorities for T@@ ac@@ is support in a Country Strategy Paper .
on the basis of this strategy , the European Commission , in consultation with the Russian authorities , sets out the financial resources that can be allocated to address the priority objectives in great@@ er@@ detail , identifying potential partner institutions and setting objectives .
the next step is to move from the objectives of the Indic@@ ative Programme to a set of specific , detail@@ ed@@ projects matching those objectives .
in a typical T@@ ac@@ is project , a team of experts drawn from EU countries ( or future EU Member States ) works with the staff of a Russian partner organisation .
the establishment of pil@@ ot@@ projects in particular regions or institutions is often used as ame@@ ans of proving a methodology before encouraging others to@@ take it up .
T@@ AC@@ IS projects are carried out by con@@ sor@@ tia representing associations or organisations from different EU or Central European countries selected by the European Commission on the basis of a competi@@ tiv@@ et@@ ender .
non @@@ -@@ @ governmental organisations make a vital contribution to the promotion of th@@ es@@ e@@ principles and are the cornerstone of civil society .

after four successful enlarg@@ ements ( 1973 , 1981 , 1986 , 1995 ) , which increased the EU member@@ ship@@ from six to fifteen members , the European Union is now fin@@ al@@ ising its biggest enlargement ever .
however , what is fundamental to any@@ widening of the EU is that the nature of the EU@@ itself remains coherent and that its achievements in raising standards for its citizens are@@ not compromised .
simplification will benefit particularly Small and Medium @@@ -@@ @ sized Enterprises ( SMEs ) , for which the costs of compliance with trade procedures are proportion@@ ately higher .
Russia is well positioned to take advantage of EU enlargement also due to its geographical proxim@@ ity@@ to the several acc@@ eding countries experiencing strong economic growth .
since 1991 , the European Union has made a large financial commitment to Kaliningrad , providing roughly € 40 million directly under various sub @@@ -@@ @ allocations of the T@@ ac@@ is Programme .

an example of the type of initiative that works on this Europe dimension is the Europe - Russia - Europe exhibition that took place from May to July 2007 at the State Tre@@ ty@@ akov Gallery in Moscow .
a new programme to support EU Russia cultural cooperation initiatives was launched in 2007 through the Delegation of the European Commission to Russia .
introduction still deal with the legal and practical aspects of moving valuable art objects from one country to another .
ever increasing numbers of travellers are drawn to the cities and regions of Europe and Russia .
it is certainly true that a great deal of present day cultural , political and economic activity relies on the movement of art across international borders .
most countries have seen repeated revisions and amendments to the cultural heritage protection legislation to bring it into line with changing realities .
indeed , several countries surveyed for this publication revealed that the large majority of their EU lic@@ ences for temporary export were issued to museums and galleries .
exhibitions of more recent works of art and design might be covered by national legislation in some countries so it is always worth checking the regulations in such cases .
the financial value is that of the cultural object in the Member State referred to in Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Regulation .
this counter value in national currencies shall be reviewed every two years with effect from 31 December 2001 .
practice shows , however , that other Member States do not make such checks on a systematic basis .
the export licence must be shown at customs when the goods leave the customs territory of the EU .
chapter 2 : the Movement of Cultural Goods from and to@@ the European Union : the Legal Framework condition to the Community .
INTER@@ NAT@@ ION@@ AL@@ European Community legislation is applicable as explained in Chapter 2@@ UNESCO Convention of 1970 ( ratified by Bulgaria in 1971 )
if you are exporting cultural goods from Bulgaria to Russia which are covered by EU legislation ( see chapter 2 for the categories , values and age thresholds ) you will need an EU export licence .
whether you are applying for an EU export licence or for permission under national legislation , the same documents and procedures are used .
do museums and galleries need lic@@ ences for temporary exports ( e.g. a touring exhibition ) ? do non @@@ -@@ @ profit organisations need export lic@@ ences ?
when you leave Bulgaria , you must show the export permission and , if export is to a country outside the EU , you must also show the EU export licence .
standard lic@@ ences allow for the permanent or temporary export of a good , and can be used within 12 months of their delivery .
a Committee formed of experts from different government departments and NGOs does the valuation of the object .
the second type is " collections of museum character , " mostly objects kept in museums and galleries , and these enjoy a higher level of protection .
each covers a different geographical territory as well as having a specialist field of knowledge , depending on the type of object .
if you are not resident , you apply to the Speci@@ alist Organisation in the region where the object was located at the time of its acquisition .
the Ministry of Culture is entitled to apply penalties to breaches of the legislation by applying fines .
in 2005 the Commission made advance examinations of 34 sales catalo@@ gues comprising 18@@ ,@@ 5@@ 45 catalogue items . they made reservations in the case of seven objects .
the Cultural As@@ sets Commission has acquired around 90 cultural objects during 14 years of its work through this process . these can be viewed on the website under " As@@ sets . "
this festival is to become a regular event supported by the Russian Federal Agency for Culture and Cin@@ em@@ at@@ ography ( Ros@@ k@@ ul@@ tur@@ a ) and the governments and city councils in both countries .
you need to present the export licence together with the export declaration .
in March 2007 the Embassy of Finland together with its Russian partners organised a festival celebrating 100 years of Finnish parliament .
the EU export licence must be presented , in support of the export declaration , when the customs export form@@ alities are carried out .
the Bureau also acts as the Secretariat for the Consul@@ tative Commission on National Treas@@ ures , a body that gives opinions on
the certificate is valid indefinitely for goods over 100 years old and for other cultural goods it is valid for 20 years , on a renewable basis .
for the EU export licence application , you must submit valuation , expertise , invoice etc .
the Bureau contributes to the search for stolen art in liaison with the O@@ C@@ BC police authority responsible for the protection of cultural goods .
the authorities in each of the 16 Bundes@@ l@@ ä@@ n@@ der maintain a register of cultural objects of national importance - Ver@@ ze@@ ic@@ hn@@ is national wer@@ t@@ vol@@ len Kul@@ tur@@ g@@ utes .
if you are in any doubt , check the age and value of the cultural goods . this determines whether an EU export licence is required .
( as described in Chapter 2 ) . this applies whether the export is temporary , e.g. for a concert tour , or permanent .
given Greece 's cultural heritage , the primary emphasis of national legislation is on the protection of movable archaeological heritage .
cultural seasons in both countries from 2004 @@@ -@@ @ 2006 opened genuinely new chapters in the field of artistic relations between Hungary and Russia .
certain categories of goods , according to age and value thresholds , must have an EU export licence .
at present this covers paintings in the care of the National Gallery of Ireland and the Hugh Lan@@ e Municipal Gallery of Modern Art .
you must go through the application process with the Irish national authorities in order for the goods to be cleared for export .
both the EU and Irish national legislation have value and age thresholds which determine which cultural objects require export lic@@ ences .
the 1997 Act design@@ ates special conditions for cultural and archaeological objects which are on the National Register but not in the care of a national institution .
information on the protection of cultural goods and EU export lic@@ ences can be found at : http : / / www.@@ arts @@@ -@@ @ sport @@@ -@@ @ tour@@ is@@ m.@@ gov@@ .@@ ie / culture / schemes / cultural _ good@@ s.@@ html
under the Italian Code , works of art by living artists do not require permission ( in the form of a Certificate of Cir@@ cul@@ ation ) .
if this is lacking , a declaration must be provided with all the available information on the pro@@ ven@@ ance , attribu@@ tion and authenticity .
for cultural goods owned by private individuals or by organisations which are not public administrations or institutions , a security bond will be required for temporary export .
the object is subject to examination and within 15 days after this the Inspection takes a decision to permit or prohibit the export of the cultural object .
the applicant can appeal against the decision on the value / age / national importance of an object to the Ministry of Culture .

in 2003 Lithuania launched a long @@@ -@@ @ term cultural programme called " Window to Lithuania " to introduce Lithuanian culture and business to the regions of Russia .
the Lithuanian Archi@@ ves Department has the right to extend this period for up to 30 days , where the Commission of Experts is involved .
when issuing a permit for the export of anti@@ ques from Lithuania , the r@@ arity factor ( " the antique object is rare or in danger of becoming rare " ) will not apply where :
in this case , the antique object may , with the consent of the owner , be entered in the Register of Cultural Property or be purchased by the State .
for documents over 50 years old , a permit will not be issued where the Department determines that the absence of the documents would impover@@ ish the cultural heritage of Lithuania .
in the same manner have Luxembourg 's finest artists been keen to share their work with the Russian public .

inflation fell as they started preparing for the euro and , since its introduction , has remained around 2 % in the euro area . low and stable inflation benefits everyone .

independent states can integrate their economies to varying degrees in order to achieve the benefits of size , such as greater internal efficiency and more ro@@ bust@@ ness to external events .
these countries form the euro area and , as well as the single currency , have a single monetary policy conducted by the European Central Bank .
against this troubling background , and with the customs union largely achieved , the Community was anxious to set itself new goals for political development during the next decade .
a new proposal for EMU was put forward in 1977 by the then President of the European Commission , Roy Jen@@ kins .
the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the ECB , the EM@@ I began to coordinate monetary policy among the national central banks , which the Maastricht Treaty required to be independent , as well as working on the details of the single currency .
by that time , more than 6 billion bank@@ notes and close to 30 billion national coins had been withdrawn , and for over 300 million citizens in 12 countries the euro had finally arrived .
the operations and institutions of EMU were designed from the outset to support these objectives through the management of the monetary and economic aspects of the euro area .
the ECB and the central banks of all EU Member States form the European System of Central Banks ( ESC@@ B ) .
in this " Madrid scenario , " as it is called , a three @@@ -@@ @ year transitional period allows individuals and businesses to prepare for the single currency before it appears in their pockets .
the institutional framework for managing EMU has proved a clear success and reflects the strong commitment of the euro area Member States to cooperate on economic issues of " common concern . "
single countries , such as the United States and Japan , have a centr@@ alised monetary policy and a centr@@ alised fi fiscal policy operated by a single government .
since then , demand has grown continuously as the graph to the right shows ( the peaks in the growth are due to extra demand for bank@@ notes around the Christmas period ) :

this is better for my customers , as I have more opportunities to diversify their portfolios , without the currency exchange risk , and get better returns for them .

monitoring results are reported to the Commission at regular intervals and information on drinking water quality has to be made available to the public .
in a Syn@@ thesis Report on the quality of drinking water in the EU Member States in the period 1993 @@@ -@@ @ 95 , it was concluded that the general quality of drinking water supplied to European citizens had reached a high status .
the general objective of EU legislation on bathing water has been to ensure the good quality of bathing water , both freshwater and coastal water , over time .
the main issue in achieving this goal is the prevention of the pollution of bathing waters by sewage eff@@ lu@@ ents .
the 1976 Ba@@ thing Directive is one of the oldest pieces of environmental legislation in Europe .
with respect to industrial waste water , dis@@ charges into collecting systems and treatment plants are subject to prior regulation and / or specific author@@ isation , and subject to forms of specified pre @@@ -@@ @ treatment .
improved treatment of wastewater has resulted in improvement of the state of water bodies with a decrease in concentration of pollutants over the past ten years , although nit@@ rate pollution continues to be a problem in many regions .
in the Acc@@ ession Countries , decrease of wastewater pollution is due to the general increase in the level and extent of waste water treatment and to the recession associated with the transition to market @@@ -@@ @ oriented economies .
ph@@ asing proposed for the implementation of the nit@@ rates Directive is differentiated for the case of design@@ ating individual nit@@ rate vulnerable zones and for the case of applying action programmes throughout a national territory .
the overall purpose of the Water Framework Directive ( W@@ F@@ D ) is to establish a framework for the protection of European inland surface water , transitional waters , coastal waters and groundwater .
• Ap@@ pointing a central oversight body with river basin @@@ -@@ @ based subsidiary departments or institutions to organise and undertake day @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ day work in the river basins ; or

the Marine Strate@@ gies will contain a detailed assessment of the state of the environment , a definition of " good environmental status " at a regional level and the establishment of clear environmental targets and monitoring programmes .
in recognition of the ac@@ ut@@ eness of water scarcity and drought challenges in Europe , the Commission has recently taken steps to address these problems .
in July 2007 , a Communication on Water S@@ car@@ city and droughts was launched , based on a current assessment of the water scarcity problem .

different authorities may be responsible for different aspects of water policy , with water ministries dealing with water quantity and environmental ministries managing water quality . the Ministry of Health also sometimes monitors water quality .
it targets various areas of cooperation including sustainable development and the environment , supporting jointly agreed reform priorities in the EN@@ P Action Plans .
guided by the agreed priorities in the EN@@ P Action Plans , the EN@@ PI provides for assistance under national , regional , cross @@@ -@@ @ border and inter@@ regional programmes .
as a means of delivering technical assistance under the EN@@ P , the Technical Assistance and Information Exchange ( TA@@ IE@@ X ) instrument and long @@@ -@@ @ term tw@@ inning arrangements have been made available to the EN@@ P partner countries :

• Legislative considerations : framework @@@ -@@ @ type legislation , such as the Water Framework Directive , may be adopted at an early stage , as it provides the outline for other daughter legislation .
most , if not all , of the accession countries asked for - and received - transition periods in this sector .
cost estimates largely depended on the existing level of connection to the public se@@ wer system in the accession countries , and on the extent and intensity of treatment before implementation of the Directive .
in the N@@ MS@@ s , nit@@ rate pollution was less of a problem at the time of accession than in the intensely f@@ armed parts of the EU .
costs for implementing EU Direc@@ tives were estimated to be substantial , in particular in the case of the more investment @@@ -@@ @ heavy Direc@@ tives such as the U@@ WW@@ T@@ D .
however , large economic benefits in the range between 5 to 14 billion EUR were also predicted for the N@@ MS from compliance with EU legislation in the water sector .
with regard to institutions , the W@@ F@@ D requires management on the basis of river basins , as well as regional , national and transnational coordination between authorities , and inter @@@ -@@ @ agency coordination of activities .
furthermore , an effective implementation of the W@@ F@@ D requires a general legal system that protects access to environmental information , provides for environmental impact assessments , and supports the involvement of stakeholders .

in order to facilitate rational waste management , which takes into account the mass and composition of waste and the real needs of a community / region , the W@@ aste Framework Directive prescri@@ bes waste management planning .
the W@@ aste Shi@@ pment Regulation implementing the Basel Convention on the Control of Trans@@ boundary Mov@@ ements of Haz@@ ardous W@@ astes and their Dis@@ pos@@ al sets specific requirements and restrictions for the shipment of waste in other countries , including countries that are not part of the EU .
in order to attain a certain environmental level of waste treatment , convergence of the EN@@ P partner countries with the basic waste treatment Direc@@ tives , the Land@@ ll Directive and the W@@ aste incin@@ eration Directive is recommended .
this , however , would require the establishment of separate collection regimes managed by the producers of the respective goods or the state .
the Directive lays down the basic hierarchy of waste management and waste treatment and contains basic requirements for the waste treatment installations .

national waste law often attributes a monopoly to these public waste collection services for the collection and treatment of particular waste fr@@ actions , particularly when it comes to the disposal of household waste .
the cost of dispos@@ ing of waste must be borne by the holder who has waste handled by a collector or dispos@@ er ; and / or by the previous holder or the producer of the product from which the waste came .

waste authorities then have to develop a waste policy consisting of basic strategic choices and technical day @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ day management of the waste streams in the state .
in order to prepare and control the proper management of waste , these authorities have to acquire an overview of the quantities and qualities of the wastes produced in the states and have to devise options for waste collections and treatment .
chapters 6.2 @@@ -@@ @ 6.5 give an overview of the most common problems and how they could be addressed with help of drawing on the EU waste legislation .
a fundamental requirement for ecologically sound and socially acceptable waste management is the professional collection and treatment of waste produced in a local community to be organised by the public author@@ iti@@ es.@@ 31
the existence of uncontrolled land@@ fills has been identified as a core problem for most of the Eastern European and Mediterranean neighbours as well as Russia .
this shift would require a substantial investment into infrastructure , as well as trained personnel to inspect the land@@ fill sites and to ensure compliance of these land@@ fills with all standards .
it is of primary importance that the products of any recycling and recovery processes can be marketed and thus can contribute to a lowering of waste management costs .
therefore , policy makers should promote secondary product and energy from waste @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ energy installations to assure that they can be sold and used .
thus , public campaigns and public procurement should raise awareness of waste as a resource .
resources contained in the different waste streams are lost by " bur@@ ying " them in land@@ fills , often becoming polluted sites after their closure .

this Convention was adopted on 22 March 1989 by the 116 States participating in the Conference of Pl@@ enipot@@ enti@@ aries on the Global Convention on the Control of Trans@@ boundary Mov@@ ements of Haz@@ ardous W@@ astes .
an effective implementation of the requirements of the Basel Convention by the EN@@ P would very much help limit the un@@ desired imports of hazardous and other wastes into the Eastern and Mediterranean Partners as well as Russia .
it is obvious that it is neither realistic nor necessary to apply all EU waste legislation at once in the region of Eastern and Mediterranean Countries and Russia .

the recent historic enlargement of the EU in 2004 and 2007 contributed to the creation of a large zone of democracy and prosperity in Europe .
this " partnership for reform " is offered by the EU to 16 partner countries to the South and to the East of the EU@@ 1 .
the EN@@ P is not about membership of the EU - if an accession perspective were to be offered at some point in the future to any of the countries covered by the EN@@ P , this would be a separate process .
the EN@@ P Action Plans also provide a means of technical and financial support in the partner 's own reform efforts and modernisation .
the policy guide sets out the key principles and concepts of the relevant pieces of legislation and outlines the main policy instruments used within the EU .
convergence toward EU air quality legislation has the potential to bring a number of benefits to the EU 's European Neigh@@ bour@@ hood Policy ( EN@@ P ) partner countries .
in the EU , this piece of legislation ensures a collection of baseline data on ambient air quality and an improvement in their compatibility , compar@@ ability and transparency .
the Directive on E@@ missions from Light @@@ -@@ @ duty Vehic@@ les and the Directive Rel@@ ating to the Quality of Petro@@ l and Di@@ esel Fuel are highly relevant for the control of emissions from mobile sources .
this is of particular importance in the EU 's Eastern EN@@ P Partner Countries and Russia , where a large and increasing number of old cars are used .
accordingly , the Th@@ ematic Strategy on Air Poll@@ ution establishes interim objectives for air pollution in the EU and proposes appropriate measures for achieving them .
the directives are presented , focusing on the aim of a directive , its main principles and instruments as well as the benefits seen from the implementation of the directive .
under the National E@@ mission Ce@@ il@@ ings Directive the emission ceilings for the Member States are based on the principle of achieving the environmental objectives though cost @@@ -@@ @ effective measures , i.e. at the least cost for the European Community .
member States are required to inform the Commission about air quality issues in their territory and ( in more recent legislation ) to inform the public .
member States are required to provide up @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ date information to the public and appropriate organisations on ambient air concentrations of certain pollutants .
the Air Quality Framework Directive requires Member States to carry out a preliminary assessment of ambient air quality throughout their territories in order to obtain initial data on the levels of specified pollutants in the air .
to this end , the methods and criteria set out in the Dau@@ ghter Direc@@ tives may be used or methods for which Member States can demonstrate that they give equivalent results .
member States shall prepare action plans indicating the measures to be taken in the short term to reduce pollution , in the event there is a risk of the limit values and / or alert thresholds being exceeded .
with the Exchange of Information Decision ( 97 / 101 / EC ) the European Union has established a Comm@@ u @@@ -@@ @ nity @@@ -@@ @ wide procedure for exchanging information and data on ambient air quality in the EU .
update annually their national emission inventories and emission projections for 2010 with the use of EM@@ EP / Cor@@ in@@ air E@@ mission Invent@@ ory Gu@@ ide@@ book@@ .The inventories shall be prepared using methodologies agreed upon by the L@@ RT@@ AP Convention .
draw up a national programme for the progressive reduction of the national emissions in order to demonstrate how they are going to meet the national emission ceilings by 2010 .
the second national programmes - by the end of 2006 . ( examples of the measures taken by Member States under the NE@@ C Directive are provided in Box 5 ) .
the IP@@ PC Directive is important to achieve the NE@@ C Directive 's ceil@@ - ings as it addresses all four pollutants .
another key directive influencing the NE@@ C Directive is the L@@ CP Direc@@ - tive , reported by Member States as a measure for reducing NO and SO
the NE@@ C Directive is used as the EU instrument for the implementation of the " multi @@@ -@@ @ pollut@@ ant " protocol under the L@@ RT@@ AP Convention , the so @@@ -@@ @ called 1999 Go@@ th@@ enburg Protocol .
the L@@ CP Directive applies to large combustion plants with a thermal input of 50 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts ( MW ) or more , irrespective of the type of fuel that is used .
the Directive oblig@@ es Member States to take appropriate measures to meet the emission limit values for " new " and " new @@@ -@@ @ new " plants as laid down in part A and B accordingly of Ann@@ exes III to VII .
the first requires each plant to comply with specified emission limit values for SO
X sion limit values to the existing plants in operation in the year 2000 , on the basis of each plant 's operational performance averaged over the last five years of operation up to and including 2000 .
the implementation of a national emission reduction plan has to take into account obligations under other Community legislation , notably the IP@@ PC Directive , the NE@@ C Directive , and the Air Quality Framework Directive .
for vehicles in use there is legislation on periodic inspections at which the state of maintenance of the vehicle is checked ( Directive 96 / 96 / EC ) .
motor vehicle emissions have originally been regulated by Directive 70 / 220 / E@@ EC ( light @@@ -@@ @ duty vehicles ) and 88 / 77 / EC ( heavy @@@ -@@ @ duty vehicles ) and amendments to those directives .
member States may also apply tax incentives for vehicles fulfilling more stringent standards , which satisfy at the same time the limit values of the Directive .
since 1 January 2005 the limit on the sulphur content of petrol and diesel is 50 pp@@ m and Member States are required to start ph@@ asing in ultra @@@ -@@ @ low sulphur fuel with maximum 10 pp@@ m sulphur content .
based on the Commission assessments , achieving the objectives set will only be possible with the full application of Best Available Tech@@ ni@@ ques ( b@@ ats ) by industry .
it strengthens the application of b@@ ats across the EU , particularly by restricting divergence from b@@ ats to specific cases and placing greater emphasis on justi@@ fying the conditions laid down in the permits .
the proposal also extends the scope of legislation to cover other poll@@ uting activities , such as medium sized combustion plants ( between 20 and 50 MW ) , production of wood @@@ -@@ @ based panels and preservation of wood .
in general , the ambient air quality in these countries has improved in recent decades as a consequence of the sharp decrease in air emissions due to the dramatic fall in industrial production following the collapse of the Soviet Union .
in general , air pollution affects these countries '@@ major cities and stems from transport rather than industrial emissions .
it targets various areas of cooperation including sustainable development and the environment , supporting jointly agreed reform priorities in the EN@@ P Action Plans .
guided by the agreed priorities in the EN@@ P Action Plans , the EN@@ PI provides for assistance under national , regional , cross @@@ -@@ @ border and inter@@ regional programmes .
as a means of delivering technical assistance under the EN@@ P , the Technical Assistance and Information Exchange ( TA@@ IE@@ X ) instrument and long @@@ -@@ @ term tw@@ inning arrangements have been made available to the EN@@ P partner countries :
it is therefore necessary to assess realistically what is achievable on the basis of the existing air quality management system and the institutional set @@@ -@@ @ up in each country .
legislative considerations . within the air quality sector , implementation of the Air Quality Framework Directive must be given a high priority , as this provides the structure and foundation for daughter legislation .
planning should be carried out as a first priority in any areas where air quality needs to be improved , i.e. where prescribed limit values are exceeded .
in this context , it may be helpful to review existing policies for charging and pricing , and to assess whether they may be amended or new systems should be introduced , in order to raise the necessary funds .
compliance with emission limits and technical requirements required under the directives , or by the implementation of plans and programmes designed to improve ambient air quality .
• Using the strategic and financial planning as a basis , an implementation plan should be developed detail@@ ing the steps necessary to implement convergence according to the priorities and objectives identified in the earlier planning phases .

furthermore , lack of information prevents citizens from making important choices based on the given information . lack of information also h@@ inders participation in decision @@@ -@@ @ making , as only informed citizens can take action in an appropriate way .

the Directive for providing for public participation in respect of E@@ IA ( 2003 / 35 ) , enhances transparency and increase legitimacy of plans , programmes , and individual projects .
EN@@ P countries may face barriers to receiving development aid if their environmental impact assessment systems are deemed inadequate by the donor agency .
through the examination of potential environmental impacts , the developers were able to identify their chosen design , which was to build a new motorway , and to mitigate negative environmental impacts .
furthermore , by identifying and choosing an alternative that does not result in additional environmental impacts , the project proposal received no complaints and the project was able to avoid delays .
in order to alleviate the growing waste problem and enhance their management plans , an SE@@ A was undertaken , with the goal of solving their problem by 2010 .
public authorities hold data and information on a wide range of environmental matters that have often been collected over long periods in order to carry out their various legal responsibilities .
the envisaged grounds for refusal have to be interpreted in a restrictive way , taking into account for the particular case the public interest served by disclosure .
to this end reports the Commission provides a relevant questionnaire or outline on which the reports should be based .
the idea of environmental impact assessments is based on the precautionary principle and the principle that prevent@@ ative action should be taken ( Box 4 ) .
on the other hand , individual projects refer to a concrete project within such strategy or land use plans , such as the building of an airport or the construction of a new highway .
implementation of the E@@ IA Directive has also to take into account the requirements of the Directive for providing for public participation in respect of E@@ IA [ 2003 / 35 / EC ] ( see Chapter 4.4 ) .
they are to be assessed : during the decision @@@ -@@ @ making process , before the plans or programmes are adopted , with the aim of improving the plan from a sustainable development point of view .
screening : since the Directive does not give a one @@@ -@@ @ stop definition of plans and programmes , the given country first has to determine the types of plans and programmes that will be subjected to SE@@ As .
this includes the identification of the physical / regional limits , the impacts to be addressed and the alternative actions that need to be assessed .
most Eastern EN@@ P partner countries have ratified the Aar@@ h@@ us Convention but lack of resources at regional and local levels make it hard to follow the Convention 's requirements .

as a means of delivering technical assistance under the EN@@ P , the Technical Assistance and Information Exchange ( TA@@ IE@@ X ) instrument and long @@@ -@@ @ term tw@@ inning arrangements have been made available to the EN@@ P partner countries :
apart from the participation requirements as established by the Direc@@ tives , stakeholder involvement should be ensured in all stages of implementation .
furthermore , it is vital to set up a clear division with respect to which level of government is responsible in order to avoid double work and unnecessary use of funds .
it should be realistically assessed to what extent the EN@@ P partner country can align with the EU Direc@@ tives and in what areas convergence can bring the greatest benefits .
the following gives a short impression of the major types of costs related to the horizontal Direc@@ tives :
in case of the E@@ IA and SE@@ A Direc@@ tives , costs are expected to be significant in particular in countries currently re@@ organising their administrative structures from a centr@@ alised to a decentr@@ alised system .
on the basis of the strategic and financial planning , an implementation plan should be developed detail@@ ing the steps necessary to implement convergence according to the priorities and objectives identified in the earlier planning phases .
implementation plans should allow sufficient time to give all actors and stakeholders affected time to adjust to the changes and make the necessary investments .
however , the situation in the EN@@ P partner countries is quite different to that in the Member States and the usefulness of reference to Member States therefore limited .
it may be concluded that the time given to the new Member States for implementation can serve as guidance .

loss of biodiversity : the main concern is the loss of biodiversity in ecosystems at the species and gene levels .
the vast majority of European habitats have been shaped and managed by people for millennia , resulting in a unique mosaic of natural and semi @@@ -@@ @ natural habitats .
the European Union has been involved in efforts to protect the continent 's heritage for the past 30 years .
in order to speed up the move towards the overall goal of hal@@ ting the loss of biodiversity by 2010 , the Commission issued in 2006 a Communication " hal@@ ting the loss of Bio@@ diversity by 2010 - and Bey@@ ond .
the following box gives an overview of environmental and socio @@@ -@@ @ economic benefits that can be achieved by implementing the Hab@@ it@@ ats Directive .
good signs of commitment to the conservation of biodiversity by European countries are shown by the increase in the total surface cover of nationally @@@ -@@ @ designated areas over time .
an exceptional example of this is the Hungarian P@@ us@@ z@@ ta , a semi @@@ -@@ @ natural grass@@ land ecosystem which stretches between the Alpine and Carpath@@ ian mountain ranges , that is the result of centuries of extensive gra@@ zing by Hungarian grey cattle and sheep .
in Denmark , access and proximity to the site supports local people 's quality of life as well as attracting new inhabitants to the area .
the objective of the Directive is to provide for the protection , management and control of naturally occurring wild birds and their ne@@ sts , eggs and habitats , as well as to regulate the exploitation of these species within the European Union .
all globally threatened bird species occurring in the EU @@@ -@@ @ 25 are now protected either under the Bir@@ ds Directive .
for EU Member States , Emer@@ ald Net@@ work@@ 26 sites are those of the Nat@@ ura 2000 network , established through the Hab@@ it@@ ats Directive .

from 1996 to 1999 , the Commission carried out a Dem@@ on@@ stration Programme on IC@@ Z@@ M with the purpose of collecting technical information and stimulating a debate among different stakeholders on coastal zone management .

moreover , there exists a Commun@@ ic@@ ation@@ 28 on a Strategy for integrating environmental protection con@@ sid@@ - er@@ ations into the CF@@ P , produced by the Commission .
environmental policies of the Eastern EN@@ P partner countries have been formulated through a number of national strategies , legislation and policy statements .
these include the developed Framework of the Euro @@@ -@@ @ Mediterranean partnership , the Short and Medium @@@ -@@ @ Term Pri@@ ority Environmental Action Programme ( SM@@ AP ) 32 and the Mediterranean Action Plan ( UNEP / M@@ AP ) .
it targets various areas of cooperation including sustainable development and the environment , supporting jointly agreed reform priorities in the EN@@ P Action Plans .
guided by the agreed priorities in the EN@@ P Action Plans , the EN@@ PI provides for assistance under national , regional , cross @@@ -@@ @ border and inter@@ regional programmes .
as a means of delivering technical assistance under the EN@@ P , the Technical Assistance and Information Exchange ( TA@@ IE@@ X ) instrument and long @@@ -@@ @ term tw@@ inning arrangements have been made available to the EN@@ P partner countries :
as for the Eastern EN@@ P partner countries and Russia , movement toward the environmental acqu@@ is in the area of nature protection will be challenging for the Mediterranean EN@@ P partner countries .
in this context , an informed dialogue and debate is required to increase confidence in site designation , to reduce resistance and concern and to increase collaboration between individual stakeholders .
some EN@@ P partner countries need to strengthen their environmental legislation or even to develop a new nature protection law in order to tran@@ sp@@ ose the selected requirements of the Direc@@ tives into national legislation .
in some countries administrative and institutional reform and / or capacity building will be necessary in order to successfully adopt Nature Protection legislation that conver@@ ges toward EU Direc@@ tives .
future management of protected areas requires the establishment of competent authorities for nature conservation at regional or local level .

however , the IP@@ PC Directive contains elements of flexibility by allowing the licensing authorities , in determining permit conditions , to take into account the technical characteristics of the installation , its geographical location and the local environmental conditions .
the public must also be informed of the final decision and the results of the monitoring of releases .
industrial emissions are one of the main sources of environmental pollution ; therefore , the European Union has decided to apply a two @@@ -@@ @ fold approach to tackle this problem .
the IP@@ PC Directive requires that industrial installations be based on best available techniques ( B@@ AT ) , the legal definition of the term is as follows :
technique includes both the technology used and the way in which the installation is designed , built , maintained , operated and decom@@ mis@@ sioned .
for indication as to what is to be regarded as " best available techniques , " a European information exchange process , the so @@@ -@@ @ called Seville Process was created .
as a result , EU Member States that are technologically more advanced will be able to influence the description of B@@ AT in the B@@ RE@@ Fs in their favour .
hence , in these states the permitting authorities have to comply with national law , which is supposed to reflect what B@@ AT is for the different industrial installations .
in the event that B@@ RE@@ Fs or advanced drafts existed at the time of the adoption of the German general binding rules , their information was taken into account in determining the emission control requirements .
for existing installations , those installations that were put into operation or permitted before the implementation of the Direc@@ tiv@@ e@@ 16 , full compliance with the Directive is required by 30 October 2007 .
the Decision of the European Commission on the implementation of a European pollut@@ ant E@@ mission Register ( EP@@ ER ) solidi@@ fies the obligations laid down in Ar@@ t. 15 ( 3 ) IP@@ PC Directive .
as successor of the EP@@ ER , the European pollut@@ ant Release and Transfer Register ( European PR@@ TR ) has been created by Regulation ( EC ) No 166 / 2006 , adopted on 18 January 2006 .
the collection of emissions data by the Member States enables the Member States and the European Commission to identify the most polluted industrial sites in the respective Member States and allows the permitting authorities to set priorities in their monitoring and inspection activities .
since industrial installations in the East European EN@@ P partners and Russia often date from Soviet times , in many cases the technology is outdated .
189@@ .@@ See Report for D@@ G Environment , Support to D@@ G Environment for the development of the Mediterranean De @@@ -@@ @ pollution Initiative " Hor@@ iz@@ on 2020 , " p . 50 .
the EU 's Eastern EN@@ P partners are comprised of Belar@@ us@@ 23 , Moldova , Ukraine , as well as Georgia , Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus .
although the countries in Eastern Europe feature environmental laws that form a framework for the permitting procedure for industrial installations , there is no requirement to employ B@@ AT to operate industrial installations .
it targets various areas of cooperation including sustainable development and the environment , supporting jointly agreed reform priorities in the EN@@ P Action Plans .
guided by the agreed priorities in the EN@@ P Action Plans , the EN@@ PI provides for assistance under national , regional , cross @@@ -@@ @ border and inter@@ regional programmes .
as a means of delivering technical assistance under the EN@@ P , the Technical Assistance and Information Exchange ( TA@@ IE@@ X ) instrument and long @@@ -@@ @ term tw@@ inning arrangements have been made available to the EN@@ P partner countries :
the permit must set conditions in a holistic way and take into account all possible environmental effects that could be caused by the industrial installation in question .
in order to be effective , the permitting authorities must strictly enforce the requirements laid down by the national permitting laws .
in order to achieve a sophisticated technological level and to enhance environmental protection , the EN@@ P partners could engage - similar to the EU - in their own information exchange process among themselves to determine the B@@ AT in the region .
this process will require a significant organisational effort by the different countries to analyse the best available technologies available in their territory and / or affordable for their industry .
moreover , the observation of the development of the B@@ RE@@ Fs ( i.e. the foreseen " updates " of the B@@ RE@@ Fs every three years ) by the neighbouring countries could be a useful strategy to pursue this aim .
in order to achieve transparency and to inform the population about the current emission levels in the different regions and loc@@ alities , the Eastern and Mediterranean countries could institute an instrument mod@@ elled on the EP@@ ER or E @@@ -@@ @ PR@@ TR@@ .@@ 29
there is considerable scientific evidence that beyond this threshold irreversible and potentially catastrophic changes could occur .
they are almost certainly the international community 's last chance to prevent climate change from reaching dangerous levels .
the growing evidence of the cost of climate change points to one simple conclusion : we C@@ AN@@ NOT afford to do nothing .
it has succeeded in putting in place a set of international rules , market @@@ -@@ @ based mechanisms and funds for addressing climate change .
the shift towards a low @@@ -@@ @ carbon global economy is a huge opportunity for business , especially in terms of technological innovation , which can drive economic growth and the creation of new jobs .
what is needed now is support from major em@@ it@@ ters for a global climate agreement to ensure the deployment and further development of these technologies .
at the same time , EU leaders committed to transforming Europe into a highly energy @@@ -@@ @ efficient , low @@@ -@@ @ carbon economy .
the package also sets out sustainability criteria that biofuels must meet to ensure they deliver real environmental benef@@ it@@ s. ts .

besides helping to avert the most damaging impacts of global climate change , reducing greenhouse gas emissions will bring the EU a range of co @@@ -@@ @ benefits .
these include improving energy security , reducing air pollution and its associated health and control costs , and increasing employment .
there is thus a very strong economic case for making more efficient use of resources , as a contribution towards improving EU competitiveness , even before the associated benefits of cutting emissions are taken into consideration .
in a competitive global market , every country needs to have the confidence that others are playing fair and living up to their pledges .
systems similar to that of the EU E@@ TS will be a key tool in enabling developed countries to meet their future commitments cost @@@ -@@ @ effectively .
just as measures to combat climate change will benefit Europe , they are also in the long @@@ -@@ @ term interest of less wealthy countries .
since vulnerable populations are the first to suffer the impact of floods , storms , droughts and the other effects of climate change , developing countries have every interest in joining the global effor@@ t. ort .
since power plants remain in use for several decades , it is vital that they make use of state @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ the @@@ -@@ @ art clean technologies that will minimise emissions .
targets for sectors covered would be strengthened gradually until they were similar to those set for the same sectors in developed countries .

for effective development of@@ new genetic tests and diagnostics , a productive inter@@ change between academic scientists and@@ those working in the healthcare industry will continue to be essential .
that : A. the European Union stimulates and supports partnerships bet@@ we@@ en@@ stakeholders ; b@@ . a framework for transparent collaboration between industry and academ@@ ic@@ scientists be established .
furthermore , their use should be permitted , when made anonymous , for research , development of genetic tests , and for teaching purposes . see report , chapter 4.1 .
for T@@ ac@@ is , In particular , encouraging cross@@ border and regional cooperation is a relatively new priority In addition to its classical role as an Instr@@ ument In support of the process of transition In the Commonwealth of Independent States .
at the wider regional level ( I.@@ e. the Baltic region ) , there is a need to promote Inter@@ state and Inter@@ regional cooperation with a view to assisting the development of the Northern Dimen@@ sion and moving towards enlargement .
for example , one of the criteria for the selection of T@@ ac@@ is C@@ BC projects is the existence of a complementary INTER@@ RE@@ G project on the other side of the border .
as described below , transnational co operation has a wider scope than cross@@ border co operation and is more suited to the maritime dimension of the Baltic Sea area .
the document ¡ s a discussion paper In@@ tended to encourage thinking on how to assist the development of the region In the framework of enhanced cooperation between Russia and the European Union .
the funding for INTER@@ RE@@ G III ( the latest phase of INTER@@ RE@@ G ) comes from the European Regional Development Fund , one of the Struc@@ tural Fun@@ ds .
transnational cooperation seeks to promote wider scale cooperation across national frontiers and as such It is not limited to con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous border areas .
following negotiation between the European Commission and the Member States and the part ­ nership , the programmes are approved by the Commission .
in the North Cal@@ ot@@ te / Kol@@ arc@@ tic INTER@@ RE@@ G M@@ IA programme ( € 47 million ) , the Kol@@ arc@@ tl@@ c part of the programme focuses on co ­ operation with Russia ( the Nord@@ kal@@ ot@@ ten part dealing with ¡ n@@ tra ­ Scandinavian co ­ operation . )
an analysis will be made to reconsider the ranking of border cross@@ ings for which available support can be most appropriately used to improve traffic flows .
although the T@@ ac@@ is C@@ BC programme Is the T@@ ac@@ is programme which can most obviously benefit from Im@@ proved coordination with INTER@@ RE@@ G , It is not the only one .
project proposals are submitted directly to the Europe@@ Aid service of the European Commission , which then selects the best projects once a year .
the Commission under@@ lines that , although the improvements it Is putting In place will Im@@ prove the possibilities of coordination between INTER@@ RE@@ G and T@@ AD@@ S , the actual coordination It@@ self must come from project applicants .
the Commission can set up a framework and encourage cooperation - only the authorities and organisations on the ground can actually ensure that the coordination leads to concrete results .
the secretariat Is the contact point for the programme . it deals with the practical arrangements of the programme , such as receiving and assessing projects .
in the case of INTER@@ RE@@ G @@@ -@@ @ T@@ ac@@ ls co @@@ -@@ @ ordination , project proposals will have to describe the links they have with a parallel T@@ AD@@ S project .
the most suitable project proposals will be select ed by a Steering Committee , which consists of representatives of the national , regional and local authorities and other organisations .
conditional approval could also be used where a project 's parallel application under T@@ AD@@ S had not yet been approved .
the Centre 's meetings , which aim to transfer EU experience to Russian partners , are also organised at industrial sites , such as in power stations within the EU .
the Moscow @@@ -@@ @ based Centre is jointly funded and managed by the European Commission 's Directorate @@@ -@@ @ General for Energy and Transport and the Russian Ministry of Ind@@ us ­ try and Energy .
the break @@@ -@@ @ up of the RAO unified energy system of Russia monopoly in electricity generation and distribution p@@ aves the way for new players to enter the market in Russia .
moreover , with the EU creating an integrated market for electricity , there is growing political demand to study ways of inter@@ connecting the separate electricity networks of Russia , other CIS countries , the Baltic States and other EU Member States .
implementation of such measures will facilitate the spread of internal market principles in the field of transport to@@ countries neighbouring the European Union .
this range of measures , ambitious but achievable , will give new impetus to economic integration between the European Union and its neighbours .

international anti @@@ -@@ @ mine action helps to promote global peace and stability and lessen human suffering in@@ mine @@@ -@@ @ affected regions .
it continues to be a top priority for the European Union , which contributed 40 million to this effort in the years 2000 @@@ -@@ @ 2002 alone .
but it also employs new@@ tools provided by the ES@@ DP such as gathering information and monitoring international agreements to anticipate potential conflicts .
this is essential in@@ enabling countries to integrate into the@@ global economy and achieve sustainable growth and development .
the transatlantic partnership with the United States is central to the EU 's external relations .
the European Uni@@ on@@ already has association agreements ( including free trade arrangements ) with Mexico and Chile , which wer@@ e@@ signed in 1997 and 2002 respectively .

the aim of the European Higher Education Area is to provide citizens with choices from a wide and transparent range of high quality courses , with the benefit of smoo@@ ther recognition procedures too .

in particular , Europe 's universities must face the challenges of globalisation , and reforms are needed to release their full potential to help create more growth and jobs and make Europe 's knowledge @@@ -@@ @ based society a reality .
the Regulation clearly design@@ ates the role of the Member States , EF@@ SA and the Commission in the setting of M@@ R@@ Ls and contains :
when there is a risk established for any consumer group , the M@@ R@@ L application will be rejected and the pesti@@ cide may not be used on that crop .
in such cases the M@@ R@@ L is set at the lower level , thus ensuring that only the necessary ( minimum ) amount of pesti@@ cide is used .
to ensure that this is done in an adequate and uniform way , the Commission has three instruments :
in 2006 , the European Commission proposed a strategy to improve the way pesticides are used across the EU .
it is intended for information purposes only and does not constitute official guidance from the Commission on the interpretation of EU laws or policies .
the authorities in every country dealing with S@@ IS II are obliged to check the quality of the information to be included in this system .
a key priority of the European Union is to build a strong strategic partnership with Russia based on a solid foundation of mutual respect .
Russia and the EU Member States are all members of the United Nations , the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) and the Council of Europe .
they are all committed to upholding and respecting the fundamental values and principles of democracy , human rights , the rule of law and the market economy .
these values underpin the EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia bilateral relationship and its legal basis , the Partnership and Cooperation European AG@@ S ying in front of St. B@@ asil 's Cathedral on Agreement .
the EU and Russia are already cooperating in many ways , including the modernisation of Russia 's economy and its integration into the world economy , security , international issues and cooperation in the common neighbourhood of Eastern Europe .
it sets the principal common objectives , establishes the institutional framework for bilateral contacts , and calls for activities and dialogue in a number of areas .
• At Ministerial level in the Permanent Partnership Council ( P@@ PC ) , to allow Ministers responsible for various policy areas to meet as often as necessary and to discuss SP@@ E @@@ -@@ @ CI c issues .
• Between the European Parliament and the Russian Parliament ( State Duma and Federation Council ) in the EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee .
to complement the provisions of the PC@@ A , a number of sectoral and international agreements exist , as well as other mechanisms for cooperation ( see section below ) .
• In November 2002 , recogn@@ ising the great efforts that Russia has made in its transition to a fully @@@ -@@ @ fledged market economy , the EU granted " market economy status " to Russian exporters .
the EU is currently working with Russia on a new agreement for post @@@ -@@ @ 2007 to replace the existing Partnership and Cooperation Agreement ( PC@@ A ) .
the aim of the new agreement will be to provide a durable and comprehensive framework for EU @@@ -@@ @ Russia relations based on respect for common values and will provide the basis for the relationship in the coming years .
the Moscow Summit in May 2005 adopted Road Maps to act as the short and medi@@ um@@ term instruments for the implementation of the four Common Sp@@ aces .

• Does the author ( s ) reveal his / her view point ( s ) and discuss how his / her view point ( s ) may affect the study ?
as mentioned before , an appraisal of the data quality for the indicators is of crucial importance .
mixed methods sampling strategies involve the selection of units for a research study using both probability sampling ( to increase external validity ) and pur@@ posi@@ ve sampling strategies ( to increase transfer@@ ability ) .
ultimately , producing and disseminating outputs underpin the N@@ DO 's existence , as its outputs substanti@@ ate its visibility both nationally and internationally .
they need highly summar@@ ised , objective information on the national drugs situation in an international context and on drugs @@@ -@@ @ related issues of national interest .
the same approach can be used at the end of the process , to check if the fi nal product matches the format and content needs identified in the matrix .
information covering a wide range of technical and methodological issues , structured and well documented contents , in a not @@@ -@@ @ too @@@ -@@ @ detailed format ( for instance , review of literature , analysis of a compilation of documents ) .
summar@@ ised information on topics of general interest , allowing the audience to gain some insight into changes in the drugs situation and above all about the responses that may be relevant to their needs .
within the limits of its mandate , the N@@ DO needs to explore how it can make its work and products more useful and more relevant for its national audience .
• Be prospective : on the basis of the available information , try to identify what are the ongoing challenges and perspectives , or new risks
there are , however , some important differences between reporting systems , related to the purpose of the exercise , the procedures followed for data collection , and the role of the main actors .
for more than three decades this information had been collected annually through the Annual Reports Ques@@ tion@@ naires ( AR@@ Q ) and it had been regularly reported to the CN@@ D ( ... ) . " ( 3 ) .
the information used for evaluation is obtained from country responses to 50 indicators that comprise the ME@@ M Instr@@ ument in the form of a questionnaire ( 5 ) .
the next step is to consider whether the N@@ DO 's mandate allows direct communication with s t the media , or not .
however , in the 21 century , communication C@@ AN@@ NOT be reduced to whether this happens with or without the media .
institutional issues are only one of the challenges faced by an N@@ DO : the core operations are what give the substance and legitimacy of the work of national drugs observatories .
to make a strategic diagnosis , we must analyse the N@@ DO 's situation by describing the strengths and the weaknesses in terms of each K@@ SF , using specific criteria to cover a broad range of topics / issues .
• to ensure its sustainability , the N@@ DO must answer the needs of various audiences at different levels , who either play or could play a role in providing extra resources ( perceived added value )
• the value of the N@@ DO 's work is not always measurable - it depends on the perception of those who receive its products and outputs ;
• the value of the N@@ DO 's work must be assessed taking into account that a national need is not necessarily perceived as such by all institutions and individuals ;
" we are collecting factual , objective , comparable and reliable information on the drugs situation ... "
note : an " elevator pitch " ( or elevator speech ) is an overview of an idea for a product , service , or project .
is the general image of N@@ DO 's publications more of a scientific authority or is it perceived as being influenced by political or ideological considerations ?
is the N@@ DO considered as the main or one of the main references for drug @@@ -@@ @ related information in the country ?
is the N@@ DO trying to address the needs of national " clients , " even if its main aim is to produce a national report for an international organisation ?
in fact , in many cases , most of the N@@ DO 's products are the result of partnerships and cooperation , and external expertise may be needed also to validate its analyses and reports .
to support assessing the N@@ DO 's situation in terms of co @@@ -@@ @ production , we propose considering three categories of criteria for diagnosis : operating framework , reporting procedures and outputs .
content : do contents of reports and other publications reflect the need for a multi@@ disciplinary and multi@@ faceted approach in relation to the drugs phenomenon , or in most cases do they focus on one part of the problem ?
is the N@@ DO playing a role in the exploitation and promotion of existing resources at local and at national level ?
however , those contacted for funds need to see why they should give money to an N@@ DO instead of something else .
does the N@@ DO have a clear organisational status , is it recognised as a specific entity , and does it have a clear mandate for sharing and requesting data and information from other institutions and organisations ?
is the mission and work of the N@@ DO described in a yearly work programme with staff assigned exclusively to the N@@ DO on a full @@@ -@@ @ time basis ?
• to improve and to diversify the co @@@ -@@ @ production scheme so as to produce better products which are tailored to the needs of its different client groups ;
the analytical framework proposed is dynamic and flexible : there is no single model for ND@@ Os that should be applied in@@ distinctly to any country and to any situation .
what matters is establishing a system that can produce quality reports at an affordable cost and within a reasonable time frame , in a language and with conclusions that are easy to understand by its clients .
however , if too close politically , the N@@ DO 's scientific credibility and objectivity and even long @@@ -@@ @ term stability may be challenged .
• limiting the scope of the N@@ DO 's work to illicit drugs , for instance to remain consistent with the scope of the work of supranational and international organisations such the EM@@ CD@@ DA and UNO@@ DC ;
if the N@@ DO 's scope is extended to lic@@ it substances , this gives an excellent opportunity to build a comprehensive image of complex social and individual behavi@@ ours linked to addiction .
in all situations , the resources that the N@@ DO is allocated to do its job must be consistent with the scope of its mandate .
• The technical and scientific know @@@ -@@ @ how of the N@@ DO and partners should be developed as part of a permanent improvement of its scientific capacity ;
• Each country should find the structure and organisation that matches best with supranational and international reporting tasks and the national context ;
in such conditions , an observ@@ atory can work if some or part of the core functions are taken on by key external partners ( e.g. a university ) , with the N@@ DO coordinating the processes that are extern@@ alised .
if the N@@ DO is a rather small unit , this should be compensated with formal agreements for the second@@ ment of the missing scientific resources .
1 number of staff falls under three full @@@ -@@ @ time posts or their equivalent (
in order to provide policymakers with a comprehensive picture of the budgetary and financial implications involved in setting up an N@@ DO , the national drugs observ@@ atory and national drugs information network must be considered together .
• In some cases it may be relevant to make a distinction between costs for national and international obligations ;
• The funding issue does not end with the successful search for budgets - it is closely linked to the N@@ DO 's capacity to deliver outputs and be accountable for the use of funds .
if the N@@ DO is or tries to be too independent , it may end up in a situation where it is completely isolated and fails to receive the institutional and financial support it needs to perform its tasks .
• there should be an official request addressed to the N@@ DO by its national authority , indicating the scope and the objectives of the evaluation ;
when the scope of the work carried out by the N@@ DO within the evaluation is clearly limited , this gives more chances for the results to be accepted without damaging the N@@ DO .
this is why all of the N@@ DO 's actions linked to any evaluation must be scientifically sound and well documented .
as you start on this process , we invite you to take a different look at the context you work and live in .
looking back at this long process , there seemed to be a need to form@@ alise the experiences in the field , and to identify some key concepts and principles that remain valid irrespective of country or region .

sustainable consumption and production is broadly defined as a holistic approach to minim@@ ising environmental impacts and maxim@@ ising social benefits related to production and consumption .
this has been characterised by the increasing export of raw materials from a number of resource @@@ -@@ @ rich EECCA countries and a greater import of manufactured goods from other parts of the world .
in all countries of the region , household consumption expenditure exceeds government expenditure by a significant margin but remains far lower than consumption expenditure in the EU .
while this has had a positive impact on the standard of living , it is also likely to have resulted in an overall rise in environmental impacts from household consumption .
economic recovery since the late 1990s has increased access to food for many households and consumption of almost all food groups has been growing steadily .
agriculture accounts for most of the environmental impacts of the food production and consumption cycle .
yet strong challenges remain for the development of organic farming . organic certification schemes still need to be adopted in most of EECCA .
economic recovery , with its increased levels of production and import and export of goods , is a key factor behind the growing transport activity .
total waste generation in EECCA and SE@@ E countries is high , mostly because of large @@@ -@@ @ scale resource extraction and processing .
the ongoing economic and social restructuring in the region provides a unique opportunity to establish more resource @@@ -@@ @ efficient , safe and sustainable production patterns and , at the same time , improve the quality of life .
it provides detailed information and analysis of key thematic issues from an SC@@ P perspective and identifies opportunities to achieve greater sustainability within these sectors .
SC@@ P aims to reduce emissions , increase efficiencies and prevent unnecessary w@@ ast@@ age of resources within society , through the stages of material extraction , investment , production , distribution , consumption , to waste management .
in order to map out SC@@ P activities in the SE@@ E and EECCA regions , and to support the implementation of SC@@ P activities in countries , this report sets out to :
it is beyond the scope of the report to provide data on every indicator , individually , for every country within the two regions .
1 ) U@@ sed as a background document for a workshop of the UNECE @@@ -@@ @ WHO Transport , Environment and Health Pan @@@ -@@ @ European Programme
• The SE@@ E and EECCA regions cover 16 % of the global land area , contain 4.7 % of the world 's population , but generate only 2.4 % of the global GDP .
in all countries of the region , household expenditure by far exceeds government expenditure and is growing rapidly .
international trade in the EECCA However , foreign investment and exports have region ( 1994 @@@ -@@ @ 2005 ) tended to focus on a few key sectors and products , ensuring strong growth in these industries but less elsewhere .
this rule are transport services ( see Chapter 7 ) , and some social and communal services , such as the provision of drinking water and sanitation which have high energy intensi@@ ties .
1 ) decou@@ pling , which can be relative or absolute , occurs when the growth rate of an environmental pressure is less than that of a
( given economic driving force ( e.g. GDP ) over a certain period .
the gap between the poorest and wealthiest groups of society has increased in much of EECCA and is significantly higher than it was pre @@@ -@@ @ transition .
for example , in Russia in 1991 the poorest 20 % received 12 % of total national income , while the richest 20 % received 31 % ( Sim@@ ai , 2006 ) .
by 2003 the income gap had widened significantly with the poorest 20 % receiving only 6 % and the richest 20 % receiving 47 % ( World Bank , 2006 ) .
meanwhile in the large cities , there is evidence of a growing urban n@@ ou@@ ve@@ au ric@@ he and middle class .
the Ukrainian population decline results from both factors ; approximately three @@@ -@@ @ quarters due to increasing death rates and one @@@ -@@ @ quarter to emigration of people of working age ( Shan@@ gh@@ ina , 2004 ) .
in addition , consumption of processed food and goods , electronics etc. and generation of household waste is generally higher in urban than in rural areas .
0 A number of economy @@@ -@@ @ wide studies have identified the consumption categories with the highest pressures in the European Union ( EU Commission , 2006 ; EEA , 2005 ; Mol@@ l et al . , 2006 ) . these studies
however , with current knowledge , pressures from production or consumption C@@ AN@@ NOT easily be converted into information on specific environmental impacts .
the main challenge in a number of countries will be how to satisfy the basic needs of the population .
the chapter first provides a brief overview of the evolution of the environmental protection framework and then presents examples of policies and initiatives which can support implementation of sustainable consumption and production in SE@@ E and EECCA countries .
one of the main effects of the political and socioeconomic transformation in SE@@ E and EECCA countries was a fundamental change in the system for environmental protection .
coordination between various environmental bodies , including central and local authorities , remains a major challenge , as demonstrated in Bosnia and Herzegovina ( UNECE , 2004 ) .
in the 1990s most EECCA countries drew up National Environmental Action Plans , often with the assistance of international experts and support from donors .
a number of horizontal policies , strategies and instruments under development or already existing in the SE@@ E and EECCA countries are illustrated in this report , including the following :
many governments have adopted ambitious environmental legislation ( OECD , 2007 ) and quite a few countries are currently attempting to comply with EU directives .
the principle of cleaner production in Croatia is addressed both in the National Environmental Action Plan and National Environmental Protection Strategy .
in 2005 Ukraine adopted a new budget programme on financial support for environmental activities , operating within the framework of the state fund of environmental protection .
in 2005 several projects were financed through this system , including the renovation of the sewage system , improvement of solid waste collection , and development of the health system in three communities .

• In Kyrgyzstan , certain industrial facilities ( large mining facilities , thermal power stations , the water authority ) are required to report on their environmental activities in a format approved by the National Statistical Committee .
more energy @@@ -@@ @ efficient products tend to be more expensive to buy , but less expensive to use , and L@@ CC is sometimes used in a procurement procedure to factor this in .
when governments choose to buy goods and services that are environmentally preferable , they support sustainable production and consumption . application of G@@ PP can benefit the environment by :
procurement systems should be driven by the principle that an open , fair and transparent procurement process will allow for competition , and that competition will result in the most competitive prices .
• • • • • dispute resolution : possibility to challenge an award and seek remedies from a court or other independent body .
implementation of G@@ PP has been supported by heads of government and environment ministers in all important environment @@@ -@@ @ related political processes relevant to EECCA and SE@@ E :
D@@ G Environment is currently drafting a new EU Communication on G@@ PP , and non @@@ -@@ @ mandatory performance targets for G@@ PP are being discussed with Member States .
the OECD Council adopted in 2002 a Recommendation on Im@@ proving the Environmental Performance of Public Pro@@ cu@@ rement .
in Croatia , the estimated overall volume of procurement of governmental institutions on the national level in 2005 was EUR 4.5 billion , equivalent to about 14 % of GDP .
the quality of the Law is generally satisfactory , but a number of deficiencies still need to be addressed by the Government .
the law is not only stiff , costly , time @@@ -@@ @ consuming , bureaucratic and infl@@ exi@@ ble , but it also allows for the application of non @@@ -@@ @ competitive procedures too freely .
the quality of the Law is generally good , but there are a number of deficiencies that need to be addressed by the Government .
the reform is still in its initial phase , and a lot of work remains to be done over the coming years .
the OECD S@@ IG@@ MA program and a World Bank support program have focused on providing advice on improving PP systems in SE@@ E and EECCA countries .

in addition , all national public procurement offices / agencies established in SE@@ E and EECCA were contacted to complete or distribute the questionnaire .
the results presented above can serve as only an incomplete indication of current experience with G@@ PP in SE@@ E and EECCA countries .
none of the respondents has proc@@ ured biological or organic food , although most respondents said that biological / organic food is available in their cities .
this study not only asked PP officers about their use of environmental criteria in procurement , but also included tender analysis by independent specialists .
support and action would be required from national public procurement offices ( regulatory , supervisory and supporting bodies ) , and closer cooperation between environmental authorities and national public procurement offices will be essential .
except for Croatia , Serbia , and Uzbekistan , none of the countries in the EECCA and SE@@ E regions has introduced ec@@ ol@@ ab@@ els .

nevertheless , environmental requirements for imported products can be expected to be an issue mainly for trade with EU Member States and the US .
increased substantially in several countries in recent years , even if at present it remains significantly below the levels in new EU Member States .

as a country endowed with vast natural resources which have traditionally been made available to all consumers at very low prices , Russia has historically had little awareness of or inclination towards energy efficiency .
Russia has vast technical potential for renewable energy , particularly hydro , biomass and wind .
4.3 Policies and implementation improvements in energy efficiency offer a big potential in addressing the question of energy supply .
Ukraine , if it implemented all currently viable energy efficiency improvements , could reduce by half the 70 % of the gas supply it
since the break @@@ -@@ @ up of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia , many efforts have been made in the EECCA and SE@@ E countries to revise and improve the environmental legal and policy framework .
• large costs associated with B@@ AT implementation - significant input of technical resources and a high degree of support for both the regulator ( s ) and industry will be required ;
the expectation that environmental regulations will be more rigor@@ ously enforced may also have been a motivation there .

and advice they need on E@@ ST , as technology suppliers promote their products directly to them and because they generally have specialised staff .

as part of these activities , the Government of Ukraine agreed to sell excessive greenhouse gas emission quotas in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol .
one crucial aspect of such reform is improved enforcement . environmental enforcement agencies should , among others , start to work with tools such as compliance promotion .
there is a sizeable potential for environmentally sound technologies and in particular for the use of renewable energy .
food , along with housing and transportation , is one of those household consumption categories which cause the highest environmental impacts over the life @@@ -@@ @ cycle from the household sector .
access to food is a fundamental quality @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ life issue , and yet availability and access to food varies a great deal within each country and across countries .
food production in SE@@ E and EECCA countries has been affected by a relative stagnation of the agricultural sector during the 1990s and early 2000s .
the sharp reduction in agriculture and food production in most EECCA countries was accompanied by a strong drop in the use of fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ ers and pesticides until the mid @@@ -@@ @ 1990s .
therefore , most of the analysis on food consumption behaviour is based upon the results of three city studies carried out for this report in R@@ amen@@ skoye ( Russia ) , Belgrade ( Serbia ) and Ko@@ si@@ v ( Ukraine ) .
the structure of consumption and production of food in SE@@ E and EECCA countries was dramatically affected by the Soviet and Yugoslav leg@@ acies as well as by transition experiences during the 1990s .
where food was bought , purchases were mainly made in state @@@ -@@ @ run shops and farmers ' markets .
arable land was expanded at the expense of forests , and the drive to increase production relied heavily on extensive irrigation and drainage schemes and the intensive use of fer@@ ti@@ lis@@ ers and pesticides ( EEA , 2007 ) .
from the mid @@@ -@@ @ 1950s onwards , the Russian fleet was expanded and became the largest in the world with catches reaching their peak in the mid @@@ -@@ @ 1970s .
commerci@@ alisation of the fisheries led to the almost complete loss of control by the EECCA countries over levels of catches and sizes of fle@@ ets .
in addition a significant part of the Russian fishing fleet withdraw from international waters and re@@ located to Russian seas , leading to increasing pressure on fish stocks in those fisheries .
within the Caucasus , Armenia has many high @@@ -@@ @ rolling plat@@ e@@ aus and wide river valleys , with sharp mountains from the southern edge of the Caucasus .
this has led to a general reduction in poverty and under @@@ -@@ @ nour@@ ishment , and the diets of some regions are beginning to turn towards meat products again ( for relevance of this point , see Box 5.2 ) .
the agricultural sector has not recovered to the same extent as the rest of the economy , and rising demand for food is being increasingly met by imports .
Tajikistan is one of the most mountainous countries in the region - 93 % of its territory is mountainous with peaks reaching over 7 000 meters .
food supply and demand mechanisms are not fully operative ( based on the case study for Ukraine by Green D@@ ossi@@ er ) .
other factors also drive imports . these include an increasing demand for non @@@ -@@ @ seasonal foods , or foods which C@@ AN@@ NOT be produced domestically due to climatic and / or soil conditions .
production by the fishing fle@@ ets of remained high and since 1998 co@@ d stocks and EECCA and SE@@ E ( 1992 @@@ -@@ @ 2005 ) fishing pressure has exceeded safe biological limits
meanwhile , in the Black Sea , fish stocks have been affected by over@@ fishing , but also by pollution .
waters of the world 's oceans , but this catch diminished by around 50 @@@ -@@ @ 60 % during the 1990s , as the Russian fleet largely re@@ located to areas within the country 's economic zone ( M@@ ati@@ sh@@ ov et al . , 2004 ) .
the graphs show some underlying differences between the diets of the various sub @@@ -@@ @ regions which are likely to reflect the long @@@ -@@ @ term availability and affor@@ d@@ ability of types of food .
in Dagestan ( southwest of Russia ) it accounts for 60 % while in Western Siberia it is around 30 % .
however , income is not the only influencing factor in the proportion of income used to buy food - lifestyle , tradition , and preferences all play a role .
often , no one is willing to take responsibility for the removal and disposal of these stock@@ piles ( EEA , 2007 ) .
on average , 10 g of vegetable protein are needed to generate 1 g of animal protein ( Re@@ inj@@ ders and S@@ ore@@ t , 2003 ) .
all in all , the choice of diet has significant - if perhaps surprising - environmental implications , especially concerning energy and water use .
this leads to a drop in the stocks of the target species , but the ecosystem disruptions affect the rest of the food chain .
imports and exports of food products to and from EECCA countries decreased during the late @@@ -@@ @ 1990s , but have generally been on the increase since the beginning of this decade ( see Figure 5.3 ) .
this section of the Chapter draws heavily on the responses provided by countries to the SC@@ P survey carried out by UNEP in 2007 , in support of this report ( see Table 5.2 ) .
together with preferences for local and national food products ( albeit not on environmental grounds ) , this may be having a positive social effect and reduce demand for transportation of food .
in the SE@@ E countries the most important driving forces for facilitating food policy development are the St@@ abil@@ isation and approxim@@ ation Process ( SAP ) , institutional support from international organisations , and in some countries the drive for closer integration with the EU .
( 5 ) In Croatia , the Act on Plant Protection provides a regulatory framework for the use of pesticides . ( 6 ) Act on Organ@@ ic Production of Agr@@ u@@ icul@@ tural and Food Products ( O@@ G 12 / 2001 , 14 / 2001 ) .
food is also a fundamental quality @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ life issue , one which still has not yet been resolved .
for example , illegal sales of livestock products , vegetables , fruits , etc . , are a major income @@@ -@@ @ generator for many families , but this has in some cases led to the spread of diseases .
while this may have led to some reductions in environmental impacts , ag@@ ro@@ environmental problems of sal@@ in@@ isation , soil erosion , and contamination of surface water persist .
consumption of prepared and processed food as well as food imports have been increasing steadily since the end of the recession .
the decade following the break @@@ -@@ @ up of the Soviet Union saw the gradual collapse of the energy and water supply as well as the distribution systems .
however , this can only be achieved if carefully selected and enforced building codes are in place .
it is approximately 60 % of 1990 construction levels in EE and CA , and 40 % in the Caucasus .
so far , new construction has not met the rigorous ambitions of the plan due to un@@ attractive loan conditions .
construction rates were highest between 2000 and 2003 , but have now slowed .
the recycling of building waste is carried out ad hoc at the demol@@ ition site . construction companies may reuse some elements while the public also sc@@ av@@ eng@@ es .
as in the other cities , ad hoc recycling of windows , flo@@ or@@ boards , tiles , etc. is happening at demol@@ ition sites by city dwellers for use in their homes .
across EECCA and SE@@ E residential , public and commercial buildings consume around one @@@ -@@ @ third of total final energy consumption ( Figure 6.3 ) .
average residential energy consumption per capita across EECCA ( Figure 6.4 ) has declined since 1994 despite economic growth due mostly to drops in Russia and Ukraine .
this is significantly higher than in SE@@ E or the EU and is largely due to Eastern Europe .
* For Central Asian countries other than Uzbekistan , residential data only exist for electricity consumption . * * EECCA average does not include Central Asia other than Uzbekistan .
appliances : appliance ownership stagn@@ ated or even declined in most EECCA countries during the 1990s and early 2000s , as appliances bought during the 1980s fell into dis@@ repair .
it is expected that growth in appliance ownership will follow . ownership of high @@@ -@@ @ end appliances is highest in cities ( 10 ) .
greater ownership will be accompanied by increasing electricity consumption unless the efficiency of appliances improves at similar rates .
) In Montenegro , which has no district heating , 48 % of households use electricity for heating and 42 % use wood . however , only
approximately 60 % of the network is worn out in Moldova ( Austrian Energy Agency , 2006 ) and in Russia 40 to 70 % of the systems are in need of replacement .
the earlier high levels of subsidies have created the impression that the water supply , in particular , comes without any economic and environmental costs .
this may explain why non @@@ -@@ @ payment is lowest for electricity for which payment according to use is widespread ( see below ) .
this is similar to the situation in Dnipropetrovsk , although older buildings are also gradually being equipped with apartment level meters under the ' Programme on Re@@ structuring and Development of Hou@@ se@@ holds ' .
15 ) F@@ ank@@ ha@@ user and T@@ epic ( 2005 ) , based on a review of studies , suggest affor@@ d@@ ability thresholds of 10 % for electricity , 10 % for heat
( demand exceeded capacity ( Austrian Energy Agency , 2006 ) .
the impacts of extraction and fabrication of construction materials in EECCA and SE@@ E countries are not documented , but it can be assumed to have impacts on land use , impacts related to energy and water consumption and to generation of quar@@ rying waste .
• encouraging a switch to fuels with higher cal@@ ori@@ fic values , or to biomass or waste , in large heating boilers / co @@@ -@@ @ generation plants .
policies for the efficient use of energy in buildings are usually included in more general energy efficiency programmes under national energy strategies .
however , the government has considered adoption of the European label ( Har@@ r@@ ington and Dam@@ n@@ ics , 2001 ) .
this would either require new buildings to be connected to existing D@@ H networks or require the supply of autonomous rather than individual apartment @@@ -@@ @ based heating systems .
it provides thermal efficiency standards for new and renovated buildings , so that the energy consumption is at least 35 % lower than in older buildings .
it seeks to ensure compliance with codes by requiring energy audits and gives guidance on carrying out energy audits as well as identifying retro@@ fit measures for old buildings .
only two countries among those that replied to the UNEP policy questionnaire have policies aimed at encouraging the reuse of demol@@ ition waste in new construction .
24 ) For example , in the Russian Federation tariff changes need to be approved by the Federal Energy Commission .
it did not provide much incentive for reducing consumption and was subsequently revised to 0 @@@ -@@ @ 4 200 kWh per household ( S@@ IE@@ PA , 2005 ) .
there is also a block tariff system in place in Georgia with the following three bands : 0 @@@ -@@ @ 1 200 kWh ; 1 200 @@@ -@@ @ 3 600 kWh ; and over 3 600 kWh per household per year ( city study ) .
in densely @@@ -@@ @ populated cities with col@@ der clim@@ ates , D@@ H can be more cost @@@ -@@ @ effective and environmentally advantageous than autonomous building level systems , provided the systems have been modern@@ ised and distribution losses reduced . use of
between 1997 @@@ -@@ @ 1999 Lviv Te@@ plo@@ kom@@ un@@ energo , a state @@@ -@@ @ owned heating enterprise , undertook a major refurb@@ ishment of distribution pi@@ ping in the city network and the pi@@ ping systems within buildings to reduce heat losses and water leaks .
between 1997 @@@ -@@ @ 1999 the Irkutsk Municipal Enterprise , in association with the Irkutsk Energy Centre , and with a USD 3.2 million loan from Sberbank , carried out a D@@ H renovation project .
a World Bank project in Cher@@ epo@@ vets , Russia , retro@@ fitted 6@@ 63 buildings to improve thermal efficiency during the late 1990s .
a project led by a German @@@ -@@ @ Bosnian company with the participation of E@@ AN @@@ -@@ @ Nord GmbH has set the goal of establishing a ge@@ other@@ mal heating plant for a group of buildings in L@@ id@@ za , a suburb of Sarajevo .
2 frameworks to help solar water heating . the target is 20 % growth per year to reach 5@@ 40 000 m of installed capacity by the end of 2020 .
the UNDP / GEF financed a pilot and capacity @@@ -@@ @ building project , with participation from the local D@@ H Company ( AT@@ K@@ E ) to install a solar pre @@@ -@@ @ heating plant at a district heating boiler house .
Russia has the largest potential for J@@ I projects among all eligible countries ( IC@@ FI , 2006 ) .
an alternative mechanism under the Kyoto protocol is emissions trading of so @@@ -@@ @ called As@@ sign A@@ mount Un@@ its ( A@@ AU ) .
an example is the state @@@ -@@ @ owned Ukrainian Energy Services Company ( Ukr@@ E@@ sc@@ o ) which has access to loans and grants from the EBRD and the EU 's technical assistance programme ( T@@ AC@@ IS ) ( Ev@@ ans , 2001 ) .

• adopting energy label legislation for appliances , or setting up minimum energy @@@ -@@ @ efficiency standards for appliances .
since 2000 the amount of freight transported in SE@@ E and EE has begun to increase again .
in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus , rail freight has generally maintained a similar share of the freight market ( e.g. at least 80 % ) since 1970 .
pollution is exacerbated by the age of the vehicles , poor vehicle maintenance , variable fuel quality , and the poor condition of many of the roads .
where lead@@ ed petrol is still in use , plans for its ph@@ asing out will be made in the coming years .
data for passenger travel by car and ' soft ' modes , i.e. walking and cycling , are far less comprehensive and in some cases virtually non @@@ -@@ @ existent . figures
however , passenger numbers peaked at , respectively , 30 and 40 million people a year a decade earlier .
meanwhile , the use of inland water@@ ways is expected to grow by up to 2@@ 15 % , while air travel might increase by anything between 3@@ 15 % and 8@@ 30 % ( CO@@ W@@ I , 2003 ) .
in addition , air freight transport accounts for a marginal share ( fraction of a percent ) of total freight in EECCA and SE@@ E countries .
see countries have seen greater investment in public transport , as networks have been maintained , and in some cases , e.g. in Zagreb ( see Box 7.1 ) , even expanded .
all of these factors contribute to a reduction in the operational capacity of the network and in the speed of operations ( World Bank , 2004 ) .
this situation is particularly per@@ tinent for SE@@ E and EECCA countries . finally , cars are a necessity in rural areas , where the quality of public transport has declined .
road networks in SE@@ E and EECCA countries also lack investment , despite the fact that they have attracted far more investment than railways or any other forms of public transport .
the relative decline of the state @@@ -@@ @ owned public transport system has given rise to a growing number of private operators , usually operating mini@@ buses , in many Russian cities .
additionally , such mini@@ buses tend to be well utilis@@ ed and thus more environmentally efficient than private car use .
of Albania 's national road network was considered to meet this standard and 68 % was judged to be poor .
transport depends on fossil fuels , particularly oil products , which account for more than 98 % of
air pollution in the countries of SE@@ E and EECCA is more and more of a problem , particularly in urban areas .
in addition , some toxic materials including heavy metals are used in vehicle construction and need to be disposed of with due care .
transport infrastructure can also make significant demands upon non @@@ -@@ @ renewable resources , especially in situations , such as those now occurring in some SE@@ E and EECCA countries , where major new infrastructure is under construction .
in urban areas heavily @@@ -@@ @ used new infrastructure can also have a negative impact on the mobility of people within cities .
it enables free movement of people , goods and services and offers possibilities for trade , living , leisure , learning and retail shopping .
in Armenia the car fleet is old : 30 % are more than 20 years old and over 70 % of the cars imported into the country are second @@@ -@@ @ hand .
the increasing number of mini@@ buses and private taxis , which are replacing larger , publicly @@@ -@@ @ operated buses , are adding to the cong@@ estion problems .
quality and emissions legislation with that of the EU , although progress is more advanced in some countries , particularly those that aim to acc@@ ede to the EU .
in many EECCA countries Russian fuel quality standards are used , and they are stricter than some of those previously applied in SE@@ E , but are not as stringent as those of the EU ( RE@@ C , 2006 ) .
the decline of public transport at the expense of private transport also reduces the potential mobility of those who previously relied on public transport and who do not have access to private cars .
this is due to the increased use of the fuel by mini@@ buses , buses and light @@@ -@@ @ duty trucks and has been stimulated by the fact that CN@@ G costs about one @@@ -@@ @ third of the price of petrol ( Ts@@ ar@@ uk@@ yan , 2006 ) .
the most energy @@@ -@@ @ efficient and affordable modes are , of course , walking and cycling as they entail virtually no use of fossil fuels or other non @@@ -@@ @ renewable resources , and are ,
efficient passenger transport also implies land @@@ -@@ @ use patterns that minimise the need to travel long distances for goods , services , jobs and the use of public transport .
transport plans include provisions on reducing cong@@ estion and encouraging public transport use for both passenger and freight travel .
elsewhere , e.g. in Tajikistan and Georgia , environmental issues are identified as priorities in national Poverty Reduction Strate@@ gies .
the recognition of the need to determine prices in a fair manner is also a feature of the transport development strategy in Montenegro .
the import taxes for older vehicles were increased in 2005 . these represented an increase of 25 % on previous levels for cars that were more than 10 years old and a tre@@ bling of taxes for cars more than 14 years old .
the import tax rates on newer cars ( i.e. those less than 3 years old ) are higher than those on cars between three and ten years old in order to increase tax revenue .
this can lead to a downward spiral in what were in most cases historically very good levels of public transport availability .
in an effort to reduce emissions from cars , from 1 January 2007 , Armenia banned the import of cars without cataly@@ tic conver@@ ters .
legislation is currently being developed in Montenegro to address the problems arising from the import and use of second @@@ -@@ @ hand vehicles , while in Macedonia and Serbia the import of second @@@ -@@ @ hand cars more than six years old is banned .
many SE@@ E countries aspire to join the EU , while the economies of the Central Asian Repub@@ lics are still linked to other countries of the former Soviet Union .
however , for this to happen , institutional capacity needs to be increased and policy frameworks need to be developed .
while there is recognition of the problems of the supply side of transport , and measures are being taken to address this wherever possible , less attention is still being paid to the demand side .
transport wider environmental and health considerations into account ( e.g. EC@@ MT , 2005 ) .
finally , in order to ensure that environmental considerations are taken into account in the construction of infrastructures , wider , better and more consistent use of environmental impact assessments is essential .
it is estimated at 14 tonnes per year compared with 4 tonnes in the EU .
almost none of the land@@ fills operated in the EECCA and SE@@ E countries have an installation for land@@ fill gas collection .
the economic returns generated could offset investments in methane collection and finance additional improvements in land@@ fill operations or other waste management initiatives .
reducing the amounts of waste generated across all economic activities , including production and consumption phases requires a holistic approach for which SC@@ P is particularly suitable .
the Soviet Union generated large amounts of waste but failed to manage them in an appropriate manner .
significant amounts of radioactive waste , chemical weapons , toxic missile fuel and other hazardous waste were stored in mines and at industrial and military facilities .
waste was not - and is still not - regarded as a significant threat to the environment and human health , nor is it perceived as a potential source of valuable resources .
poorly operated or abandoned mining sites and associated processing activities ( e.g. heavy metals and cy@@ an@@ ide ) have caused severe water pollution ( UNEP , 200@@ 6@@ c ) .
extraction of coal , the largest single source of waste , generates almost as much solid waste as the amount of the extracted coal .
open pit ( surface ) mining of coal and underground coal mining differ in terms of the types and amounts of waste generated .
the classification of waste is based on the hazardous nature of the compounds and the content of the dangerous substances .
it is estimated that in Kazakhstan 6.7 billion tonnes of hazardous waste has already been accumulated , and the quantities continue to grow ( Kazakhstan ME@@ P , 200@@ 6@@ b ) .
in the Russian Federation and Ukraine , the countries with the largest generation of hazardous waste , between 30 % and 50 % of hazardous waste is now reported as recovered or recycled .
by 2006 , there was no sign of improvement in hazardous waste treatment facilities ( RE@@ C , 2006 ) .
for example , F@@ Y@@ R of Macedonia submitted an implementation plan of the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants , while Albania implemented the amendments of the Basel Convention .
Georgia has reported the same total MS@@ W amount for the entire period .
more detailed studies have been made on the composition of household waste in the city of Donetsk in Ukraine , which has a population of approx . 1.5 million .
the share of food waste is higher during the summer and autumn seasons than during the rest of the year due to the consumption of more vegetables at this time of year .
however , older land@@ fills , established in the Soviet time , are normally exempt from environmental permits .
certain types of packaging waste in Moscow already have quite high recycling rates , for example , a 90 % rate of recycling for aluminium packaging waste .
about 1.7 billion beverage units are sold each year in Croatia , with an ever @@@ -@@ @ increasing part of the containers made of aluminium and PE@@ T .
this included 14 000 tonnes of PE@@ T , 57 000 tonnes of glass and 1 400 tonnes of aluminium and steel .
however , it has been possible for all four cities to provide the most relevant data at least for some years ( T@@ ables 8.6 and 8.7 ) .
the situation differs concerning the number and quality of collection trucks , but in general it seems that the quality of the service has improved .
2 ) Table 8.@@ 8 is based on an extensive UNEP policy questionnaire sent to all the SE@@ E and EECCA countries in October 2006 . the
in the case of Dnipropetrovsk strong action was taken by NGOs and the political and administrative sector to develop a municipal waste strategy for 2007 @@@ -@@ @ 2011 .
the examples of Dnipropetrovsk and Tbilisi , which put waste management issues high on their municipal agenda , could give positive signals and inspiration to other countries .
several countries have in recent years initiated activities to implement EU standards for waste facilities ( e.g. Croatia and Ukraine ) .
in general , there is a lack of data ( and lack of related data collection systems ) on generation and treatment of waste , including municipal waste .
environmental technologies . much bio@@ degrad@@ able waste was land@@ filled in the past ( Note : this situation is expected to continue in the near future ) , and the potential for collecting methane from land@@ fills is there .
available policy options include prevention of the organic waste and utilis@@ ation of those resources in the municipal waste .
as was shown by the experience of Tbilisi where collection and disposal of waste were coordinated in one unit .
the approach was subsequently adjusted to separate recy@@ cl@@ able waste fr@@ actions from the mixed waste ; firstly , to increase recycling or resource recovery from wastes , and then to limit land@@ filling to non @@@ -@@ @ recy@@ cl@@ able wastes only .
general improvements at national and city levels will require a step @@@ -@@ @ wise approach and a long @@@ -@@ @ term horizon .
- ensuring that new and existing inc@@ iner@@ ators comply with high technical standards , such as those used in the European Union .
most EECCA and SE@@ E economies have been experiencing rapid economic growth since the beginning of the decade , following the economic decline of the 1990s .
the common challenge for all countries is to break the link between economic growth and environmental impacts from production and consumption , resource use and waste generation .
this is partly explained by cold clim@@ ates , but other important causes include widespread but inefficient district heating , inefficient distribution systems , and the low thermal efficiency of buildings .
furthermore , given the current construction boom in some countries , quantities of construction and demol@@ ition waste will increase .
in some countries , where environmental legislation is being tightened and enforcement is getting stricter , improvements in industry have already occurred .
Uzbekistan developed an inventory of waste disposal and recycling sites . as of 1 October 2006 there are 17@@ 1 solid waste sites ,
