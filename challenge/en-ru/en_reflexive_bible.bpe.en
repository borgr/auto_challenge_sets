therefore when you do mer@@ ciful deeds , don '@@ t sound a trum@@ pet before yourself , as the hypo@@ crit@@ es do in the syn@@ agogues and in the streets , that they may get glory from men . most certainly I tell you , they have received their reward .
" Don '@@ t lay up treasures for yourselves on the earth , where moth and r@@ ust consume , and where thieves break through and steal ;
therefore don '@@ t be anxious for tomorrow , for tomorrow will be anxious for itself . each day 's own evil is sufficient .
behold , some of the scri@@ bes said to themselves , " This man bl@@ asph@@ em@@ es . "
for she said within herself , " If I just touch his garment , I will be made well . "
he called to himself his twelve disciples , and gave them authority over un@@ clean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal every disease and every sickness .
knowing their thoughts , Jesus said to them , " Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to des@@ ol@@ ation , and every city or house divided against itself will not stand .
if Satan casts out Satan , he is divided against himself . how then will his kingdom stand ?
then he goes , and takes with himself seven other spirits more evil than he is , and they enter in and dwell there . the last state of that man becomes worse than the first . even so will it be also to this evil generation . "
yet he has no root in himself , but endu@@ res for a while . when oppression or persecution arises because of the word , immediately he stum@@ bles .
they reasoned among themselves , saying , " We brought no bread . "
after six days , Jesus took with him Peter , James , and John his brother , and brought them up into a high mountain by themselves .
'@@ Honor your father and mother . ' and , ' You shall love your neighbor as yourself . ' "
the baptism of John , where was it from ? from heaven or from men ? " they reasoned with themselves , saying , " If we say , ' From heaven , ' he will ask us , ' Why then did you not believe him ? '
a second likewise is this , ' You shall love your neighbor as yourself . '
w@@ oe to you , scri@@ bes and Pharis@@ ees , hypo@@ crit@@ es ! for you travel around by sea and land to make one pro@@ sel@@ yte ; and when he becomes one , you make him twice as much of a son of Ge@@ hen@@ na as yourselves .
therefore you testify to yourselves that you are children of those who killed the prophets .
but the wise answered , saying , ' What if there is@@ n '@@ t enough for us and you ? you go rather to those who sell , and buy for yourselves . '
when evening had come , a rich man from Ari@@ ma@@ th@@ a@@ ea , named Joseph , who himself was also Jesus ' disciple came .
they were all amazed , so that they questioned among themselves , saying , " What is this ? a new teaching ? for with authority he commands even the un@@ clean spirits , and they obey him ! "
immediately Jesus , percei@@ ving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves , said to them , " Why do you reason these things in your hearts ?
if a kingdom is divided against itself , that kingdom C@@ AN@@ NOT stand .
if a house is divided against itself , that house C@@ AN@@ NOT stand .
if Satan has risen up against himself , and is divided , he can '@@ t stand , but has an end .
they have no root in themselves , but are short @@@ -@@ @ lived . when oppression or persecution arises because of the word , immediately they stum@@ ble .
immediately Jesus , percei@@ ving in himself that the power had gone out from him , turned around in the crowd , and asked , " Who touched my clothes ? "
he called to himself the twelve , and began to send them out two by two ; and he gave them authority over the un@@ clean spirits .
for Her@@ od himself had sent out and arrested John , and bound him in prison for the sake of Her@@ odi@@ as , his brother Philip 's wife , for he had married her .
they went away in the boat to a deserted place by themselves .
he got into the boat with them ; and the wind ceased , and they were very amazed among themselves , and marv@@ eled ;
in those days , when there was a very great multitude , and they had nothing to eat , Jesus called his disciples to himself , and said to them ,
he called the multitude to himself with his disciples , and said to them , " Who@@ ever wants to come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
after six days Jesus took with him Peter , James , and John , and brought them up onto a high mountain privately by themselves , and he was changed into another form in front of them .
they kept this saying to themselves , questioning what the " rising from the dead " meant .
he came to Cap@@ ern@@ au@@ m , and when he was in the house he asked them , " What were you arguing among yourselves on the way ? "
salt is good , but if the salt has lost its sal@@ t@@ iness , with what will you season it ? have salt in yourselves , and be at peace with one another . "
they reasoned with themselves , saying , " If we should say , ' From heaven ; ' he will say , ' Why then did you not believe him ? '
the second is like this , ' You shall love your neighbor as yourself . ' there is no other commandment greater than these . "
and to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbor as himself , is more important than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices . "
he called his disciples to himself , and said to them , " Most certainly I tell you , this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury ,
but there were some who were indig@@ n@@ ant among themselves , saying , " Why has this o@@ int@@ ment been wasted ?
a certain young man followed him , having a linen cloth thrown around himself , over his naked body . the young men grabbed him ,
likewise , also the chief priests mo@@ cking among themselves with the scri@@ bes said , " He saved others . he can '@@ t save himself .
Joseph of Ari@@ ma@@ th@@ a@@ ea , a prominent council member who also himself was looking for the Kingdom of God , came . he boldly went in to Pil@@ ate , and asked for Jesus ' body .
he who believes and is baptized will be saved ; but he who dis@@ believes will be condemned .
after these days Elizabeth , his wife , conceived , and she hid herself five months , saying ,
bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and don '@@ t begin to say among yourselves , ' We have Abraham for our father ; ' for I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones !
Jesus himself , when he began to teach , was about thirty years old , being the son ( as was supposed ) of Joseph , the son of Hel@@ i ,
Jesus went with them . when he was now not far from the house , the cent@@ ur@@ ion sent friends to him , saying to him , " Lord , don '@@ t trouble yourself , for I am not worthy for you to come under my roof .
John , calling to himself two of his disciples , sent them to Jesus , saying , " Are you the one who is coming , or should we look for another ? "
now when the Pharis@@ ee who had invited him saw it , he said to himself , " This man , if he were a prophet , would have perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him , that she is a sinner . "
those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves , " Who is this who even for@@ gives sins ? "
he answered , " You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart , with all your soul , with all your strength , and with all your mind ; and your neighbor as yourself . "
but he , knowing their thoughts , said to them , " Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to des@@ ol@@ ation . a house divided against itself falls .
if Satan also is divided against himself , how will his kingdom stand ? for you say that I cast out demons by Be@@ el@@ ze@@ bul .
then he goes , and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself , and they enter in and dwell there . the last state of that man becomes worse than the first . "
he reasoned within himself , saying , ' What will I do , because I don '@@ t have room to store my crops ? '
so is he who lays up treasure for himself , and is not rich toward God . "
why don '@@ t you judge for yourselves what is right ?
there will be we@@ eping and gn@@ ashing of teeth , when you see Abraham , Isaac , Jacob , and all the prophets , in the Kingdom of God , and yourselves being thrown outside .
but when he came to himself he said , ' How many hired servants of my father 's have bread enough to spare , and I 'm dying with hunger !
he w@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t for a while , but afterward he said to himself , ' Th@@ ough I neither fear God , nor respect man ,
the Pharis@@ ee stood and prayed to himself like this : ' God , I thank you , that I am not like the rest of men , extor@@ tion@@ ers , un@@ righteous , adul@@ ter@@ ers , or even like this tax collector .
he said therefore , " A certain no@@ bl@@ eman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom , and to return .
they reasoned with themselves , saying , " If we say , ' From heaven , ' he will say , ' Why did@@ n '@@ t you believe him ? '
" but when the farmers saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , ' This is the heir . come , let 's kill him , that the inheritance may be ours . '
they began to question among themselves , which of them it was who would do this thing .
they began to accuse him , saying , " We found this man perver@@ ting the nation , forbid@@ ding paying taxes to Caes@@ ar , and saying that he himself is Christ , a king . "
but Jesus , turning to them , said , " Dau@@ ghters of Jerusalem , don '@@ t we@@ ep for me , but we@@ ep for yourselves and for your children .
and saying , " If you are the King of the Jews , save yourself ! "
one of the criminals who was han@@ ged insul@@ ted him , saying , " If you are the Christ , save yourself and us ! "
but Peter got up and ran to the tomb . sto@@ oping and looking in , he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves , and he departed to his home , wondering what had happened .
beginning from Moses and from all the prophets , he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself .
are you greater than our father , Jacob , who gave us the well , and drank of it himself , as did his children , and his livestock ? "
Jesus therefore answered them , " Most certainly , I tell you , the Son can do nothing of himself , but what he sees the Father doing . for whatever things he does , these the Son also does likewise .
for as the Father has life in himself , even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself .
" if I testify about myself , my witness is not valid .
the Father himself , who sent me , has testified about me . you have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his form .
but I know you , that you don '@@ t have God 's love in yourselves .
Jesus therefore , percei@@ ving that they were about to come and take him by force , to make him king , withdrew again to the mountain by himself .
therefore Jesus answered them , " Don '@@ t mur@@ mur among yourselves .
Jesus therefore said to them , " Most certainly I tell you , unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood , you don '@@ t have life in yourselves .
but Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples mur@@ mu@@ red at this , said to them , " Does this cause you to stum@@ ble ?
if anyone desires to do his will , he will know about the teaching , whether it is from God , or if I am speaking from myself .
he who speaks from himself seeks his own glory , but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true , and no un@@ righteousness is in him .
Jesus therefore cried out in the temple , teaching and saying , " You both know me , and know where I am from . I have not come of myself , but he who sent me is true , whom you don '@@ t know .
the Jews therefore said among themselves , " Where will this man go that we won '@@ t find him ? will he go to the Dis@@ per@@ sion among the Greeks , and teach the Greeks ?
the Pharis@@ ees therefore said to him , " You testify about yourself . your testimony is not valid . "
Jesus answered them , " Even if I testify about myself , my testimony is true , for I know where I came from , and where I am going ; but you don '@@ t know where I came from , or where I am going .
I am one who testi@@ fies about myself , and the Father who sent me testi@@ fies about me . "
Jesus therefore said to them , " When you have lifted up the Son of Man , then you will know that I am he , and I do nothing of myself , but as my Father taught me , I say these things .
therefore Jesus said to them , " If God were your father , you would love me , for I came out and have come from God . for I haven '@@ t come of myself , but he sent me .
but how he now sees , we don '@@ t know ; or who opened his eyes , we don '@@ t know . he is of age . ask him . he will speak for himself . "
no one takes it away from me , but I lay it down by myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . I received this commandment from my Father . "
Jesus therefore , again gro@@ aning in himself , came to the tomb . now it was a cave , and a stone lay against it .
the Pharis@@ ees therefore said among themselves , " See how you accomplish nothing . behold , the world has gone after him . "
for I spoke not from myself , but the Father who sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
if God has been glori@@ fied in him , God will also glori@@ fy him in himself , and he will glori@@ fy him immediately .
if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and will receive you to myself ; that where I am , you may be there also .
Don '@@ t you believe that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? the words that I tell you , I speak not from myself ; but the Father who lives in me does his works .
remain in me , and I in you . as the branch can '@@ t bear fruit by itself , unless it remains in the vine , so neither can you , unless you remain in me .
however when he , the Spirit of truth , has come , he will guide you into all truth , for he will not speak from himself ; but whatever he hears , he will speak . he will declare to you things that are coming .
but now I come to you , and I say these things in the world , that they may have my joy made full in themselves .
Jesus answered him , " Do you say this by yourself , or did others tell you about me ? "
and the cloth that had been on his head , not lying with the linen clo@@ ths , but rolled up in a place by itself .
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves ,
but Peter and John answered them , " Whe@@ ther it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God , judge for yourselves ,
Jacob went down into Egypt , and he died , himself and our fathers ,
the e@@ un@@ uch answered Philip , " Who is the prophet talking about ? about himself , or about someone else ? "
now while Peter was very perpl@@ exed in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean , behold , the men who were sent by Corn@@ eli@@ us , having made inquiry for Simon 's house , stood before the gate ,
when Peter had come to himself , he said , " Now I truly know that the Lord has sent out his angel and delivered me out of the hand of Her@@ od , and from everything the Jewish people were expecting . "
we have sent therefore Jud@@ as and Sil@@ as , who themselves will also tell you the same things by word of mouth .
but these things don '@@ t count ; nor do I hold my life dear to myself , so that I may finish my race with joy , and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus , to fully testify to the Good News of the grace of God .
take heed , therefore , to yourselves , and to all the flock , in which the Holy Spirit has made you over@@ se@@ ers , to shepherd the assembly of the Lord and God which he purchased with his own blood .
they came to the chief priests and the elders , and said , " We have bound ourselves under a great curse , to taste nothing until we have killed Paul .
A@@ gri@@ pp@@ a said to Paul , " You may speak for yourself . " then Paul stretched out his hand , and made his defense .
when we entered into Rome , the cent@@ ur@@ ion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard , but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him .
when they did@@ n '@@ t agree among themselves , they departed after Paul had spoken one word , " The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah , the prophet , to our fathers ,
when he had said these words , the Jews departed , having a great dispute among themselves .
therefore God also gave them up in the lu@@ sts of their hearts to un@@ clean@@ ness , that their bodies should be dis@@ honored among themselves ,
likewise also the men , leaving the natural function of the woman , burned in their lust toward one another , men doing what is inappropriate with men , and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error .
in that they show the work of the law written in their hearts , their conscience testi@@ fying with them , and their thoughts among themselves accusing or else exc@@ using them )
to demonstrate his righteousness at this present time ; that he might himself be just , and the justi@@ fier of him who has faith in Jesus .
not only so , but ourselves also , who have the first fruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves gro@@ an within ourselves , waiting for adoption , the redemption of our body .
but how does God answer him ? " I have reserved for myself seven thousand men , who have not bowed the knee to Ba@@ al . "
so then each one of us will give account of himself to God .
I know , and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus , that nothing is un@@ clean of itself ; except that to him who considers anything to be un@@ clean , to him it is un@@ clean .
do you have faith ? have it to yourself before God . happy is he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t judge himself in that which he approves .
if any man 's work is burned , he will suffer loss , but he himself will be saved , but as through fire .
for I know nothing against myself . yet I am not justified by this , but he who judges me is the Lord .
now these things , brothers , I have in a figure transferred to myself and A@@ pol@@ los for your s@@ akes , that in us you might learn not to think beyond the things which are written , that none of you be pu@@ ffed up against one another .
judge for yourselves . is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled ?
but let a man examine himself , and so let him eat of the bread , and drink of the cup .
for he who eats and drinks in an un@@ worthy way eats and drinks judgment to himself , if he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t discern the Lord 's body .
yes , we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves , that we should not trust in ourselves , but in God who raises the dead ,
but I determined this for myself , that I would not come to you again in sorrow .
not that we are sufficient of ourselves , to account anything as from ourselves ; but our sufficiency is from God ;
for we don '@@ t preach ourselves , but Christ Jesus as Lord , and ourselves as your servants for Jesus ' sake ;
but we have this treasure in clay vessels , that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of God , and not from ourselves .
for if we are beside ourselves , it is for God . or if we are of sober mind , it is for you .
he died for all , that those who live should no longer live to themselves , but to him who for their s@@ akes died and rose again .
but all things are of God , who reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ , and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation ;
namely , that God was in Christ reconc@@ iling the world to himself , not reckoning to them their t@@ resp@@ asses , and having committed to us the word of reconciliation .
for he indeed accepted our ex@@ hor@@ tation , but being himself very earnest , he went out to you of his own accord .
now I Paul , myself , entre@@ at you by the humility and gentl@@ eness of Christ ; I who in your presence am low@@ ly among you , but being absent am bold toward you .
for we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with some of those who comm@@ end themselves . but they themselves , measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves with themselves , are without understanding .
are they servants of Christ ? ( I speak as one beside himself ) I am more so ; in lab@@ ors more ab@@ und@@ antly , in prisons more ab@@ und@@ antly , in stri@@ pes above measure , in deaths often .
for if I build up again those things which I destroyed , I prove myself a law @@@ -@@ @ breaker .
for the whole law is fulfilled in one word , in this : " you shall love your neighbor as yourself . "
brothers , even if a man is caught in some fault , you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentl@@ eness ; looking to yourself so that you also are@@ n '@@ t tempted .
but let each man test his own work , and then he will take pride in himself and not in his neighbor .
for by grace you have been saved through faith , and that not of yourselves ; it is the gift of God ,
having abolished in the flesh the hostility , the law of commandments contained in ordin@@ ances , that he might create in himself one new man of the two , making peace ;
being built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Christ Jesus himself being the chief cornerstone ;
from whom all the body , being fitted and knit together through that which every joint supplies , according to the working in measure of each individual part , makes the body increase to the building up of itself in love .
for the husband is the head of the wife , and Christ also is the head of the assembly , being himself the s@@ avi@@ or of the body .
that he might present the assembly to himself glori@@ ously , not having spot or wrink@@ le or any such thing ; but that it should be holy and without bl@@ emish .
nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself ; and let the wife see that she respects her husband .
doing nothing through rivalry or through conce@@ it , but in humility , each counting others better than himself ;
who will change the body of our humiliation to be con@@ formed to the body of his glory , according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things to himself .
now may our God and Father himself , and our Lord Jesus Christ , direct our way to you ;
for the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the ar@@ chang@@ el , and with God 's trum@@ pet . the dead in Christ will rise first ,
and to respect and honor them in love for their work 's sake . be at peace among yourselves .
he who opposes and exal@@ ts himself against all that is called God or that is worshi@@ ped ; so that he sits as God in the temple of God , setting himself up as God .
now our Lord Jesus Christ himself , and God our Father , who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace ,
now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways . the Lord be with you all .
pay attention to yourself , and to your teaching . continue in these things , for in doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you .
who gave himself for us , that he might re@@ deem us from all ini@@ qu@@ ity , and puri@@ fy for himself a people for his own possession , z@@ eal@@ ous for good works .
because of this , he must offer sacrifices for sins for the people , as well as for himself .
nobody takes this honor on himself , but he is called by God , just like Aaron was .
for when God made a promise to Abraham , since he could swear by none greater , he s@@ wore by himself ,
who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t need , like those high priests , to offer up sacrifices daily , first for his own sins , and then for the sins of the people . for he did this once for all , when he offered up himself .
but into the second the high priest alone , once in the year , not without blood , which he offers for himself , and for the errors of the people .
for you both had compassion on me in my chains , and joy@@ fully accepted the pl@@ undering of your possessions , knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one in the heavens .
for consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself , that you don '@@ t grow weary , fain@@ ting in your souls .
haven '@@ t you shown partiality among yourselves , and become judges with evil thoughts ?
however , if you fulfill the royal law , according to the Scripture , " You shall love your neighbor as yourself , " you do well .
and above all things be earnest in your love among yourselves , for love covers a multitude of sins .
but false prophets also arose among the people , as false teachers will also be among you , who will secretly bring in destructive here@@ sies , denying even the Master who bought them , bringing on themselves swift destruction .
he who says he remains in him ought himself also to walk just like he walked .
he who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself . he who do@@ es@@ n '@@ t believe God has made him a li@@ ar , because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning his Son .
but you , beloved , keep building up yourselves on your most holy faith , praying in the Holy Spirit .
the beast that was , and is not , is himself also an eighth , and is of the seven ; and he goes to destruction .
I heard a loud voice out of heaven saying , " Be@@ hold , God 's dwelling is with people , and he will dwell with them , and they will be his people , and God himself will be with them as their God .
and God said , Let the earth bring forth grass , the her@@ b yielding seed , and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind , whose seed is in itself , upon the earth : and it was so .
and the king of So@@ dom said unto Ab@@ ram , Gi@@ ve me the persons , and take the goods to thy@@ self .
therefore Sarah laughed within herself , saying , After I am wa@@ xed old shall I have pleasure , my lord being old also ?
and Abraham set seven e@@ we lam@@ bs of the flock by themselves .
and Ab@@ im@@ elec@@ h said unto Abraham , What mean these seven e@@ we lam@@ bs which thou hast set by themselves ?
and said , By myself have I sworn , sa@@ ith the LORD , for because thou hast done this thing , and hast not with@@ held thy son , th@@ ine only son :
and he set three days ' journey bet@@ wi@@ x@@ t himself and Jacob : and Jacob fed the rest of Lab@@ an 's f@@ locks .
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants , every drove by themselves ; and said unto his servants , Pass over before me , and put a space bet@@ wi@@ x@@ t drove and drove .
and Es@@ au said , I have enough , my brother ; keep that thou hast unto thy@@ self .
and they set on for him by himself , and for them by themselves , and for the Egyptians , which did eat with him , by themselves : because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the He@@ bre@@ ws ; for that is an ab@@ om@@ ination unto the Egyptians .
and Jud@@ ah said , What shall we say unto my lord ? what shall we speak ? or how shall we clear ourselves ? God hath found out the ini@@ qu@@ ity of thy servants : behold , we are my lord 's servants , both we , and he also with whom the cup is found .
now therefore be not griev@@ ed , nor angry with yourselves , that ye sold me hi@@ ther : for God did send me before you to preserve life .
and Jacob called unto his sons , and said , G@@ ather yourselves together , that I may tell you that which shall be@@ fall you in the last days .
ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick , as her@@ et@@ o@@ fore : let them go and gather straw for themselves .
as yet exal@@ test thou thy@@ self against my people , that thou wil@@ t not let them go ?
and Phar@@ aoh said unto him , Get thee from me , take heed to thy@@ self , see my face no more ; for in that day thou se@@ est my face thou shalt die .
and all these thy servants shall come down unto me , and bow down themselves unto me , saying , Get thee out , and all the people that follow thee : and after that I will go out . and he went out from Phar@@ aoh in a great anger .
and they baked un@@ leav@@ ened cakes of the d@@ ough which they brought forth out of Egypt , for it was not leav@@ ened ; because they were thrust out of Egypt , and could not tar@@ ry , neither had they prepared for themselves any vic@@ tual .
and when Moses ' father in law saw all that he did to the people , he said , What is this thing that thou do@@ est to the people ? why sit@@ test thou thy@@ self alone , and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even ?
thou wil@@ t surely wear away , both thou , and this people that is with thee : for this thing is too heavy for thee ; thou art not able to perform it thy@@ self alone .
and let them judge the people at all seasons : and it shall be , that every great matter they shall bring unto thee , but every small matter they shall judge : so shall it be easier for thy@@ self , and they shall bear the burden with thee .
ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians , and how I bare you on eag@@ les ' wings , and brought you unto myself .
and thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about , saying , Take heed to yourselves , that ye go not up into the mount , or touch the border of it : wh@@ oso@@ ever touch@@ eth the mount shall be surely put to death :
thou shalt not bow down thy@@ self to them , nor serve them : for I the LORD thy God am a jeal@@ ous God , visiting the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me ;
if he came in by himself , he shall go out by himself : if he were married , then his wife shall go out with him .
if his master have given him a wife , and she have born him sons or daughters ; the wife and her children shall be her master 's , and he shall go out by himself .
if she please not her master , who hath bet@@ ro@@ thed her to himself , then shall he let her be re@@ deemed : to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power , seeing he hath dealt dece@@ it@@ fully with her .
and thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves , and six curtains by themselves , and shalt double the sixth curtain in the forefront of the tab@@ ern@@ acle .
take heed to thy@@ self , lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whi@@ ther thou go@@ est , lest it be for a sn@@ are in the midst of thee :
and he coupled five curtains by themselves , and six curtains by themselves .
and the priest that off@@ er@@ eth any man 's burnt offering , even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered .
and Moses said unto Aaron , Go unto the altar , and offer thy sin offering , and thy burnt offering , and make an at@@ onement for thy@@ self , and for the people : and offer the offering of the people , and make an at@@ onement for them ; as the LORD commanded .
Aaron therefore went unto the altar , and sle@@ w the cal@@ f of the sin offering , which was for himself .
and when he that hath an issue is cleans@@ ed of his issue ; then he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing , and wash his clothes , and ba@@ the his flesh in running water , and shall be clean .
but if she be cleans@@ ed of her issue , then she shall number to herself seven days , and after that she shall be clean .

def@@ ile not ye yourselves in any of these things : for in all these the nations are de@@ filed which I cast out before you :
therefore shall ye keep mine ordin@@ ance , that ye commit not any one of these ab@@ om@@ in@@ able customs , which were committed before you , and that ye def@@ ile not yourselves therein : I am the LORD your God .
thou shalt not av@@ enge , nor bear any gr@@ udge against the children of thy people , but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy@@ self : I am the LORD .
but the stranger that dwell@@ eth with you shall be unto you as one born among you , and thou shalt love him as thy@@ self ; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt : I am the LORD your God .
a jub@@ ile shall that fif@@ ti@@ eth year be unto you : ye shall not sow , neither reap that which grow@@ eth of itself in it , nor gather the grapes in it of thy vine und@@ ressed .
and if the man have none to re@@ deem it , and himself be able to re@@ deem it ;
for all the fir@@ st@@ born of the children of Israel are mine , both man and beast : on the day that I smo@@ te every fir@@ st@@ born in the land of Egypt I sancti@@ fied them for myself .
and I will come down and talk with thee there : and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee , and will put it upon them ; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee , that thou bear it not thy@@ self alone .
and the people stood up all that day , and all that night , and all the next day , and they gathered the qu@@ ails : he that gathered least gathered ten hom@@ ers : and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp .
seem@@ eth it but a small thing unto you , that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel , to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tab@@ ern@@ acle of the LORD , and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them ?

and do ye abide without the camp seven days : wh@@ oso@@ ever hath killed any person , and wh@@ oso@@ ever hath touched any sl@@ ain , puri@@ fy both yourselves and your cap@@ tives on the third day , and on the seventh day .
the rev@@ enger of blood himself shall sl@@ ay the murderer : when he me@@ et@@ eth him , he shall sl@@ ay him .
only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves , and the spoil of the cities which we took .
take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves ; for ye saw no manner of simil@@ itude on the day that the LORD sp@@ ake unto you in H@@ ore@@ b out of the midst of the fire :
take heed unto yourselves , lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God , which he made with you , and make you a gra@@ ven image , or the lik@@ eness of any thing , which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee .
thou shalt not bow down thy@@ self unto them , nor serve them : for I the LORD thy God am a jeal@@ ous God , visiting the ini@@ qu@@ ity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me ,
for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God : the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself , above all people that are upon the face of the earth .
hear , O Israel : thou art to pass over Jordan this day , to go in to possess nations greater and mi@@ gh@@ tier than thy@@ self , cities great and f@@ enced up to heaven ,
take heed to yourselves , that your heart be not deceived , and ye turn aside , and serve other gods , and worship them ;
then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you , and ye shall possess greater nations and mi@@ gh@@ tier than yourselves .
take heed to thy@@ self that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou se@@ est :
take heed to thy@@ self that thou for@@ sake not the Lev@@ ite as long as thou liv@@ est upon the earth .
for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God , and the LORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself , above all the nations that are upon the earth .
but he shall not multiply horses to himself , nor cause the people to return to Egypt , to the end that he should multiply horses : for@@ as@@ much as the LORD hath said unto you , Y@@ e shall h@@ ence@@ forth return no more that way .
neither shall he multiply wives to himself , that his heart turn not away : neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold .
the LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself , as he hath sworn unto thee , if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God , and walk in his ways .
and Joshua said unto the people , Sanc@@ ti@@ fy yourselves : for to mor@@ row the LORD will do wonders among you .
only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves , according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua .

and he struck it into the pan , or kettle , or cal@@ dr@@ on , or pot ; all that the fl@@ esh@@ hook brought up the priest took for himself . so they did in Sh@@ il@@ oh unto all the Israel@@ ites that came thi@@ ther .
and he said , This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you : he will take your sons , and appoint them for himself , for his ch@@ ari@@ ots , and to be his hor@@ sem@@ en ; and some shall run before his ch@@ ari@@ ots .
for thou hast confirmed to thy@@ self thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever : and thou , LORD , art become their God .
otherwise I should have wrought false@@ hood against mine own life : for there is no matter hid from the king , and thou thy@@ self w@@ oul@@ dest have set thy@@ self against me .
I go the way of all the earth : be thou strong therefore , and sh@@ ew thy@@ self a man ;
and God said unto him , Because thou hast asked this thing , and hast not asked for thy@@ self long life ; neither hast asked riches for thy@@ self , nor hast asked the life of th@@ ine enemies ; but hast asked for thy@@ self understanding to discern judgment ;
and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated , and the things which himself had dedicated , into the house of the LORD , silver , and gold , and vessels .
so they divided the land between them to pass throughout it : A@@ hab went one way by himself , and Ob@@ adi@@ ah went another way by himself .
and Elijah said unto the prophets of Ba@@ al , Choose you one bul@@ lock for yourselves , and dress it first ; for ye are many ; and call on the name of your gods , but put no fire under .
but he himself went a day 's journey into the wilderness , and came and sat down under a j@@ uni@@ per tree : and he requested for himself that he might die ; and said , It is enough ; now , O LORD , take away my life ; for I am not better than my fathers .
and as thy servant was busy here and there , he was gone . and the king of Israel said unto him , So shall thy judgment be ; thy@@ self hast decided it .
Se@@ est thou how A@@ hab hum@@ bl@@ eth himself before me ? because he hum@@ bl@@ eth himself before me , I will not bring the evil in his days : but in his son 's days will I bring the evil upon his house .
in his days E@@ dom revol@@ ted from under the hand of Jud@@ ah , and made a king over themselves .
so they feared the LORD , and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places , which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places .
and this shall be a sign unto thee , Y@@ e shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves , and in the second year that which spring@@ eth of the same ; and in the third year sow ye , and reap , and plant vineyards , and eat the fruits thereof .
but hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel , and hast made Jud@@ ah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a wh@@ oring , like to the wh@@ ore@@ doms of the house of A@@ hab , and also hast sl@@ ain thy brethren of thy father 's house , which were better than thy@@ self :
and said unto them , He@@ ar me , ye Lev@@ ites , sancti@@ fy now yourselves , and sancti@@ fy the house of the LORD God of your fathers , and carry forth the fil@@ thiness out of the holy place .
now be ye not sti@@ ff@@ nec@@ ked , as your fathers were , but yield yourselves unto the LORD , and enter into his sanctuary , which he hath sancti@@ fied for ever : and serve the LORD your God , that the fierc@@ eness of his wrath may turn away from you .
after these things , and the establishment thereof , Sen@@ n@@ ach@@ eri@@ b king of As@@ sy@@ ria came , and entered into Jud@@ ah , and enc@@ amped against the f@@ enced cities , and thought to win them for himself .

and hum@@ bled not himself before the LORD , as Man@@ as@@ se@@ h his father had hum@@ bled himself ; but Am@@ on t@@ resp@@ assed more and more .
and afterward they made ready for themselves , and for the priests : because the priests the sons of Aaron were busi@@ ed in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night ; therefore the Lev@@ ites prepared for themselves , and for the priests the sons of Aaron .
for the priests and the Lev@@ ites were purified together , all of them were pure , and killed the pas@@ sover for all the children of the cap@@ tivity , and for their brethren the priests , and for themselves .
for they have taken of their daughters for themselves , and for their sons : so that the holy seed have ming@@ led themselves with the people of those lands : ye@@ a , the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this t@@ resp@@ ass .
then I consulted with myself , and I rebu@@ ked the no@@ bles , and the rulers , and said unto them , Y@@ e exact us@@ ury , every one of his brother . and I set a great assembly against them .
then Mor@@ dec@@ ai commanded to answer Es@@ ther , Th@@ ink not with thy@@ self that thou shalt escape in the king 's house , more than all the Jews .
to confirm these days of Pur@@ im in their times appointed , according as Mor@@ dec@@ ai the Jew and Es@@ ther the queen had enjo@@ ined them , and as they had decre@@ ed for themselves and for their seed , the matters of the fast@@ ings and their cry .
with kings and counsel@@ lers of the earth , which built des@@ ol@@ ate places for themselves ;
hast thou heard the secret of God ? and d@@ ost thou restrain wisdom to thy@@ self ?
and be it indeed that I have er@@ red , mine error remain@@ eth with myself .
whom I shall see for myself , and mine eyes shall behold , and not another ; though my re@@ ins be consumed within me .
can a man be profitable unto God , as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself ?
acqu@@ aint now thy@@ self with him , and be at peace : thereby good shall come unto thee .
in the dark they dig through houses , which they had marked for themselves in the daytime : they know not the light .
behold , all ye yourselves have seen it ; why then are ye thus altogether vain ?
if I rejo@@ iced at the destruction of him that hated me , or lifted up myself when evil found him :
if he set his heart upon man , if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath ;
what time she lif@@ t@@ eth up herself on high , she scor@@ neth the horse and his ri@@ der .
the fl@@ akes of his flesh are joined together : they are firm in themselves ; they C@@ AN@@ NOT be moved .
when he ra@@ is@@ eth up himself , the mighty are afraid : by reason of break@@ ings they puri@@ fy themselves .
but know that the LORD hath set apart him that is go@@ dly for himself : the LORD will hear when I call unto him .
arise , O LORD , in th@@ ine anger , lift up thy@@ self because of the rage of mine enemies : and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded .
why stand@@ est thou af@@ ar off , O LORD ? why hi@@ dest thou thy@@ self in times of trouble ?
thou hast seen it ; for thou be@@ hol@@ dest mis@@ chief and spite , to requ@@ ite it with thy hand : the poor commit@@ t@@ eth himself unto thee ; thou art the hel@@ per of the fa@@ ther@@ less .
stir up thy@@ self , and awake to my judgment , even unto my cause , my God and my Lord .
for he fl@@ atter@@ eth himself in his own eyes , until his ini@@ qu@@ ity be found to be h@@ ateful .
fre@@ t not thy@@ self because of ev@@ il@@ do@@ ers , neither be thou en@@ vious against the workers of ini@@ qu@@ ity .
delight thy@@ self also in the LORD ; and he shall give thee the desires of th@@ ine heart .
cease from anger , and for@@ sake wrath : fre@@ t not thy@@ self in any wise to do evil .
and if he come to see me , he spe@@ ak@@ eth van@@ ity : his heart gather@@ eth ini@@ qu@@ ity to itself ; when he go@@ eth abroad , he tell@@ eth it .
though while he lived he blessed his soul : and men will praise thee , when thou do@@ est well to thy@@ self .
so they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves : all that see them shall flee away .
and the viney@@ ard which thy right hand hath planted , and the branch that thou mad@@ est strong for thy@@ self .
let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand , upon the son of man whom thou mad@@ est strong for thy@@ self .
who said , Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession .
ye@@ a , the spar@@ row hath found an house , and the swallow a nest for herself , where she may lay her young , even th@@ ine al@@ t@@ ars , O LORD of hosts , my King , and my God .
and of Z@@ ion it shall be said , This and that man was born in her : and the highest himself shall establish her .
lift up thy@@ self , thou judge of the earth : render a reward to the proud .
surely I have behaved and qui@@ eted myself , as a child that is we@@ an@@ ed of his mother : my soul is even as a we@@ an@@ ed child .
his enemies will I clo@@ the with shame : but upon himself shall his crown flourish .
for the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself , and Israel for his peculiar treasure .
his own ini@@ qu@@ ities shall take the wicked himself , and he shall be Hol@@ den with the cor@@ ds of his sins .
if thou be wise , thou shalt be wise for thy@@ self : but if thou scor@@ nest , thou alone shalt bear it .
the liberal soul shall be made fat : and he that water@@ eth shall be wat@@ ered also himself .
he that is desp@@ ised , and hath a servant , is better than he that hon@@ ou@@ re@@ th himself , and l@@ ack@@ eth bread .
the back@@ slider in heart shall be filled with his own ways : and a good man shall be satisfied from himself .
the LORD hath made all things for himself : ye@@ a , even the wicked for the day of evil .
he that lab@@ ou@@ re@@ th lab@@ ou@@ re@@ th for himself ; for his mouth cra@@ v@@ eth it of him .
prepare thy work without , and make it fit for thy@@ self in the field ; and afterwards build th@@ ine house .
debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself ; and discover not a secret to another :
wh@@ os@@ o bo@@ ast@@ eth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain .
boast not thy@@ self of to mor@@ row ; for thou know@@ est not what a day may bring forth .
wh@@ oso@@ ever hi@@ det@@ h her hi@@ det@@ h the wind , and the o@@ int@@ ment of his right hand , which be@@ w@@ ra@@ y@@ eth itself .
the rod and re@@ proof give wisdom : but a child left to himself br@@ ing@@ eth his mother to shame .
if thou hast done fool@@ ishly in lifting up thy@@ self , or if thou hast thought evil , lay th@@ ine hand upon thy mouth .
moreover the profit of the earth is for all : the king himself is served by the field .
in that day a man shall cast his idols of silver , and his idols of gold , which they made each one for himself to worship , to the mol@@ es and to the b@@ ats ;
the sh@@ ew of their coun@@ tenance do@@ th witness against them ; and they declare their sin as So@@ dom , they hide it not . w@@ oe unto their soul ! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves .
therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign ; Be@@ hold , a virgin shall conceive , and bear a son , and shall call his name Im@@ manuel .
what hast thou here ? and whom hast thou here , that thou hast he@@ wed thee out a se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re here , as he that he@@ w@@ eth him out a se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re on high , and that grav@@ eth an hab@@ itation for himself in a rock ?
and this shall be a sign unto thee , Y@@ e shall eat this year such as grow@@ eth of itself ; and the second year that which spring@@ eth of the same : and in the third year sow ye , and reap , and plant vineyards , and eat the fruit thereof .
this people have I formed for myself ; they shall sh@@ ew forth my praise .
he bur@@ neth part thereof in the fire ; with part thereof he e@@ at@@ eth flesh ; he ro@@ ast@@ eth ro@@ ast , and is satisfied : ye@@ a , he war@@ met@@ h himself , and sa@@ ith , A@@ ha , I am warm , I have seen the fire :
I have sworn by myself , the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness , and shall not return , That unto me every knee shall bow , every tongue shall swear .
they st@@ oop , they bow down together ; they could not deliver the burden , but themselves are gone into cap@@ tivity .
against whom do ye sport yourselves ? against whom make ye a wide mouth , and draw out the tongue ? are ye not children of trans@@ g@@ ression , a seed of false@@ hood ,
and thou w@@ ent@@ est to the king with o@@ int@@ ment , and did@@ st increase thy perf@@ umes , and did@@ st send thy messengers far off , and did@@ st deb@@ ase thy@@ self even unto hell .
ye@@ a , truth fail@@ eth ; and he that depart@@ eth from evil mak@@ eth himself a prey : and the LORD saw it , and it dis@@ pleased him that there was no judgment .
and there is none that call@@ eth upon thy name , that stir@@ re@@ th up himself to take hold of thee : for thou hast hid thy face from us , and hast consumed us , because of our ini@@ qu@@ ities .
which say , Stand by thy@@ self , come not near to me ; for I am hol@@ ier than thou . these are a smoke in my nose , a fire that bur@@ neth all the day .
hast thou not proc@@ ured this unto thy@@ self , in that thou hast for@@ s@@ aken the LORD thy God , when he led thee by the way ?
O LORD , I know that the way of man is not in himself : it is not in man that wal@@ ket@@ h to direct his steps .
for the LORD of hosts , that planted thee , hath pronounced evil against thee , for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Jud@@ ah , which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering inc@@ ense unto Ba@@ al .
shall a man make gods unto himself , and they are no gods ?
thus sa@@ ith the LORD ; Take heed to yourselves , and bear no burden on the sab@@ bath day , nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem ;
but if ye will not hear these words , I swear by myself , sa@@ ith the LORD , that this house shall become a des@@ ol@@ ation .
but know ye for certain , that if ye put me to death , ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves , and upon this city , and upon the inhabitants thereof : for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears .
and their no@@ bles shall be of themselves , and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them ; and I will cause him to draw near , and he shall approach unto me : for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me ? sa@@ ith the LORD .
and see@@ k@@ est thou great things for thy@@ self ? seek them not : for , behold , I will bring evil upon all flesh , sa@@ ith the LORD : but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whi@@ ther thou go@@ est .
O thou sword of the LORD , how long will it be ere thou be quiet ? put up thy@@ self into thy S@@ cab@@ bard , rest , and be still .
for I have sworn by myself , sa@@ ith the LORD , that Bo@@ z@@ rah shall become a des@@ ol@@ ation , a repro@@ ach , a waste , and a curse ; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes .
Damascus is wa@@ xed fee@@ ble , and tur@@ neth herself to flee , and fear hath seized on her : angu@@ ish and sor@@ rows have taken her , as a woman in trav@@ ail .
their tents and their f@@ locks shall they take away : they shall take to themselves their curtains , and all their vessels , and their cam@@ els ; and they shall cry unto them , Fe@@ ar is on every side .
the LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself , saying , Su@@ rely I will fill thee with men , as with cat@@ er@@ pill@@ ers ; and they shall lift up a shout against thee .
when they stood , these stood ; and when they were lifted up , these lifted up themselves also : for the spirit of the living creature was in them .
and the lik@@ eness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Che@@ bar , their appearances and themselves : they went every one straight forward .
then say thou , Th@@ us sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D , The city sh@@ ed@@ det@@ h blood in the midst of it , that her time may come , and mak@@ eth idols against herself to def@@ ile herself .
therefore thus sa@@ ith the Lord GO@@ D ; Because thou hast lifted up thy@@ self in height , and he hath shot up his top among the thick b@@ ough@@ s , and his heart is lifted up in his height ;
and ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things : but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves .
the priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself , or torn , whether it be f@@ owl or beast .

for they are gone up to As@@ sy@@ ria , a wild ass alone by himself : E@@ ph@@ ra@@ im hath hired lovers .
sow to yourselves in righteousness , reap in mercy ; break up your f@@ allow ground : for it is time to seek the LORD , till he come and rain righteousness upon you .
but ye have borne the tab@@ ern@@ acle of your Molo@@ ch and Chi@@ un your images , the star of your god , which ye made to yourselves .
the Lord GO@@ D hath sworn by himself , sa@@ ith the LORD the God of hosts , I abh@@ or the excell@@ ency of Jacob , and hate his palaces : therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein .
and it came to pass , when the sun did arise , that God prepared a ve@@ h@@ ement east wind ; and the sun beat upon the head of Jon@@ ah , that he fain@@ ted , and wished in himself to die , and said , It is better for me to die than to live .
they are terrible and dreadful : their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves .
this shall they have for their pride , because they have repro@@ ached and magni@@ fied themselves against the people of the LORD of hosts .
and I answered again , and said unto him , What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves ?
and when ye did eat , and when ye did drink , did not ye eat for yourselves , and drink for yourselves ?
and think not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
that th@@ ine al@@ ms may be in secret : and thy Father which se@@ eth in secret himself shall reward thee openly .
lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth , where moth and r@@ ust do@@ th corrupt , and where thieves break through and steal :
take therefore no thought for the mor@@ row : for the mor@@ row shall take thought for the things of itself . sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof .
and , behold , certain of the scri@@ bes said within themselves , This man bl@@ asph@@ em@@ eth .
for she said within herself , If I may but touch his garment , I shall be whole .
and Jesus knew their thoughts , and said unto them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to des@@ ol@@ ation ; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand :
and if Satan cast out Satan , he is divided against himself ; how shall then his kingdom stand ?
then go@@ eth he , and tak@@ eth with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter in and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first . even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation .

and they reasoned among themselves , saying , It is because we have taken no bread .
honour thy father and thy mother : and , Th@@ ou shalt love thy neighbour as thy@@ self .
the baptism of John , wh@@ ence was it ? from heaven , or of men ? and they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say unto us , Why did ye not then believe him ?
but when the Hus@@ band@@ men saw the son , they said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and let us seize on his inheritance .
and the second is like unto it , Th@@ ou shalt love thy neighbour as thy@@ self .
and wh@@ oso@@ ever shall ex@@ alt himself shall be ab@@ ased ; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted .
w@@ oe unto you , scri@@ bes and Pharis@@ ees , hypo@@ crit@@ es ! for ye compass sea and land to make one pro@@ sel@@ yte , and when he is made , ye make him tw@@ of@@ old more the child of hell than yourselves .
W@@ herefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves , that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets .
but the wise answered , saying , Not so ; lest there be not enough for us and you : but go ye rather to them that sell , and buy for yourselves .
he saved others ; himself he C@@ AN@@ NOT save . if he be the King of Israel , let him now come down from the cross , and we will believe him .
when the even was come , there came a rich man of Ari@@ ma@@ th@@ a@@ ea , named Joseph , who also himself was Jesus ' disciple :
and they were all amazed , in@@ som@@ uch that they questioned among themselves , saying , What thing is this ? what new doctrine is this ? for with authority comman@@ det@@ h he even the un@@ clean spirits , and they do obey him .
and immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves , he said unto them , Why reason ye these things in your hearts ?
and when his friends heard of it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said , He is beside himself .
and if a kingdom be divided against itself , that kingdom C@@ AN@@ NOT stand .
and if a house be divided against itself , that house C@@ AN@@ NOT stand .
and if Satan rise up against himself , and be divided , he C@@ AN@@ NOT stand , but hath an end .
and have no root in themselves , and so endure but for a time : afterward , when afflic@@ tion or persecution ar@@ is@@ eth for the word 's sake , immediately they are offended .
and Jesus , immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him , turned him about in the press , and said , Who touched my clothes ?
and king Her@@ od heard of him ; ( for his name was spread abroad : ) and he said , That John the Baptist was risen from the dead , and therefore mighty works do sh@@ ew forth themselves in him .
for Her@@ od himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John , and bound him in prison for Her@@ odi@@ as ' sake , his brother Philip 's wife : for he had married her .
and he said unto them , Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place , and rest a while : for there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat .
and he went up unto them into the ship ; and the wind ceased : and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure , and wondered .
and they reasoned among themselves , saying , It is because we have no bread .
and after six days Jesus tak@@ eth with him Peter , and James , and John , and lead@@ eth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves : and he was trans@@ figured before them .
and suddenly , when they had looked round about , they saw no man any more , save Jesus only with themselves .
and they kept that saying with themselves , questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean .
and he came to Cap@@ ern@@ au@@ m : and being in the house he asked them , What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way ?
salt is good : but if the salt have lost his sal@@ tness , where@@ with will ye season it ? have salt in yourselves , and have peace one with another .
and they were astonished out of measure , saying among themselves , Who then can be saved ?
and they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why then did ye not believe him ?
but those Hus@@ band@@ men said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and the inheritance shall be ours .
and the second is like , namely this , Th@@ ou shalt love thy neighbour as thy@@ self . there is none other commandment greater than these .
and to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbour as himself , is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices .
David therefore himself call@@ eth him Lord ; and wh@@ ence is he then his son ? and the common people heard him gladly .

likewise also the chief priests mo@@ cking said among themselves with the scri@@ bes , He saved others ; himself he C@@ AN@@ NOT save .
and after those days his wife Elis@@ abeth conceived , and hid herself five months , saying ,
bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and begin not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
and he said unto them , Y@@ e will surely say unto me this prover@@ b , Phys@@ ician , heal thy@@ self : whatsoever we have heard done in Cap@@ ern@@ au@@ m , do also here in thy country .
and they were all amazed , and sp@@ ake among themselves , saying , What a word is this ! for with authority and power he comman@@ det@@ h the un@@ clean spirits , and they come out .
and Jesus answering them said , Have ye not read so much as this , what David did , when himself was an hun@@ g@@ red , and they which were with him ;
but the Pharis@@ ees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves , being not baptized of him .
now when the Pharis@@ ee which had bid@@ den him saw it , he sp@@ ake within himself , saying , This man , if he were a prophet , would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touch@@ eth him : for she is a sinner .
and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves , Who is this that for@@ gi@@ v@@ eth sins also ?
after these things the Lord appointed other seventy also , and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place , whi@@ ther he himself would come .
and he answering said , Th@@ ou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy strength , and with all thy mind ; and thy neighbour as thy@@ self .
but he , knowing their thoughts , said unto them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to des@@ ol@@ ation ; and a house divided against a house fall@@ eth .
if Satan also be divided against himself , how shall his kingdom stand ? because ye say that I cast out dev@@ ils through Be@@ el@@ ze@@ bu@@ b .
then go@@ eth he , and tak@@ eth to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself ; and they enter in , and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first .
and he thought within himself , saying , What shall I do , because I have no room where to best@@ ow my fruits ?
so is he that lay@@ eth up treasure for himself , and is not rich toward God .
and that servant , which knew his lord 's will , and prepared not himself , neither did according to his will , shall be beaten with many stri@@ pes .
for wh@@ oso@@ ever exal@@ t@@ eth himself shall be ab@@ ased ; and he that hum@@ bl@@ eth himself shall be exalted .
and when he came to himself , he said , How many hired servants of my father 's have bread enough and to spare , and I perish with hunger !
then the ste@@ ward said within himself , What shall I do ? for my lord tak@@ eth away from me the stewardship : I C@@ AN@@ NOT dig ; to beg I am ashamed .
take heed to yourselves : if thy brother t@@ resp@@ ass against thee , rebu@@ ke him ; and if he repent , forgive him .
and will not rather say unto him , Make ready where@@ with I may su@@ p , and gir@@ d thy@@ self , and serve me , till I have eaten and drun@@ ken ; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink ?
and he would not for a while : but afterward he said within himself , Th@@ ough I fear not God , nor regard man ;
and he sp@@ ake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and desp@@ ised others :
the Pharis@@ ee stood and prayed thus with himself , God , I thank thee , that I am not as other men are , extor@@ tion@@ ers , unjust , adul@@ ter@@ ers , or even as this public@@ an .
I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other : for every one that exal@@ t@@ eth himself shall be ab@@ ased ; and he that hum@@ bl@@ eth himself shall be exalted .
he said therefore , A certain no@@ bl@@ eman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom , and to return .
and they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why then believed ye him not ?
but when the Hus@@ band@@ men saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , This is the heir : come , let us kill him , that the inheritance may be ours .
and take heed to yourselves , lest at any time your hearts be over@@ charged with sur@@ fe@@ iting , and drun@@ ken@@ ness , and cares of this life , and so that day come upon you un@@ awa@@ res .
and he took the cup , and gave thanks , and said , Take this , and divide it among yourselves :
and they began to inqu@@ ire among themselves , which of them it was that should do this thing .
and they began to accuse him , saying , We found this fellow perver@@ ting the nation , and forbid@@ ding to give tribute to Caes@@ ar , saying that he himself is Christ a King .
and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Her@@ od 's jurisdiction , he sent him to Her@@ od , who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time .
and the same day Pil@@ ate and Her@@ od were made friends together : for before they were at enmity between themselves .
but Jesus turning unto them said , Dau@@ ghters of Jerusalem , we@@ ep not for me , but we@@ ep for yourselves , and for your children .
and one of the mal@@ e@@ factors which were han@@ ged rail@@ ed on him , saying , If thou be Christ , save thy@@ self and us .
then arose Peter , and ran unto the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re ; and sto@@ oping down , he be@@ held the linen clothes laid by themselves , and departed , wondering in himself at that which was come to pass .
and beginning at Moses and all the prophets , he exp@@ ounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself .
then said they unto him , Who art thou ? that we may give an answer to them that sent us . what say@@ est thou of thy@@ self ?
art thou greater than our father Jacob , which gave us the well , and drank thereof himself , and his children , and his cattle ?
and said unto the woman , Now we believe , not because of thy saying : for we have heard him ourselves , and know that this is indeed the Christ , the Saviour of the world .
then answered Jesus and said unto them , Ver@@ ily , verily , I say unto you , The Son can do nothing of himself , but what he se@@ eth the Father do : for what things soever he do@@ eth , these also do@@ eth the Son likewise .
for as the Father hath life in himself ; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself ;
if I bear witness of myself , my witness is not true .
and the Father himself , which hath sent me , hath borne witness of me . ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his shape .
when Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force , to make him a king , he departed again into a mountain himself alone .
Jesus therefore answered and said unto them , Mur@@ mur not among yourselves .
the Jews therefore stro@@ ve among themselves , saying , How can this man give us his flesh to eat ?
when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples mur@@ mu@@ red at it , he said unto them , do@@ th this offend you ?
if any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of God , or whether I speak of myself .
he that spe@@ ak@@ eth of himself see@@ ket@@ h his own glory : but he that see@@ ket@@ h his glory that sent him , the same is true , and no un@@ righteousness is in him .
then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught , saying , Y@@ e both know me , and ye know wh@@ ence I am : and I am not come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye know not .
then said the Jews among themselves , whi@@ ther will he go , that we shall not find him ? will he go unto the dispersed among the Genti@@ les , and teach the Genti@@ les ?
so when they continued asking him , he lifted up himself , and said unto them , He that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at her .
when Jesus had lifted up himself , and saw none but the woman , he said unto her , Woman , where are those th@@ ine acc@@ users ? hath no man condemned thee ?
the Pharis@@ ees therefore said unto him , Th@@ ou be@@ arest record of thy@@ self ; thy record is not true .
Jesus answered and said unto them , Th@@ ough I bear record of myself , yet my record is true : for I know wh@@ ence I came , and whi@@ ther I go ; but ye C@@ AN@@ NOT tell wh@@ ence I come , and whi@@ ther I go .
I am one that bear witness of myself , and the Father that sent me be@@ areth witness of me .
then said Jesus unto them , When ye have lifted up the Son of man , then shall ye know that I am he , and that I do nothing of myself ; but as my Father hath taught me , I speak these things .
Jesus said unto them , If God were your Father , ye would love me : for I proceeded forth and came from God ; neither came I of myself , but he sent me .
but by what means he now se@@ eth , we know not ; or who hath opened his eyes , we know not : he is of age ; ask him : he shall speak for himself .
no man tak@@ eth it from me , but I lay it down of myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . this commandment have I received of my Father .
the Pharis@@ ees therefore said among themselves , perceive ye how ye prevail nothing ? behold , the world is gone after him .
for I have not spoken of myself ; but the Father which sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
if God be glori@@ fied in him , God shall also glori@@ fy him in himself , and shall strai@@ gh@@ tw@@ ay glori@@ fy him .
and if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and receive you unto myself ; that where I am , there ye may be also .
Beli@@ ev@@ est thou not that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself : but the Father that dwell@@ eth in me , he do@@ eth the works .
abide in me , and I in you . as the branch C@@ AN@@ NOT bear fruit of itself , except it abide in the vine ; no more can ye , except ye abide in me .
How@@ be@@ it when he , the Spirit of truth , is come , he will guide you into all truth : for he shall not speak of himself ; but whatsoever he shall hear , that shall he speak : and he will sh@@ ew you things to come .
and now come I to thee ; and these things I speak in the world , that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves .
Jesus answered him , say@@ est thou this thing of thy@@ self , or did others tell it thee of me ?
and the n@@ ap@@ kin , that was about his head , not lying with the linen clothes , but wrapped together in a place by itself .
ye men of Israel , hear these words ; Jesus of Naz@@ areth , a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs , which God did by him in the midst of you , as ye yourselves also know :
for David is not asc@@ ended into the heavens : but he sa@@ ith himself , The LORD said unto my Lord , S@@ it thou on my right hand ,
but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves ,
and said unto them , Y@@ e men of Israel , take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men .
but there was a certain man , called Simon , which be@@ fore@@ time in the same city used sor@@ cery , and be@@ wit@@ ched the people of Sam@@ aria , giving out that himself was some great one :
and the e@@ un@@ uch answered Philip , and said , I pray thee , of whom spe@@ ak@@ eth the prophet this ? of himself , or of some other man ?
now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean , behold , the men which were sent from Corn@@ eli@@ us had made inquiry for Simon 's house , and stood before the gate ,
nevertheless he left not himself without witness , in that he did good , and gave us rain from heaven , and fruitful seasons , filling our hearts with food and gl@@ ad@@ ness .
and Jud@@ as and Sil@@ as , being prophets also themselves , ex@@ hor@@ ted the brethren with many words , and confirmed them .
but none of these things move me , neither count I my life dear unto myself , so that I might finish my course with joy , and the ministry , which I have received of the Lord Jesus , to testify the gospel of the grace of God .
take heed therefore unto yourselves , and to all the flock , over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you over@@ se@@ ers , to feed the church of God , which he hath purchased with his own blood .
and they came to the chief priests and elders , and said , We have bound ourselves under a great curse , that we will eat nothing until we have sl@@ ain Paul .
commanding his acc@@ users to come unto thee : by examining of whom thy@@ self may@@ est take knowledge of all these things , where@@ of we accuse him .
then Paul , after that the governor had bec@@ k@@ oned unto him to speak , answered , for@@ as@@ much as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation , I do the more cheer@@ fully answer for myself :
but F@@ est@@ us answered , that Paul should be kept at Caes@@ area , and that he himself would depart shortly thi@@ ther .
then A@@ gri@@ pp@@ a said unto Paul , Th@@ ou art permitted to speak for thy@@ self . then Paul stretched forth the hand , and answered for himself :
I think myself happy , king A@@ gri@@ pp@@ a , because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things where@@ of I am accused of the Jews :
I verily thought with myself , that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Naz@@ areth .
and as he thus sp@@ ake for himself , F@@ est@@ us said with a loud voice , Paul , thou art beside thy@@ self ; much learning do@@ th make thee mad .
and when they were gone aside , they talked between themselves , saying , This man do@@ eth nothing worthy of death or of bonds .
and when the bar@@ b@@ arians saw the ven@@ om@@ ous beast hang on his hand , they said among themselves , No doubt this man is a murderer , whom , though he hath escaped the sea , yet vengeance suffer@@ eth not to live .
and when we came to Rome , the cent@@ ur@@ ion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard : but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him .
and when they agreed not among themselves , they departed , after that Paul had spoken one word , Well sp@@ ake the Holy Ghost by Es@@ ai@@ as the prophet unto our fathers ,
and when he had said these words , the Jews departed , and had great reasoning among themselves .
W@@ herefore God also gave them up to un@@ clean@@ ness through the lu@@ sts of their own hearts , to dis@@ honour their own bodies between themselves :
and likewise also the men , leaving the natural use of the woman , burned in their lust one toward another ; men with men working that which is un@@ seem@@ ly , and receiving in themselves that re@@ comp@@ ence of their error which was meet .
and not only they , but ourselves also , which have the fir@@ st@@ fruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves gro@@ an within ourselves , waiting for the adoption , to w@@ it , the redemption of our body .
for I could wish that myself were accur@@ sed from Christ for my brethren , my kin@@ smen according to the flesh :
but what sa@@ ith the answer of God unto him ? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men , who have not bowed the knee to the image of Ba@@ al .
dearly beloved , av@@ enge not yourselves , but rather give place unto wrath : for it is written , Ven@@ ge@@ ance is mine ; I will repay , sa@@ ith the Lord .
so then every one of us shall give account of himself to God .
I know , and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus , that there is nothing un@@ clean of itself : but to him that este@@ em@@ eth any thing to be un@@ clean , to him it is un@@ clean .
hast thou faith ? have it to thy@@ self before God . happy is he that condem@@ neth not himself in that thing which he allow@@ eth .
for even Christ pleased not himself ; but , as it is written , The repro@@ aches of them that repro@@ ached thee fell on me .
that ye receive her in the Lord , as becom@@ eth saints , and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you : for she hath been a succ@@ ou@@ rer of many , and of myself also .
if any man 's work shall be burned , he shall suffer loss : but he himself shall be saved ; yet so as by fire .
for I know nothing by myself ; yet am I not hereby justified : but he that jud@@ get@@ h me is the Lord .
but them that are without God jud@@ get@@ h . therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person .
know ye not that the un@@ righteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God ? be not deceived : neither for@@ nic@@ ators , nor id@@ ol@@ aters , nor adul@@ ter@@ ers , nor eff@@ em@@ inate , nor ab@@ users of themselves with mankind ,
judge in yourselves : is it com@@ ely that a woman pray unto God uncovered ?
but let a man examine himself , and so let him eat of that bread , and drink of that cup .
for he that e@@ at@@ eth and drin@@ ket@@ h un@@ worth@@ ily , e@@ at@@ eth and drin@@ ket@@ h dam@@ nation to himself , not discer@@ ning the Lord 's body .
charity suffer@@ eth long , and is kind ; charity envi@@ eth not ; charity v@@ aun@@ t@@ eth not itself , is not pu@@ ffed up ,
but we had the sentence of death in ourselves , that we should not trust in ourselves , but in God which ra@@ is@@ eth the dead :
but I determined this with myself , that I would not come again to you in heav@@ iness .
not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves ; but our sufficiency is of God ;
for we preach not ourselves , but Christ Jesus the Lord ; and ourselves your servants for Jesus ' sake .
for we comm@@ end not ourselves again unto you , but give you occasion to glory on our behalf , that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance , and not in heart .
for whether we be beside ourselves , it is to God : or whether we be sober , it is for your cause .
and that he died for all , that they which live should not h@@ ence@@ forth live unto themselves , but unto him which died for them , and rose again .
for we dare not make ourselves of the number , or compare ourselves with some that comm@@ end themselves : but they measuring themselves by themselves , and comparing themselves among themselves , are not wise .
for not he that comm@@ en@@ det@@ h himself is approved , but whom the Lord comm@@ en@@ det@@ h .
and no mar@@ vel ; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light .
for ye suffer fo@@ ols gladly , seeing ye yourselves are wise .
for all the law is fulfilled in one word , even in this ; Th@@ ou shalt love thy neighbour as thy@@ self .
for if a man think himself to be something , when he is nothing , he decei@@ v@@ eth himself .
but let every man prove his own work , and then shall he have rejo@@ icing in himself alone , and not in another .
having made known unto us the mystery of his will , according to his good pleasure which he hath pur@@ posed in himself :
for by grace are ye saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves : it is the gift of God :
having abolished in his flesh the enmity , even the law of commandments contained in ordin@@ ances ; for to make in himself of tw@@ ain one new man , so making peace ;
and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets , Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone ;
from whom the whole body fit@@ ly joined together and comp@@ acted by that which every joint suppl@@ i@@ eth , according to the effec@@ tual working in the measure of every part , mak@@ eth increase of the body unto the edi@@ fying of itself in love .
and walk in love , as Christ also hath loved us , and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet@@ sm@@ elling sav@@ our .
speaking to yourselves in p@@ sal@@ ms and hym@@ ns and spiritual songs , singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord ;
that he might present it to himself a glorious church , not having spot , or wrink@@ le , or any such thing ; but that it should be holy and without bl@@ emish .
nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself ; and the wife see that she reverence her husband .
let nothing be done through strife or v@@ ain@@ glory ; but in low@@ liness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves .
but I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly .
who shall change our v@@ ile body , that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body , according to the working whereby he is able even to sub@@ due all things unto himself .
for yourselves , brethren , know our entrance in unto you , that it was not in vain :
now God himself and our Father , and our Lord Jesus Christ , direct our way unto you .
but as touching bro@@ ther@@ ly love ye need not that I write unto you : for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another .
for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout , with the voice of the ar@@ chang@@ el , and with the trump of God : and the dead in Christ shall rise first :
and to esteem them very highly in love for their work 's sake . and be at peace among yourselves .
see that none render evil for evil unto any man ; but ever follow that which is good , both among yourselves , and to all men .
now our Lord Jesus Christ himself , and God , even our Father , which hath loved us , and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace ,
for yourselves know how ye ought to follow us : for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you ;
now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means . the Lord be with you all .
take heed unto thy@@ self , and unto the doctrine ; continue in them : for in doing this thou shalt both save thy@@ self , and them that hear thee .
one of themselves , even a prophet of their own , said , The Cre@@ tians are al@@ way li@@ ars , evil beasts , slow bel@@ lies .
who gave himself for us , that he might re@@ deem us from all ini@@ qu@@ ity , and puri@@ fy unto himself a peculiar people , z@@ eal@@ ous of good works .
if thou count me therefore a partner , receive him as myself .
and by reason here@@ of he ought , as for the people , so also for himself , to offer for sins .
and no man tak@@ eth this honour unto himself , but he that is called of God , as was Aaron .
so also Christ glori@@ fied not himself to be made an high priest ; but he that said unto him , Th@@ ou art my Son , to day have I be@@ gotten thee .
for when God made promise to Abraham , because he could swear by no greater , he sw@@ are by himself ,
who need@@ eth not daily , as those high priests , to offer up sacrifice , first for his own sins , and then for the people 's : for this he did once , when he offered up himself .
but into the second went the high priest alone once every year , not without blood , which he offered for himself , and for the errors of the people :
for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself .
not for@@ s@@ aking the assembling of ourselves together , as the manner of some is ; but ex@@ hor@@ ting one another : and so much the more , as ye see the day approaching .
for ye had compassion of me in my bonds , and took joy@@ fully the spo@@ iling of your goods , knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance .
for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself , lest ye be wear@@ ied and faint in your minds .
remember them that are in bonds , as bound with them ; and them which suffer ad@@ versity , as being yourselves also in the body .
are ye not then partial in yourselves , and are become judges of evil thoughts ?
if ye fulfil the royal law according to the scrip@@ ture , Th@@ ou shalt love thy neighbour as thy@@ self , ye do well :
and above all things have ferv@@ ent charity among yourselves : for charity shall cover the multitude of sins .
but there were false prophets also among the people , even as there shall be false teachers among you , who priv@@ ily shall bring in dam@@ n@@ able here@@ sies , even denying the Lord that bought them , and bring upon themselves swift destruction .
he that sa@@ ith he ab@@ id@@ eth in him ought himself also so to walk , even as he walked .
and every man that hath this hope in him puri@@ fi@@ eth himself , even as he is pure .
he that believ@@ eth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself : he that believ@@ eth not God hath made him a li@@ ar ; because he believ@@ eth not the record that God gave of his Son .
we know that wh@@ oso@@ ever is born of God sin@@ neth not ; but he that is be@@ gotten of God keep@@ eth himself , and that wicked one touch@@ eth him not .
look to yourselves , that we lose not those things which we have wrought , but that we receive a full reward .
but ye , beloved , building up yourselves on your most holy faith , praying in the Holy Ghost ,
