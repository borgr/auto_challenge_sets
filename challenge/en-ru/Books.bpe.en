Leo Tolstoy
all H@@ AP@@ P@@ Y families resemble one another , but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way .
everything was upset in the O@@ bl@@ on@@ sk@@ ys ' house .
the wife had discovered an intri@@ gue between her husband and their former French govern@@ ess , and declared that she would not continue to live under the same roof with him .
'@@ Let me see what was it ? ' he thought , trying to recall his dream .
his eyes spark@@ led mer@@ r@@ ily and he smiled as he sat thinking .
'@@ Yes , it was very nice .
there were many other delightful things which I can '@@ t just get hold of - can '@@ t catch now I 'm awake . '
and then he suddenly remembered that , and why , he was not sleeping there but in his study . the smile vanished from his face and he fro@@ w@@ ned .
'@@ Oh dear , dear , dear ! ' he gro@@ an@@ ed recalling what had happened .
and the details of his quarrel with his wife , his inextr@@ icable position , and , worst of all , his guilt , rose up in his imagination .
'@@ no , she will never forgive me ; she can '@@ t forgive me !
that 's the tragedy of it ! ' he thought . ' Oh dear , oh dear ! ' he mut@@ tered des@@ pair@@ ingly , as he recalled the most painful details of the quarrel .
she sat there : the care@@ worn , ever @@@ -@@ @ bust@@ ling , and ( as he thought ) rather simple Dol@@ ly - with the note in her hand and a look of terror , despair , and anger on her face .
'@@ What is this ? this ? ' she asked , pointing to the note .
and , as often happens , it was not so much the memory of the event that tor@@ m@@ ented him , as of the way he had replied to her .
he could not forgive himself for that silly smile .
Dol@@ ly , seeing it , sh@@ ud@@ dered as if with physical pain , and with her usual ve@@ hem@@ ence burst into a tor@@ rent of cruel words and rushed from the room .
since then she had refused to see him .
'@@ It 's all the fault of that stupid smile , ' thought O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . '
but what am I to do ? what can I do ? ' he asked himself in despair , and could find no answer .
he was incapable of self @@@ -@@ @ deception and could not persuade himself that he rep@@ ented of his conduct .
he could not feel repent@@ ant that he , a handsome am@@ orous man of thirty @@@ -@@ @ four , was not in love with his wife , the mother of five living and two dead children and only a year younger than himself .
he rep@@ ented only of not having managed to conceal his conduct from her .
nevertheless he felt his unhappy position and p@@ iti@@ ed his wife , his children , and himself .
he might perhaps have been able to hide things from her had he known that the knowledge would so distress her .
he had never clearly considered the matter , but had a vague notion that his wife had long suspected him of being un@@ faithful and win@@ ked at it .
of course it 's not quite nice that she had been a govern@@ ess in our house .
( he vivi@@ dly pic@@ tured to himself M@@ l@@ le Rol@@ and 's ro@@ gu@@ ish black eyes , and her smile . )
'@@ Be@@ sides , as long as she was in the house I never took any liberties .
why need it all happen at once ?
what am I to do ? '
he could find no answer , except life 's usual answer to the most complex and in@@ soluble questions .
that answer is : live in the needs of the day , that is , find for@@ get@@ fulness .
he could no longer find for@@ get@@ fulness in sleep , at any rate not before night , could not go back to the music and the songs of the little dec@@ an@@ ter @@@ -@@ @ women , consequently he must seek for@@ get@@ fulness in the dream of life .
the bell was answered immediately by his old friend and val@@ et , Matthew , who brought in his clothes , boots , and a tel@@ eg@@ ram .
he was followed by the bar@@ ber with sha@@ ving tackle .
'@@ Any papers from the Office ? ' asked O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , as he took the tel@@ eg@@ ram and sat down before the looking @@@ -@@ @ glass .
'@@ They 're on your table , ' answered Matthew with a questioning and sympath@@ izing glance at his master - adding after a pause with a sly smile : ' some one has called from the job@@ master 's . '
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky did not answer , but glanced at Matthew 's face in the looking @@@ -@@ @ glass . from their looks , as they met in the glass , it was evident that they understood one another .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's look seemed to say : ' why do you tell me that ? as if you don '@@ t know ! '
Matthew put his hands into the pocket of his jacket , put out his foot , and looked at his master with a slight , good @@@ -@@ @ Hum@@ oured smile .
'@@ i ordered him to come the Sunday after next , and not to trouble you or himself need@@ lessly till then , ' said he , evidently repeating a sentence he had prepared .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky understood that Matthew meant to have a joke and draw attention to himself .
he t@@ ore open the tel@@ eg@@ ram and read it , gu@@ essing at the words , which ( as so often happens in tele@@ grams ) were mis@@ sp@@ elt , and his face bri@@ ghtened .
'@@ Matthew , my sister Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna is coming to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row , ' he said , mo@@ tioning away for a moment the shiny pl@@ ump hand of the bar@@ ber , which was sha@@ ving a rosy path between his long cur@@ ly whis@@ kers .
'@@ is she coming alone , or with Mr. K@@ aren@@ in ? '
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky could not answer as the bar@@ ber was busy with his upper lip ; but he raised one finger , and Matthew nodded to him in the glass .
'@@ Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na ? ' Matthew repeated , as if in doubt .
give her the tel@@ eg@@ ram , and see what she says . '
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky was washed , his hair br@@ ushed , and he was about to dress , when Matthew , stepping slowly in his cre@@ aking boots , re @@@ -@@ @ entered the room with the tel@@ eg@@ ram in his hand .
the bar@@ ber was no longer there .
" he may do as he pleas@@ es " - that is , as you please , sir , ' he said , laughing with his eyes only ; and , putting his hands in his pockets , with his head on one side , he gaz@@ ed at his master .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky remained silent , then a kind and rather pathetic smile appeared on his handsome face .
'@@ ah , Matthew ! ' he said , shaking his head .
'@@ Never mind , sir - things will shape themselves . '
'@@ Just so , sir . '
'@@ Do you think so ? - Who 's that ? ' asked O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , hearing the ru@@ st@@ le of a woman 's dress outside the door .
'@@ It 's me , sir , ' answered a firm and pleasant woman 's voice , and Mat@@ ren@@ a Fil@@ im@@ on@@ ovna , the children 's nurse thrust her stern po@@ ck@@ marked face in at the door .
'@@ What is it , Mat@@ ren@@ a ? ' asked O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , stepping out to her .
'@@ What is it ? ' said he mour@@ n@@ fully .
'@@ W@@ on '@@ t you go and try again , sir ?
she suffers dread@@ fully ; it 's p@@ iti@@ ful to see her , and everything in the house is top@@ sy @@@ -@@ @ tur@@ vy .
you should consider the children !
'@@ But she won '@@ t admit me ! '
'@@ Do your part - God is mer@@ ciful .
pray to Him , sir , pray to Him ! '
'@@ all right - now go , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , suddenly bl@@ ushing . ' I must get dressed , ' said he , turning to Matthew , and he resolutely threw off his dressing @@@ -@@ @ g@@ own .
Matthew blew some invisible spec@@ k off the shirt which he held ready gathered up like a horse 's collar , and with evident pleasure invested with it his master 's carefully tended body .
this forest had to be sold ; but until he was reconciled with his wife the sale was quite out of the question .
what was most unpleasant was that a financial consideration would now be mixed up with the impending reconciliation .
the idea that he might be biased by that consideration , might seek a reconciliation in order to sell the forest , offended him .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky subscri@@ bed to and read a Liberal paper - not an extreme Liberal paper but one that expressed the opinions of the majority .
the Liberal Party maintained that everything in Russia was bad , and it was a fact that O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky had many debts and deci@@ dedly too little money .
the Liberal Party said that marriage was an obsolete institution which ought to be reformed ; and family life really gave O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky very little pleasure , forcing him to tell lies and dissem@@ ble , which was quite contrary to his nature .
thus Liber@@ alism became habitual to O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , and he loved his paper as he loved his after @@@ -@@ @ dinner ci@@ gar , for the slight M@@ ist@@ iness it produced in his brain .
he also read the finance article in which Ben@@ th@@ am and Mill were mentioned and hits were made at the Ministry .
but that joyful smile at once brought everything back to his mind , and he grew thoughtful .
then he heard the sound of two chil@@ dish voices outside the door , and recognized them as the voices of his el@@ dest daughter , T@@ anya , and of his little boy G@@ ris@@ ha .
'@@ i told you not to put passengers on the roof , ' the girl shouted in English . ' now pick them up ! '
'@@ Everything is dis@@ organized , ' thought O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky ; ' here are the children running wild - ' and going to the door he called them in .
the girl , her father 's pet , ran boldly in , embraced him , and hung laughing on his neck , pleased , as she always was , to smell the familiar scent of his whis@@ kers .
having kis@@ sed his face , fl@@ ushed by sto@@ oping and lit up by ten@@ derness , the girl un@@ cl@@ as@@ ped her hands and was going to run away , but he held her back .
'@@ How 's M@@ ama ? ' he asked , passing his hand over his daughter 's smooth delicate little neck , as he smil@@ ingly said ' Good morning ' in answer to the little boy 's greeting .
he was conscious of not caring as much for the boy as for the girl but did his best to treat them both alike . the boy felt this and did not respond to his father 's cold smile .
'@@ That means that she has again not slept all night , ' he thought .
he noticed this and bl@@ ushed too .
'@@ i don '@@ t know , ' she said . ' she said we were not to have any lessons , but must walk with Miss H@@ ull to Grand@@ mam@@ ma 's . '
'@@ Well you may go , my little T@@ any@@ akin ...
Oh , wait ! ' he said , still holding her and stro@@ king her delicate little hand .
'@@ For G@@ ris@@ ha ? ' she asked , holding out the chocolate .
'@@ Yes , yes , ' and stro@@ king her shoulder he kis@@ sed her hair at the roots and her neck , and let her go .
'@@ the carriage is ready , ' said Matthew , ' and there is a woman on business waiting for you . '
'@@ But I must give you time to finish your coffee , ' answered Matthew in his friendly ru@@ de tone , with which it was impossible to be angry .
'@@ Well , ask her in at once , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , his face wrink@@ ling with v@@ ex@@ ation .
having dismissed her , he took his hat and paused to consider whether he had forgotten anything .
he found he had forgotten nothing but what he wanted to forget : his wife .
his head dropped , and his handsome face became worried .
nothing except hypocrisy and false@@ hood could now result - and these were repu@@ gn@@ ant to his nature .
'@@ N@@ evertheless it will have to be done sooner or later . after all , things can '@@ t remain as they are , ' he said , trying to br@@ ace himself .
he expanded his chest , took out a cigarette , lit it , took two whi@@ ffs , then threw it into a pear@@ l @@@ -@@ @ shell ash @@@ -@@ @ tray , and crossing the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room with rapid steps , he opened the door which led into his wife 's bedroom .
hearing her husband 's step she stopped and looked at the door , v@@ ain@@ ly trying to assume a severe and cont@@ emp@@ tuous expression .
she felt that she was afraid of him and afraid of the impending interview .
she pressed her lips together and a cheek @@@ -@@ @ muscle t@@ wit@@ ched on the right side of her pale nervous face .
'@@ What do you want ? ' she said quickly in a voice unlike her usual deep tones .
'@@ Dol@@ ly , ' he repeated un@@ steadily , ' Anna is coming to @@@ -@@ @ day . '
'@@ Go away , go away , go away ! ' she cried , as if in physical pain , without looking at him .
you know ... ' He could not continue . his throat was cho@@ ked with so@@ bs .
'@@ Dol@@ ly , what can I say ? ...
think , nine years ... Can '@@ t they at@@ one for a mom@@ entary - a mom@@ entary ... '
her eyes dro@@ op@@ ed and she waited to hear what he would say , as if entre@@ ating him to persuade her somehow that she had made a mistake .
'@@ Go away - go away from here ! ' she cried in a still shr@@ iller voice , ' and don '@@ t talk to me of your inf@@ at@@ u@@ ations and all those horrors ! '
she wished to go away , but stagg@@ ered and held on to the back of a chair to support herself .
his face broad@@ ened , his lips sw@@ elled , and his eyes filled with tears .
'@@ Dol@@ ly ! ' he said , now actually so@@ b@@ bing , ' for heaven 's sake think of the children - they have done nothing !
I am the guilty one .
I have no words to express my guilt ...
she sat down and he could hear her loud , heavy breathing . he felt un@@ utter@@ ably sorry for her .
she tried again and again to speak and could not .
but she had spoken of ' our children , ' and looking grat@@ efully at her he moved to take her hand ; but she stepped aside with a look of repu@@ gn@@ ance .
tell me , do you think it possible for us to live together after what has happened ?
is it possible ?
say , is it possible ? ' she repeated , raising her voice . ' when my husband , the father of my children , has love affairs with his children 's govern@@ ess ? '
'@@ But what 's to be done ? - what 's to be done ? ' said he , in a pit@@ eous voice , hardly knowing what he was saying , and sinking his head lower and lower .
'@@ You are hor@@ rid and disgu@@ sting to me ! ' she shouted , getting more and more excited . ' your tears are - water !
to me you are det@@ est@@ able , disgu@@ sting - a stranger , yes , a perfect stranger ! ' she uttered that word stranger , so terrible to herself , with angu@@ ish and hatred .
he did not understand that his pity ex@@ as@@ per@@ ated her .
she saw in him pity for herself but not love .
'@@ It is awful , awful ! ' he mut@@ tered .
at that moment a child began to cry in another room , probably having tum@@ bled down . Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na listened , and her face sof@@ tened suddenly .
she seemed to be trying to recoll@@ ect herself , as if she did not know where she was or what she had to do . then she rose quickly and moved toward the door .
'@@ After all , she loves my child , ' he thought , noticing the change in her face when the baby cried ; ' my child - then how can she hate me ? '
'@@ Dol@@ ly , just a word ! ' he said , following her .
'@@ If you follow me , I shall call the servants and the children !
I 'll let everybody know you are a s@@ coun@@ dre@@ l !
I am going away to @@@ -@@ @ day , and you may live here with your mistress ! '
she went out , s@@ lam@@ ming the door .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky sigh@@ ed , wiped his face , and with soft steps left the room .
'@@ Matthew says " things will shape themselves , " - but how ?
and her shouting - it was so vulgar , ' he thought , recalling her scre@@ ams and the words s@@ coun@@ dre@@ l and mistress . ' and the m@@ aids may have heard it !
it is dread@@ fully ban@@ al , dread@@ fully ! '
for a few seconds O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky stood alone ; then he wiped his eyes , sigh@@ ed , and expanding his chest went out of the room .
that 's a good phrase , ' he thought . ' I must use that . '
'@@ Matthew ! ' he called , ' will you and Mary arrange everything for Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna in the little sitting @@@ -@@ @ room ? ' he added when Matthew appeared .
'@@ i 'll see ...
'@@ En@@ ough or not , we shall have to manage , that 's clear , ' said Matthew , closing the carriage door and stepping back into the por@@ ch .
'@@ is it possible that he still sees her ?
why did@@ n '@@ t I ask him ?
Oh , no ! it 's impossible to be re@@ united ...
how I loved - and don '@@ t I love him now ?
Don '@@ t I love him more than ever ?
the most terrible thing ... ' She did not finish the thought , because Mat@@ ren@@ a Fil@@ im@@ on@@ ovna thrust her head in at the door .
'@@ all right ! I 'll come and see about it in a moment ...
and Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na plunged into her daily cares , and for a time drowned her grief in them .
here he is ! ' said almost every one he met , smil@@ ingly .
it was the third year that O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky had been Head of that Government Board in Moscow , and he had won not only the affection but also the respect of his fellow @@@ -@@ @ officials , subordin@@ ates , chiefs , and all who had anything to do with him .
having arrived at his destination , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky ; respec@@ tfully followed by the door @@@ -@@ @ keeper bearing his portfolio , entered his little private room , put on his uniform , and came out into the Office .
the cler@@ ks and attend@@ ants all rose and bowed cheer@@ fully and respec@@ tfully .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky walked quickly , as was his won@@ t , to his place , shook hands with the Members , and sat down .
he chat@@ ted and jo@@ ked just as much as was proper and then turned to business .
no one could determine better than he the limits of freedom , simplicity , and form@@ ality , necessary for the pleasant transaction of business .
the Secretary came up with the papers , cheer@@ fully and respec@@ tfully like everybody in O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's Office , and remarked in the famili@@ arly Liberal tone introduced by O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky :
'@@ G@@ ot it at last ? ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , holding this paper down with his finger . ' well , gentlemen ... ' and the sitting commenced .
till two o 'clock the business was to continue un@@ interrup@@ tedly , but at two there was to be an ad@@ journ@@ ment for lunch .
it was not quite two when the large glass doors suddenly swung open and some one came in .
when the Report had been read , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky rose , stretching himself , and , paying tribute to the Liber@@ alism of the times , took out a cigarette before leaving the Office to go to his private room .
'@@ We shall have time to finish after lunch , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ Pl@@ enty of time ' said Nik@@ iti@@ n .
'@@ He must be a precious rogue , that F@@ om@@ in , ' said Gr@@ inev@@ ich , referring to one of those concerned in the case under consideration .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky made a face at these words , thereby indicating that it is not right to form an opinion pre@@ mat@@ urely , and did not reply .
'@@ Who was it came in ? ' he asked the door @@@ -@@ @ keeper .
'@@ Some man came in without permission , your Excell@@ ency , when I was@@ n '@@ t looking .
'@@ Per@@ haps he has gone out into the hall ; he was walking about there just now .
his kindly face , be@@ aming over the gold @@@ -@@ @ embroi@@ dered collar of his uniform , grew still more radiant when he recognized the man who was coming up .
'@@ Yes , it 's he !
'@@ i 've only just arrived , and am very anxious to see you , ' answered Levin , looking round with constraint , and yet cros@@ sly and un@@ easily .
'@@ Well then , come into my room , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , who knew his friend 's self @@@ -@@ @ conscious and irrit@@ able sh@@ y@@ ness ; and seizing him by the arm he led him along as if past some danger .
Levin and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky were almost of the same age ; and with Levin , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky was on familiar terms not through champagne only .
Levin had been his com@@ rade and friend in early youth , and they were fond of one another as friends who have come together in early youth often are , in spite of the difference in their characters and tastes .
yet , as often happens between men who have chosen different pursu@@ its , each , while in argument justi@@ fying the other 's activity , desp@@ ised it in the depth of his heart .
each thought that his own way of living was real life , and that the life of his friend was - illusion .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky could not re@@ press a slightly sar@@ cas@@ tic smile at the sight of Levin .
how many times he had already seen him arriving in Moscow from the country , where he did something , though what it was O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky could never quite understand or feel any interest in .
Levin came to Moscow always excited , always in a hurry , rather shy and irrit@@ ated by his own sh@@ y@@ ness , and usually with totally new and unexpected views about things .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky laughed at all this , and yet liked it .
similarly , Levin in his heart desp@@ ised the town life his friend was leading , and his official duties which he considered futile and ridicul@@ ed .
but the difference was that O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , doing as every one else did , laughed with confidence and good hum@@ our , while Levin laughed un@@ certainly and sometimes an@@ gr@@ ily .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky at once noticed Levin 's look and smiled .
'@@ Very pleased ... ' said the old official ..
'@@ i have the honour of knowing your brother , Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich , ' said Gr@@ inev@@ ich , holding out his narrow hand with the long finger@@ nails .
Levin fro@@ w@@ ned , shook hands col@@ dly , and immediately turned to O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ no , I am no longer on the Zem@@ st@@ vo - I have quar@@ rel@@ led with the lot of them , and don '@@ t attend their meetings any more , ' said he , addressing his friend .
'@@ Quick work ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , with a smile . ' what was it all about ? '
I see you 've reached another new phase - a Conservative one this time ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . ' however , we 'll talk about that later . '
but I want to see you , ' said Levin , gaz@@ ing with aver@@ sion at Gr@@ inev@@ ich 's hand .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's smile was hardly percep@@ tible .
it was so strange to see that intelligent man@@ ly face in such a chil@@ dish condition that O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky left off looking at him .
'@@ Where shall we see one another ?
you know it is very , very important for me to have a talk with you , ' said Levin .
'@@ Well - suppose we go to lunch at Gur@@ in 's and have a talk there ?
'@@ no , ' said Levin , after a moment 's consideration ; ' I have to go somewhere else . '
'@@ Well then , let 's dine together . '
'@@ D@@ ine ?
'@@ Well , tell me the word or two now , and we 'll talk at dinner . '
'@@ the two words are ... however , it 's nothing particular , ' said Levin , and his face became almost vicious in his efforts to overcome his sh@@ y@@ ness .
'@@ What are the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys doing ?
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , who had long known that Levin was in love with his , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's , sister @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law Kit@@ ty , smiled very slightly and his eyes spark@@ led mer@@ r@@ ily .
'@@ You spoke of two words , but I can '@@ t answer in two because ...
Levin , who during O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's talk with the Secretary had quite overcome his sh@@ y@@ ness , stood leaning both arms on the back of a chair and listening with ir@@ on@@ ical attention .
'@@ i don '@@ t understand it at all ! ' he remarked .
'@@ What don '@@ t you understand ? ' asked O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky with his usual mer@@ ry smile , as he took out a cigarette .
he expected Levin to say something ec@@ centric .
'@@ i don '@@ t understand what you 're doing , ' said Levin sh@@ ru@@ gging his shoulders . ' how can you do it seriously ? '
'@@ Why not ? '
'@@ Because there 's nothing to do ! '
'@@ Per@@ haps ! ' said Levin . ' but all the same I admire your dignity and am proud that my friend is such a great man !
but all the same you 've not answered my question , ' he added , making a desperate effort to look O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky straight in the face .
it 's all very well for you , who have three thousand des@@ y@@ at@@ ins in the Kar@@ az@@ in District , and such muscles , and are as fresh as a twelve @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old girl ! but still , you 'll be joining us yourself some day ! ...
now , about what you were asking : nothing has changed , but it 's a pity you 've stopped away so long . '
'@@ Oh , nothing - ' answered O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . ' we 'll talk it over later on .
but what has brought you here specially ? '
'@@ We 'll talk about that too later on , ' said Levin and again bl@@ ushed to his very ears .
'@@ all right , that 's natural enough ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . ' well , you know , I 'd ask you to come to us , but my wife is not very well .
let 's see , - if you want to meet them , you 'll be sure to find them in the Zo@@ ological Gardens from four to five .
go there , and I 'll call for you and we 'll dine somewhere together . '
'@@ Mind you don '@@ t forget ! I know you - you may rush off back to the country ! ' shouted O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky after him .
'@@ That 'll be all right ! ' said Levin and left the room , only recoll@@ ecting when already at the door that he had not taken leave of O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's colleagues .
'@@ He seems a very energetic man , ' said Gr@@ inev@@ ich when Levin was gone .
'@@ Yes , my dear fellow , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , shaking his head , ' and he 's a lucky man !
three thousand des@@ y@@ at@@ ins in the Kar@@ az@@ in District , his life before him , and such fresh@@ ness !
'@@ What have you to complain of , Stephen Ark@@ ady@@ evich ? '
'@@ Oh , things are w@@ ret@@ ched , miserable ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , and sigh@@ ed heavily .
the Lev@@ ins and the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys were two old arist@@ ocratic Moscow families that had always been on intimate and friendly terms .
their ties were drawn still closer during Levin 's University days .
he had prepared for and entered the University together with young Prince Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky , Dol@@ ly 's and Kit@@ ty 's brother .
at that time Levin often visited the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys , and fell in love with the family .
strange as it may seem , it was the whole Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky family - especially the feminine half of it - that Levin was in love with .
in his student days he very nearly fell in love with the el@@ dest daughter , Dol@@ ly ; but a marriage was soon after arranged between her and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
he seemed to feel that he must fall in love with one of the sisters , but he was not sure with which .
but Nat@@ aly too , as soon as she came out , married the diplomat , L@@ vo@@ v .
Kit@@ ty was still a child when Levin finished at the University .
young Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky who entered the navy was drowned in the Baltic ; and after that , in spite of his friendship with O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , Levin 's intercourse with the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys became less frequent .
but when he had come to Moscow early in the winter of this year and met them , he knew at last which of the three sisters he was really f@@ ated to love .
Levin 's conviction that it was impossible rested on the idea that from her relatives ' point of view he was not a good or suitable match for the delightful Kit@@ ty , and that Kit@@ ty herself could not love him .
of course the mysterious , enchan@@ ting Kit@@ ty could not love a plain fellow , such as he considered himself to be , a man so ordinary and un@@ distinguished .
moreover , his former relation to Kit@@ ty had been that of a grown @@@ -@@ @ up man towards a child whose brother 's friend he was , and this seemed an additional obstacle in love 's path .
he had heard that women often love plain ordinary men but he did not believe it , because he judged by himself and he could only love beautiful mysterious exceptional women .
so he had now come to Moscow determined to propose to her , and to marry her if he was accepted .
or ... but he dared not think what would happen if she refused him .
but his brother was not alone . a well @@@ -@@ @ known professor of philosophy was with him , who had come specially from Kharkov to settle a dispute that had arisen between them on an important philosophical question .
the question was the fashionable one , whether a definite line exists between psychological and physiological phenomena in human activity ; and if so , where it lies ?
when Levin entered , Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich greeted him with the col@@ dly aff@@ able smile he bestowed on everybody and , having introduced him to the professor , went on with the discussion .
the small spectac@@ led man with the narrow forehead interrupted the conversation a moment to say , ' how do you do ' to Levin and , paying no further attention to him , went on talking .
Levin sat down to wait till the professor should go , but soon became interested in the subject of their conversation .
the most fundamental perception - that of existence - is not received through the senses , for there is no special organ to convey that perception . '
'@@ Yes , but they ( W@@ ur@@ st and K@@ na@@ ust and Pri@@ pas@@ ov ) will tell you that your conception of existence results from the collective effect of all your sensations and is therefore a result of sensations .
W@@ ur@@ st actually says that without the senses there can be no perception of existence . '
'@@ i would maintain the opposite ... ' began Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev .
but here again it seemed to Levin that having reached the most important matter they avoided it ; and he made up his mind to ask the professor a question .
'@@ Con@@ sequ@@ ently , if my senses are destroyed , if my body dies , no further existence is possible ? ' he asked .
'@@ That question we have as yet no right to decide ... '
Levin listened no longer but sat waiting for the professor to go .
when THE professor H@@ AD G@@ ONE , Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev turned to his step @@@ -@@ @ brother .
'@@ i am very glad you have come .
Levin knew that farming did not interest his elder brother and that the question was merely a concession , therefore he replied generally as to the sale of wheat and money matters .
he felt that his brother would not look at the matter as he wished him to .
'@@ Well , and how is your Zem@@ st@@ vo getting on ? ' asked Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , who took a keen interest in the rural administration and attached great importance to it .
'@@ no , I am no longer on it . I resigned , ' answered Levin , ' and don '@@ t attend the Meetings any more . '
'@@ That 's a pity ! ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , and fro@@ w@@ ned .
to justify himself Levin began to relate what used to happen at the Meetings in his district .
'@@ We Russians are always like that . it may be a good trait in us - this capacity to see our own faults - but we over@@ do it , and comfort ourselves with sar@@ cas@@ m , which is always ready on our tongues .
I can only tell you , that with such rights as we have in our rural institutions , any other European nation - the English or the Germans - would have secured their freedom , while we only je@@ er at our Zem@@ st@@ vo@@ s ! '
'@@ But what is to be done ? ' said Levin guil@@ tily . ' that was my last attempt .
and I tried with my whole soul .
'@@ In@@ capable ! ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev . ' no , you don '@@ t look at it from the right point of view . '
'@@ That may be , ' said Levin mour@@ n@@ fully .
'@@ Do you know that our brother Nicholas is here again ? '
'@@ You don '@@ t mean to say so ! ' cried Levin , horror @@@ -@@ @ struck .
'@@ How do you know ? '
'@@ Pro@@ k@@ of@@ y met him in the street . '
'@@ Here , in Moscow ?
do you know ? ' Levin rose from his chair as if meaning to go at once .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev took a note from under a paper @@@ -@@ @ weight and handed it to his brother .
Levin read the note , written in a curious but familiar hand : ' I hum@@ bly beg you to leave me alone .
that is all I demand of my dear brothers . - Nicholas Levin . '
when Levin had read the note , holding it in his hand , he remained standing in front of Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev without lifting his head .
a struggle was going on within him between the desire to forget his unfortunate brother for the present , and the consciousness that this would be wrong .
'@@ He evidently wants to offend me , ' continued Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , ' but he C@@ AN@@ NOT do that . I wish with all my heart I could help him , but I know it can '@@ t be done . '
'@@ Yes , yes , ' said Levin , ' I understand , and appreciate your attitude toward him ; but personally I shall go to see him . '
'@@ It may be impossible to help him , but I feel - especially at this moment ... but that 's a different matter - I feel that I C@@ AN@@ NOT be at peace ... '
'@@ Well , I don '@@ t understand that , ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev . ' but what I do understand is a lesson in humility .
I have begun to look differently , more len@@ i@@ ently , at what is called r@@ asc@@ ality , since brother Nicholas became what he is .
do you know what he has done ? '
'@@ ah , it 's dreadful , dreadful ! ' Levin repeated .
having got the address from Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev 's foot@@ man Levin thought of going at once to see his brother ; but , on reflection , decided to put off the visit till the evening .
to obtain peace of mind it was necessary first of all to decide the business that had brought him to Moscow .
he therefore went to O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's office , and having received news of the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys he drove to the place where he was told he could see Kit@@ ty .
he walked along the path leading to the skating lake , and kept repeating to himself ' I must not be excited .
I must be quiet ! ...
what 's the matter ? be quiet , stupid ! ' he said to his heart .
but the more he tried to be calm , the more lab@@ oured grew his breath .
he met an acquaintance who called to him , but Levin did not even notice who it was .
a few more steps brought him to the skating lake , and among all the skaters he at once recognized her .
she stood talking to a lady at the other end of the lake .
there seemed to be nothing striking in her dress or attitude , but it was as easy for Levin to recognize her in that crowd as to find a rose among net@@ tles .
she was the smile that bri@@ ghtened everything around .
'@@ Can I really step down on to the ice , and go up to her ? ' he thought .
the spot where she stood seemed to him an un@@ appro@@ achable sanctuary , and there was a moment when he nearly went away , he was so filled with awe .
he had to make an effort and reason with himself that all sorts of people were passing near her and he himself might have come just to sk@@ ate .
he stepped down , avoiding any long look at her as one avoids long looks at the sun , but seeing her as one sees the sun , without looking .
on that day of the week and at that hour , people belonging to the same set and acquainted with one another , met on the ice .
yet skaters appeared quite calmly to gain on her , to catch her up , and even speak to her , and quite independently of her to am@@ use themselves enjoying the excellent ice and the fine weather .
Nicholas Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky , Kit@@ ty 's cousin , in a short jacket , tight trous@@ ers , with sk@@ ates on his feet , was sitting on a bench , and seeing Levin , called out to him .
'@@ i haven '@@ t any sk@@ ates , ' answered Levin , wondering at such bold@@ ness and freedom of manner in her presence and not losing sight of her for a moment although not looking at her .
he felt the sun approaching him .
she was not very firm on her feet . having drawn her hands from the mu@@ ff that hung by a cord from her neck , she held them out and looking at Levin , whom she had recognized , she smiled at him and at her fears .
having turned the corner , she pushed off with an elastic little foot , gli@@ ded straight up to Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky , and catching hold of him with her hand , nodded smil@@ ingly to Levin .
she was more beautiful than he had imagined her .
'@@ Have you been here long ? ' she said , shaking hands with him . ' thank you , ' she added as he picked up the hand@@ ker@@ chief she had dropped from her mu@@ ff .
she looked attentively at him as if wishing to understand his confusion .
there is a tradition here that you are the best sk@@ ater , ' she said , fl@@ icking off with a small black @@@ -@@ @ glo@@ ved hand some ho@@ ar @@@ -@@ @ frost crystals that had fallen on her mu@@ ff .
'@@ Yes , I used to be passi@@ on@@ ately fond of skating . I wanted to be perfect at it . '
'@@ You seem to do everything passi@@ on@@ ately , ' she remarked with a smile . ' I should so like to see you sk@@ ate .
put on a pair and let us sk@@ ate together . '
'@@ Sk@@ ate together !
can it be possible ? ' thought Levin looking at her .
'@@ i 'll go and put them on at once , ' he said , and went to hire some sk@@ ates .
is that right ? ' he added , pulling the str@@ ap tight .
'@@ Yes , that 's right , that 's right ! please be quick ! ' answered Levin , trying to restrain the happy smile which appeared on his face .
'@@ Yes , ' he thought , ' this is life - this is joy !
she said , " Tog@@ ether : let us sk@@ ate together " !
shall I tell her now ?
away with this weakness ! '
he approached Kit@@ ty tim@@ idly , but her smile again tranqu@@ illi@@ zed him .
she gave him her hand and they went on together , increasing their speed , and the faster they went the closer she pressed his hands .
'@@ i should learn quicker with you , for some reason - feel confidence in you , ' she said .
'@@ And I am confident of myself when you lean on me , ' he answered , and was immediately frightened of what he had said , and bl@@ ushed .
but I have no right to ask , ' he said hur@@ ri@@ edly .
'@@ Go to her then , she is so fond of you . '
'@@ What does she mean ?
I have hurt her .
help me , O Lord ! ' thought Levin , ha@@ st@@ ening toward the old French@@ woman with the grey cur@@ ls ; who sat on one of the ben@@ ches .
she welcomed Levin as an old friend , showing her set of false teeth in a smile .
'@@ Yes , you see we grow up , ' she said , indicating Kit@@ ty with a glance , ' and grow old .
he had not the fain@@ test recoll@@ ection of it , but she was fond of the joke and had laughed at it for the last ten years .
'@@ Well , go - go and sk@@ ate !
when Levin returned to Kit@@ ty her face was no longer stern and her eyes had their former truthful , kindly look but he thought there was an intentionally quiet manner in her aff@@ ability and he felt sad .
having spoken about her old govern@@ ess and her peculiarities , she asked him about his way of life .
'@@ i don '@@ t feel at all dull , I am very busy , ' he answered , conscious that she was subdu@@ ing him to her quiet tone , from which - as had happened at the beginning of the winter - he would not be able to free himself .
'@@ i don '@@ t know , ' he answered , without thinking of what he was saying .
the idea that if he accepted her tone of calm friend@@ liness he would again go away without having settled anything occurred to him , and he determined to rebel .
it all depends on you , ' he said , and was at once terrified at his own words .
'@@ My God ! what have I done ?
O Lord , help me and teach me ! ' prayed Levin , and feeling at the same time a need of violent exercise , he got up speed and described inner and outer circles .
he then flew down the slope and gli@@ ded along the ice without so much as changing the easy position of his arms .
'@@ Oh , that 's a new trick ! ' said Levin , and at once ran up to try that new trick .
'@@ Don '@@ t hurt yourself - it needs practice ! ' Nicholas Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky called out .
he caught his foot on the last step , but , scarcely touching the ice with his hand , made a violent effort , regained his balance , and sk@@ ated away laughing .
'@@ Good ! dear man ! ' thought Kit@@ ty who at that moment was just coming out of the little house with M@@ l@@ le Lin@@ on , looking at him with a smile of gentle ten@@ derness as at a dear brother .
'@@ Can I really be guilty - have I really done anything wrong ?
they say it 's co@@ qu@@ et@@ ting ...
I know it 's not him I love , but still I feel happy with him , he is so charming !
only why did he say that ? ' she thought .
when he saw Kit@@ ty who was going away , and her mother who had met her on the steps , Levin , fl@@ ushed with the violent exercise , stood still and considered .
he then took off his sk@@ ates and over@@ took mother and daughter at the gates of the Gardens .
'@@ Very pleased to see you , ' said the Princess . ' we are at home on Thur@@ s@@ days , as usual . '
'@@ And to @@@ -@@ @ day is Thursday ! '
'@@ We shall be glad to see you , ' said the Princess dr@@ ily .
Kit@@ ty was sorry to hear that dry tone and could not resist the desire to counteract her mother 's col@@ dness .
she turned her head and said smil@@ ingly :
just then O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , his hat til@@ ted on one side , with radiant face and eyes , walked into the Gardens like a joy@@ ous conqu@@ er@@ or .
but on approaching his mother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law he answered her questions about Dol@@ ly 's health with a sor@@ row@@ ful and guilty air : after a few words with her in a subdued and mour@@ n@@ ful tone , he expanded his chest and took Levin 's arm .
'@@ Well , shall we go ? ' he asked . ' I kept thinking about you , and am very , very glad you 've come , ' he went on , looking significantly into Levin 's eyes .
'@@ Yes , yes ! let 's go , ' answered the happy Levin , still hearing the voice saying : ' AU revo@@ ir ! ' and still seeing the smile with which it had been said .
'@@ the Angl@@ eter@@ re , or the Hermitage ? '
'@@ What ? ' said Levin . ' Tur@@ bot ?
'@@ ah - oy@@ sters ! '
'@@ Sh@@ all we change our plan , Levin ? ' he said , with his finger on the bill of fare and his face expressing serious perpl@@ ex@@ ity . ' but are the oy@@ sters really good ?
'@@ They may be Fl@@ ens@@ burg , but are they fresh ? '
'@@ They only arrived yesterday . '
'@@ Well then , shall we begin with oy@@ sters and change the whole plan of our dinner , eh ? '
'@@ W@@ ould you like buck@@ wheat à la Rus@@ se ? ' said the Tart@@ ar , sto@@ oping over Levin like a nurse over a child .
'@@ no , - jo@@ king apart , whatever you choose will suit me .
I 've been skating and I 'm hungry !
Don '@@ t think that I do not appreciate your choice , ' he added , noticing a dissatisfied look on O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's face .
'@@ i should think so !
say what you like , it is one of the pleasures of life ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . ' well then , my good fellow , bring us two - or that will be too little ... three dozen oy@@ sters , and vegetable soup ... '
but O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky evidently did not wish to give him the pleasure of calling the dishes by their French names .
'@@ What shall we have to drink ? '
'@@ Wh@@ at@@ ever you like , only not too much ... Ch@@ ampagne ! ' said Levin .
however , why not ?
you like the white seal ? '
'@@ Yes , bring us that with the oy@@ sters , and then we 'll see . '
'@@ Yes , sir , and what sort of table wine ? '
'@@ Nu@@ it ... no , let 's have the classic Ch@@ ab@@ lis . '
and your special cheese ? '
'@@ no , I really don '@@ t care , ' said Levin , unable to restrain a smile .
the Tart@@ ar dar@@ ted off , his coat @@@ -@@ @ tails flying ; and five minutes later rushed in again , with a dish of opened oy@@ sters in pe@@ arly shells and a bottle between his fingers .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky crum@@ pled his star@@ ched n@@ ap@@ kin and pushed a corner of it inside his wai@@ st@@ coat , then , with his arms comfortably on the table , attacked the oy@@ sters .
Levin could eat oy@@ sters , though he preferred bread and cheese .
even the Tart@@ ar , who having drawn the cor@@ k and poured the sparkling wine into the thin wide glasses was strai@@ ghtening his white tie , glanced with a smile of evident pleasure at O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ You don '@@ t care much for oy@@ sters ? ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , empt@@ ying his champagne glass - ' or perhaps you 're thinking of something else .
he wanted Levin to be in good spirits .
but Levin , if not exactly in bad spirits , felt constrained .
he was afraid of so@@ iling that which filled his soul .
'@@ Yes , I noticed that poor Gr@@ inev@@ ich 's nails interested you greatly , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ i can '@@ t help it , ' replied Levin . ' put yourself in my place - look at it from a country fellow 's point of view !
we try to get our hands into a state convenient to work with , and for that purpose we cut our nails and sometimes roll up our sle@@ eves .
but here people purpos@@ ely let their nails grow until they begin to cur@@ l , and have little s@@ auc@@ ers for stu@@ ds to make it quite impossible for them to use their hands ! '
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky smiled mer@@ r@@ ily .
'@@ Yes , it is a sign that rough work is unnecessary to him .
'@@ Well , of course , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . ' the aim of civilization is to enable us to get enjoyment out of everything . '
'@@ Well , if that is its aim , I 'd rather be a savage . '
'@@ You are a savage as it is .
he remembered his brother Nicholas and fro@@ w@@ ned , feeling ashamed and distressed ; but O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky started a subject which at once distracted his thoughts .
'@@ Well , are you going to see our people to @@@ -@@ @ night ? the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys , I mean , ' he said , pushing away the rough and now empty oy@@ ster shells and drawing the cheese toward him , while his eyes glit@@ tered significantly .
'@@ Yes , certainly I shall go . though the Princess appeared to ask me rather un@@ willingly . '
'@@ Not a bit of it !
what hum@@ bug !
it 's her gran@@ de d@@ ame manner , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . ' I shall come too , but I must first go to a musical rehear@@ sal at the Countess Bon@@ in 's .
how do you explain your sudden departure from Moscow ?
the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys asked me again and again , just as if I ought to know all about you .
yet all I know is that you never do things as any one else does ! '
'@@ Yes , ' said Levin slowly and with agitation . ' you are right , I am a savage .
only my sav@@ ag@@ ery lies not in having gone away then , but rather in having come back now .
I have now come ... '
'@@ Oh , what a lucky fellow you are ! ' interrupted O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , looking straight into his eyes .
'@@ Why ? '
'@@ no , not behind me , but you have the future and I have the present ; and even that only half @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ half ! '
however , I don '@@ t want to talk about myself , and besides it 's impossible to explain everything , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . ' well , and why have you come to Moscow ? ...
here , take this away ! ' he shouted to the Tart@@ ar .
'@@ Don '@@ t you guess ? ' answered Levin , the light shining deep in his eyes as he gaz@@ ed steadily at O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ i do , but I can '@@ t begin to speak about it , - by which you can judge whether my guess is right or wrong , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , looking at him with a subtle smile .
'@@ Well , and what do you say to it ? ' asked Levin with a trembling voice , feeling that all the muscles of his face were qui@@ vering . ' what do you think of it ? '
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky slowly drank his glass of Ch@@ ab@@ lis , his eyes fixed on Levin .
'@@ There is nothing I should like better , ' said he , ' nothing !
it is the best that could happen . '
'@@ But are you not making a mistake ?
do you know what we are talking about ? ' said Levin , pe@@ ering into his interloc@@ utor 's face . ' you think it possible ? '
'@@ no , do you really think it is possible ?
no , you must tell me all you really think !
'@@ Why do you think so ? ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , smiling at Levin 's excitement .
'@@ Well , sometimes it seems so to me .
you know , that would be terrible both for her and for me . '
'@@ Oh no ! in any case there 's nothing in it terrible for the girl .
'@@ W@@ ait a bit : you must take some sauce , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , stopping Levin 's hand that was pushing away the sauce @@@ -@@ @ boat .
Levin obedi@@ ently helped himself to sauce , but would not let O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky eat .
'@@ no , wait , wait ! ' he said . ' understand that for me it is a question of life and death .
I have never spoken to any one about it , and can speak to no one else about it .
she sees people through and through ! but more than that , she knows what is going to happen especially in regard to marriages .
for instance , she predicted that the Sha@@ hov@@ skaya girl would marry Bren@@ tel@@ n .
no one would believe it , but as it turned out she was right .
and she is on your side . '
'@@ How do you know ? '
'@@ in this way - she not only likes you , but says that Kit@@ ty is sure to be your wife . '
at these words a sudden smile bri@@ ghtened Levin 's face , the kind of smile that is not far from tears of ten@@ derness .
'@@ She says that ? ' he cried . ' I have always thought her a je@@ wel , your wife !
but enough - enough about it ! ' and he got up .
'@@ all right , but sit down ! '
but Levin could not sit still .
he stro@@ de up and down the little cage of a room bl@@ inking to force back his tears , and only when he had succeeded did he sit down again .
'@@ Then why did you go away ? '
you can '@@ t imagine what you have done for me by saying what you did !
I am so happy that I 'm acting mean@@ ly . I 've forgotten everything .
I heard to @@@ -@@ @ day about my brother Nicholas ... he 's here , you know ... and I forgot all about him .
it seems to me as if he too were happy .
it is like madness !
'@@ ah , but all the same , ' said Levin , ' looking back at my life , I trem@@ ble and curse and bit@@ terly regret ...
'@@ What 's to be done ? that 's the way the world is made , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ My one consolation is that prayer that I like so much : " not according to my deserts but according to Th@@ y mercy ! "
Levin emp@@ tied H@@ IS GL@@ ASS and they were silent for a while .
why do you ask ? '
'@@ Another bottle ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , turning to the Tart@@ ar , who was filling their glasses and ho@@ vering round them just when he was not wanted .
'@@ Why do I need to know V@@ ron@@ ski@@ j ? '
'@@ the reason you ought to know V@@ ron@@ sky is this : he is one of your rivals . '
'@@ What is he ? ' asked Levin , the expression of child@@ like rap@@ ture which O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky had been admir@@ ing suddenly changing into an angry and unpleasant one .
'@@ V@@ ron@@ sky is one of Count Cy@@ ril Ivanovich V@@ ron@@ sky 's sons , and a very fine sample of the gil@@ ded youth of Petersburg .
I met him in Tver when I was in the Service there and he came on con@@ scription duty .
and he 's even more than a first @@@ -@@ @ rate fellow .
as I have got to know him now , he turns out to be both educated and very clever - a man who will go far . '
Levin fro@@ w@@ ned and was silent .
'@@ Well , so he came here soon after you left , and as far as I can make out is head over ears in love with Kit@@ ty ; and you understand that her mother ... '
'@@ Par@@ don me , but I understand nothing , ' said Levin , dis@@ m@@ ally knit@@ ting his brows .
and at once he thought of his brother Nicholas and how mean he was to forget him .
Levin le@@ ant back in his chair . his face was pale .
'@@ But I should advise you to settle the question as soon as possible , ' O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky continued , filling Levin 's glass .
'@@ no , thanks ! I can '@@ t drink any more , ' said Levin pushing his glass aside , ' or I shall be ti@@ p@@ sy ...
well , and how are you getting on ? ' he continued , evidently wishing to change the subject .
'@@ You have so often promised to come and shoot with me - why not come this spring ? ' said Levin .
he now rep@@ ented with his whole heart of having begun this conversation with O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
his personal feelings had been des@@ ec@@ rated by the mention of some Petersburg officer as his rival , and by O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's con@@ jec@@ tures and advice .
he understood what was going on in Levin 's soul .
'@@ i 'll come some day , ' he said . ' Ah , old cha@@ p , women are the pivot on which everything turns !
he took out a ci@@ gar , and with one hand on his glass he continued : ' give me some advice . '
'@@ Why ? what is the matter ? '
'@@ Well , it 's this .
sup@@ posing you were married and loved your wife , but had been fascinated by another woman ...
'@@ Exc@@ use me , but really I ... it 's quite incomprehensible to me . it 's as if ... just as incomprehensible as if I , after eating my fill here , went into a b@@ aker 's shop and stole a roll . '
a woman , a dear , gentle , aff@@ ection@@ ate creature , poor and lonely , sacrifices everything .
you know that for me there are two kinds of women ... or rather , no ! there are women , and there are ...
I have never seen any charming fallen creatures , and never shall see any ; and people like that painted French@@ woman with her cur@@ ls out there by the counter , are an ab@@ om@@ ination to me , and all these fallen ones are like her . '
'@@ Oh , don '@@ t !
Christ would never have spoken those words , had he known how they would be mis@@ used !
however , I am not saying what I think , but what I feel .
I have a horror of fallen women .
you are rep@@ elled by sp@@ id@@ ers and I by those creatures .
probably you never studied sp@@ id@@ ers and know nothing of their morals ; and it 's the same in my case ! '
'@@ It 's all very well for you to talk like that - it 's like that gentleman in D@@ ick@@ ens , who with his left hand threw all difficult questions over his right shoulder .
what am I to do ? tell me , what am I to do ?
a man hardly has time to turn round , before he feels that he can no longer love his wife in that way , whatever his regard for her may be .
and then all of a sudden love crosses your path , and you 're lost , lost ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky with despair .
Levin smiled .
'@@ Yes , I am lost , ' continued O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . ' but what am I to do ? '
'@@ Don '@@ t steal rolls . '
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky burst out laughing .
'@@ Oh , you mor@@ alist !
but just consider , here are two women : one insists only on her rights , and her rights are your love , which you C@@ AN@@ NOT give her ; and the other sacrifices herself and demands nothing .
what are you to do ?
'@@ If you want me to say what I think of it , I can only tell you that I don '@@ t believe in the tragedy .
and the reason is this : I think love , both kinds of love , which you remember Plato defines in his " Sym@@ posium " - both kinds of love serve as a touch@@ stone for men .
some men understand only the one , some only the other .
those who understand only the non @@@ -@@ @ plat@@ onic love need not speak of tragedy .
for such love there can be no tragedy .
" thank you kindly for the pleasure , good @@@ -@@ @ bye , " and that 's the whole tragedy .
and for the plat@@ onic love there can be no tragedy either , because there everything is clear and pure , because ... '
here Levin recoll@@ ecting his own sins and the inner struggle he had lived through added unexpectedly ,
it may very well be .
'@@ Well , you see you are very consistent , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
you have a consistent character yourself and you wish all the facts of life to be consistent , but they never are .
for instance you desp@@ ise public service because you want work always to correspond to its aims , and that never happens .
you also want the activity of each separate man to have an aim , and love and family life always to coincide - and that do@@ es@@ n '@@ t happen either .
all the variety , charm and beauty of life are made up of light and shade . '
he was thinking of his own affairs and not listening to O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky had more than once experienced this kind of acute e@@ strang@@ ement instead of union following a dinner with a friend , and knew what to do in such a case .
'@@ the bill ! ' he shouted and went out into the dining @@@ -@@ @ hall , where he immediately saw an aide @@@ -@@ @ de @@@ -@@ @ camp of his acquaintance , and entered into conversation with him about an actress and her protector .
and immediately in conversation with the aide @@@ -@@ @ de @@@ -@@ @ camp O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky felt relief and rest after the talk with Levin , who always demanded of him too great a mental and spiritual strain .
Princess Kit@@ ty SH@@ CH@@ ER@@ B@@ AT@@ SK@@ A@@ Y@@ A W@@ AS eighteen , and this was her first season .
her success in Society was greater than that of her two elder sisters , and greater even than her mother had expected .
Levin 's arrival at the beginning of the winter , his frequent visits and evident love for Kit@@ ty gave rise to her parents ' first serious deliber@@ ation as to her future and to disputes between them .
the Prince took Levin 's part and said he desired nothing better for Kit@@ ty .
when he suddenly left , the Princess was pleased and triumph@@ antly said to her husband , ' You see , I was right ! '
when V@@ ron@@ sky appeared she was still more pleased and was strengthened in her opinion that Kit@@ ty ought to make not only a good but a brilliant match .
in the mother 's eyes there was no comparison between Levin and V@@ ron@@ sky .
nothing better could be desired .
V@@ ron@@ sky was openly attentive to Kit@@ ty when they met at balls , danced with her , and came to the house , so there could be no doubt as to the seriousness of his intentions .
but in spite of this the mother was in a dreadful state of anxiety and agitation all that winter .
everything was done very easily and simply .
at least so it seemed to the Princess . but in her daughters ' case she experienced how far from easy and simple the apparently easy business of mar@@ rying off a daughter really was .
now that her youngest daughter had come out she was living through the same fears and doubts , and having even worse disputes with her husband than on her elder daughters ' account .
the Princess had grown used to this in respect to her older daughters , but now she felt that her husband 's punc@@ tili@@ ousness had more justification .
she could see that lately social customs had changed very much and a mother 's duties had become still more difficult .
'@@ Now@@ adays they don '@@ t give us away in marriage as they used to ! ' said these young girls , and even the old people said the same .
but how marriages are now arranged the Princess could not find out from anyone .
the French way , of parents deciding a daughter 's fate , was not accepted , and was even condemned .
the English way , of giving a girl perfect freedom , was also rejected , and would have been impossible in Russian Society .
everyone with whom the Princess discussed the subject said the same thing : ' well , you know , in our days it is time to give up obsolete customs .
after all it 's the young people who marry and not their parents , therefore they must be left to arrange matters as they think best . '
that is why the Princess was more anxious about Kit@@ ty than she had been about her elder daughters .
and now she was afraid that V@@ ron@@ sky might content himself with merely flir@@ ting with her daughter .
she saw that Kit@@ ty was in love with him , but consol@@ ed herself with the thought that V@@ ron@@ sky was an honest man and therefore would not act in such a way .
at the same time she knew that the freedom now permitted made it easy for a man to turn a girl 's head , and knew how lightly men regarded an offence of that kind .
this conversation had partly reassured the Princess ; but she could not feel quite at ease .
V@@ ron@@ sky had told Kit@@ ty that he and his brother were so used to comply with their mother 's wishes that they never made up their minds to take an important step without consulting her .
'@@ And I am now especially happy looking forward to my mother 's arrival from Petersburg , ' he had said .
Kit@@ ty had narr@@ ated this without att@@ aching any special meaning to the words .
Levin 's arrival that day gave her further cause for anxiety .
'@@ Has he been back long ? ' asked the Princess when they got home , referring to Levin .
'@@ There is one thing I want to say ... ' the Princess began , and from her serious look Kit@@ ty guessed what was coming .
'@@ M@@ ama , ' she said fl@@ ushing and turning quickly toward her mother , ' please , please , say nothing about it !
her wish was the same as her mother 's , but the motive underlying her mother 's wish offended her .
'@@ i won '@@ t , - only this , my dar@@ ling , ' said the mother , seeing tears in her daughter 's eyes , ' ... you promised not to have any secrets from me and you won '@@ t , will you ? '
'@@ Never , M@@ ama , never at all , ' answered Kit@@ ty bl@@ ushing as she looked her mother straight in the face . ' but I have nothing to say at present ... I ... I ... if I wished to , I should not know what to say or how ... I don '@@ t know ... '
'@@ no , she could not possibly tell an un@@ truth with such eyes , ' thought the mother smiling at her agitation and joy .
the Princess smiled to think how immense and important what was going on in her own soul must appear to the poor girl .
during THE interval between dinner and the beginning of the evening party , Kit@@ ty experienced something resembling a young man 's feelings before a battle .
her heart was beating violently and she could not fix her thoughts on anything .
when she thought of the past , she d@@ wel@@ t with pleasure and ten@@ derness on her former relations with Levin .
memories of childhood and of Levin 's friendship with her dead brother lent a peculiar poetic charm to her relations with him .
his love for her , of which she felt sure , fl@@ attered and rejo@@ iced her , and she could think of him with a light heart .
on the other hand when she pic@@ tured to herself a future with V@@ ron@@ sky a brilliant vision of happiness rose up before her , while a future with Levin appeared wrapped in mist .
at half @@@ -@@ @ past seven , as soon as she had come down into the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room , the foot@@ man announced ' Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich Levin ! '
the Princess was still in her bedroom , nor had the Prince yet come down .
'@@ So it 's to be ! ' thought Kit@@ ty and the blood rushed to her heart .
gl@@ ancing at the mirror she was horri@@ fied at her p@@ all@@ or .
she felt sure that he had come so early on purpose to see her alone and to propose to her .
and now for the first time the matter presented itself to her in a different and entirely new light .
because the dear fellow was in love with her .
but it could not be helped , it was necessary and had to be done .
'@@ Oh God , must I tell him so myself ? ' she thought . ' must I really tell him that I don '@@ t care for him ?
I 'll go away .
she was already approaching the door when she heard his step .
what have I to fear ?
I have done nothing wrong .
I 'll tell the truth , come what may !
besides , it 's impossible to feel awkward with him .
here he is ! ' she thought , as she saw his powerful diff@@ id@@ ent figure before her and his shining eyes gaz@@ ing at her .
she looked straight into his face as if entre@@ ating him to spare her , and gave him her hand .
when he saw that his expectation was fulfilled and that nothing prevented his speaking to her , his face clou@@ ded over .
'@@ But all I wanted was to find you alone , ' he began , still standing and avoiding her face so as not to lose courage .
she was so tired yesterday ... '
she spoke without knowing what she was saying , her eyes fixed on him with a ca@@ ressing look full of ent@@ reat@@ y .
her head dropped lower and lower , knowing the answer she would give to what was coming .
'@@ That it would depend on you , ' he repeated . ' I want to say ...
I want to say ... I came on purpose ... that ... to be my wife ! ' he uttered hardly knowing what he said ; but feeling that the worst was out he stopped and looked at her .
she was breathing heavily and not looking at him .
she was filled with rap@@ ture .
her soul was over@@ flowing with happiness .
she had not at all expected that his declaration of love would make so strong an impression on her .
but that lasted only for an instant .
she remembered V@@ ron@@ sky , lifted her clear , truthful eyes to Levin 's face , and noticing his despair she replied quickly :
'@@ It C@@ AN@@ NOT be ... forgive me . '
and how e@@ strang@@ ed and distant she seemed now !
'@@ No@@ thing else was possible , ' he said , without looking at her , and b@@ owing he turned to go ...
but J@@ UST AT THAT moment the Princess came in .
an expression of terror appeared in her face on seeing them alone together and noticing their troubled looks .
Levin bowed to her and said nothing .
'@@ Than@@ k Heaven she has refused him , ' thought the mother , and her face bri@@ ghtened into the usual smile with which she greeted her visitors on Thursday evenings .
she sat down and began questioning Levin about his life in the country .
he too sat down until the arrival of other guests should enable him to get away unnoticed .
she was a thin , sal@@ low , nervous , ailing woman with shining black eyes .
she always dis@@ liked Levin , whom at the beginning of the winter she had often met at the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys .
her constant and favourite amusement was to make fun of him .
'@@ i love it when he looks down at me from the height of his dignity , or breaks off his clever conversation because I am too stupid , or when he shows his con@@ des@@ cension toward me .
I am very glad he h@@ ates me , ' she used to say with reference to him .
the Countess at once attacked Levin .
'@@ Why , of course , I always write them down .
well , Kit@@ ty , have you been skating again ? '
she began to talk with Kit@@ ty .
he was about to rise , when the Princess noticing his silence turned toward him and said :
'@@ Have you come to Moscow for long ?
but I believe you are on the Zem@@ st@@ vo and C@@ AN@@ NOT stay away long ? '
'@@ no , Princess , I am no longer on the Zem@@ st@@ vo , ' he answered , ' I have come to Moscow for a few days . '
'@@ Some@@ thing out of the common has happened to him , ' thought the Countess Nord@@ ston , scrutin@@ izing his stern and serious face ; ' why does he not start on one of his dis@@ courses ?
but I 'll draw him out , I do love to make a fool of him when Kit@@ ty 's about , and I will . '
what is the explanation ?
at that moment another lady entered the room and Levin rose .
'@@ Exc@@ use me , Countess , but really I know nothing about it , and can '@@ t tell you anything , ' he said , and as he turned he saw an officer who had come into the room behind the lady .
'@@ That must be V@@ ron@@ sky , ' he thought , and looked at Kit@@ ty to make sure .
she had already glanced at V@@ ron@@ sky and then turned toward Levin .
and by the look of her eyes which had involun@@ tarily bri@@ ghtened Levin realized that she loved this man , realized it as surely as if she had told it him in so many words .
but what kind of man was he ?
now , rightly or wrong@@ ly , Levin could not but remain . he had to find out what sort of a man it was that she loved .
it struck him immediately .
V@@ ron@@ sky was a dark stur@@ d@@ ily @@@ -@@ @ built man of medium height , with a good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured , handsome , exceedingly quiet and firm face .
everything about his face and figure - from his black closely @@@ -@@ @ cro@@ pped hair and freshly @@@ -@@ @ sha@@ ven chin to his wide , brand @@@ -@@ @ new uniform - was simple and at the same time elegant .
having stepped aside to let a lady pass , V@@ ron@@ sky approached first the Princess and then Kit@@ ty .
having greeted and spoken a few words to every one else , he sat down without having once looked at Levin , who had not taken his eyes off him .
'@@ Let me introduce you , ' said the Princess indicating Levin . ' Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich Levin , Count Alex@@ is Kir@@ il@@ ovich V@@ ron@@ sky . '
V@@ ron@@ sky rose and looking cor@@ di@@ ally into Levin 's eyes pressed his hand .
'@@ i was to have d@@ ined with you earlier this winter , ' he said with his simple frank smile , ' but you unexpectedly went away to the country . '
'@@ My words , must make a deep impression on you for you to remember them so long , ' said Levin ; then recoll@@ ecting that he had said this before he bl@@ ushed .
V@@ ron@@ sky glanced at him and at the Countess , and smiled .
'@@ And do you always live in the country ? ' he asked . ' is@@ n '@@ t it dull in the winter ? '
'@@ no , not when one is busy : nor need one be dull in one 's own company , ' replied Levin abruptly .
'@@ i am fond of the country , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , noticing , but pretending not to notice , Levin 's tone .
'@@ But I hope , Count , you would not consent always to live in the country , ' said the Countess Nord@@ ston .
I have experienced a curious feeling , ' he went on . ' nowhere have I felt so hom@@ es@@ ick for the country , our Russian country , with its peasants in bark @@@ -@@ @ shoes , as when I spent a winter with my mother in Nice .
and Naples and Sor@@ ren@@ to are pleasant only for a short stay , and it is there that one thinks of Russia , and l@@ ongs especially for the Russian countryside .
he was addressing both Kit@@ ty and Levin , his quiet and friendly glance passing from the one to the other . he was evidently speaking quite sincerely and frankly .
noticing that the Countess Nord@@ ston wished to say something , he stopped without finishing what he was saying , and listened attentively to her .
Levin wished to join in the general conversation , but found it impossible , and kept saying to himself , ' Now I will go , ' yet he did not go , but waited for something indefinite .
the conversation touched on table @@@ -@@ @ turning and spirit@@ u@@ alism , and the Countess Nord@@ ston , who believed in spirit@@ u@@ alism , began relating miracles she had witnessed .
I have never seen anything supernatural though I always look out for it , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky smiling .
'@@ Very well , next Saturday , ' replied the Countess Nord@@ ston . ' and you ; Mr. Levin , do you believe in it ? ' she asked , turning to him .
'@@ Why do you ask me ?
you know very well what I shall say . '
'@@ But I want to hear your opinion . '
'@@ My opinion is that this table @@@ -@@ @ turning proves that our so @@@ -@@ @ called educated class is on the same level as the peasants .
they believe in the evil eye and spells and wit@@ ch@@ craft , while we ... '
'@@ Well then , you don '@@ t believe ? '
'@@ i can '@@ t believe , Countess ! '
'@@ Then you think I am not telling the truth ? ' and she laughed mir@@ th@@ lessly .
'@@ You don '@@ t admit that it is even possible ? ' he asked . ' but why not ?
we admit the existence of electricity , which we don '@@ t understand , why can '@@ t there be other forces which we do not yet know , but which ... '
but the Spirit@@ u@@ alists on the contrary began by the tables writing for them and the spirits coming to them , and they only afterwards began to say that it was an unknown force . '
V@@ ron@@ sky listened attentively to Levin as he always listened , evidently interested in what he was saying .
'@@ Yes , but the Spirit@@ u@@ alists say , " We do not yet know what force it is , but it exists and these are the conditions under which it acts .
let the scientists discover what the force is . "
no , I do not see why it should not be a new force , if it ... '
probably feeling that the conversation was becoming too serious for a drawing @@@ -@@ @ room , V@@ ron@@ sky did not reply , but in order to change the subject he smiled g@@ aily and turned toward the ladies .
'@@ Let us try now , Countess , ' he began , but Levin wanted to finish saying what he thought .
'@@ i think , ' he continued , ' that this attempt of the Spirit@@ u@@ alists to explain their wonders by some kind of new force is most unsuccessful .
everybody waited for him to finish and he was conscious of it .
'@@ i think you would make a splendid medium , ' said the Countess Nord@@ ston ; ' there is something ec@@ static about you . '
Levin opened his mouth to reply , but bl@@ ushed and said nothing .
'@@ Let us try table @@@ -@@ @ turning now , Princess Kit@@ ty , please do , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky . ' may we , Princess ? ' he said to her mother and he rose and looked round for a suitable table .
Kit@@ ty rose to fetch a table , and as she passed Levin their eyes met .
she p@@ iti@@ ed him with her whole soul , especially because she herself had caused him to suffer .
'@@ If you can forgive me , please do , ' ple@@ aded her look . ' I am so happy . '
'@@ i hate everybody , including you and myself , ' answered his eyes ; and he took up his hat .
but he was not f@@ ated to go yet .
just as the others began settling round the table and Levin was about to go , the old Prince came in , and having greeted the ladies he turned to Levin .
Kit@@ ty was conscious that , after what had taken place , her father 's cor@@ di@@ ality oppressed Levin .
'@@ Prince , release Mr. Levin for us as we want to try an experiment , ' said the Countess Nord@@ ston .
'@@ What experiment ? table @@@ -@@ @ turning ?
V@@ ron@@ sky 's un@@ fl@@ in@@ ching eye glanced in aston@@ ishment at the old Prince , and slightly smiling he at once began talking to the Countess Nord@@ ston about the ball that was to take place the next week .
'@@ i hope you will be there , ' he said to Kit@@ ty .
as soon as the old Prince had turned away from him Levin went out uno@@ b@@ served , and his last impression was Kit@@ ty 's happy smiling face as she answered V@@ ron@@ sky 's question about the ball .
after THE guests H@@ AD G@@ ONE Kit@@ ty told her mother of her conversation with Levin , and in spite of all her pity for him she was pleased by the thought that she had had a proposal .
she did not doubt that she had acted rightly , yet for a long time she lay in bed unable to sleep .
whether she rep@@ ented of having drawn Levin on or of having rejected him she did not know , but her happiness was troubled by doubts .
I 'll tell you what ! ' shouted the Prince flourishing his arms and immediately again wrap@@ ping his squir@@ rel @@@ -@@ @ lined dressing @@@ -@@ @ g@@ own around him . ' you have no pride , no dignity , you dis@@ grace and ruin your daughter by this v@@ ile idi@@ otic match @@@ -@@ @ making . '
'@@ For goodness ' sake , Prince , what in heaven 's own name have I done ? ' said the Princess almost in tears .
and when she said that , the Prince suddenly fla@@ red up and began to shout rud@@ ely :
'@@ What have you done ?
why this : first of all you enti@@ ce a su@@ itor . all Moscow will talk about it and with reason .
if you give a party invite everybody and not only selected su@@ itors .
invite all the young puppies , ' so the Prince called the Moscow young men , ' have a pian@@ ist and let them dance ; but don '@@ t have the sort of thing we had to @@@ -@@ @ night - these su@@ itors and this pairing off .
Levin is a thousand times the better man .
this one is a little Petersburg f@@ op . they are machine @@@ -@@ @ made by the dozen , all to one pattern , and all mere rub@@ bish .
but even if he were a Prince of the blood my daughter does not need him . '
'@@ Just this ... ' exclaimed the Prince an@@ gr@@ ily .
'@@ i know this much , ' the Princess interrupted him , ' that if I were to listen to what you say we should never see our daughter married , and we had better go and live in the country . '
'@@ So we had ! '
do I draw them on ?
no , certainly not , but a young man and an excellent young man falls in love with Kit@@ ty , and she too seems ... '
'@@ But why do you suppose such a thing ? '
I can recognize a man who has serious intentions - such as Levin - and I can see through a we@@ ather@@ cock like that pop@@ inj@@ ay who only wishes to am@@ use himself . '
'@@ all right . all right , don '@@ t let 's talk , ' said the Princess , interrup@@ ting him and remembering the unfortunate Dol@@ ly .
'@@ Very well then , good @@@ -@@ @ night . '
and having made the sign of the cross over one another and kis@@ sed , feeling that each of them retained their individual opinions , the couple separated for the night .
V@@ ron@@ sky H@@ AD NE@@ V@@ ER K@@ NO@@ W@@ N F@@ AM@@ IL@@ Y LIF@@ E .
his mother in her youth had been a brilliant Society woman , and during her married life and especially in her wi@@ do@@ wh@@ ood had had many love affairs , known to everybody .
he hardly remembered his father , and had been educated in the Cad@@ et Corps .
on leaving that Corps as a very young and brilliant officer he at once joined the swim of the wealthy military Petersburg set .
though he occasionally went into the highest Petersburg Society , all his love interests lay outside it .
in Moscow , after this luxurious course of Petersburg life , he experienced for the first time the delight of intim@@ acy with a sweet , innocent Society girl who fell in love with him .
it never entered his head that there could be any wrong in his relations with Kit@@ ty .
at balls he danced chiefly with her and he visited her at her home .
he talked with her the usual Society talk : all sorts of rub@@ bish , but rub@@ bish into which involun@@ tarily he put a special meaning for her .
he thought he was the first to discover this pleasure and he enjoyed his discovery .
he would not have believed that what gave so much and such excellent pleasure to him , and - what was more - to her , could be wrong .
every less could he have believed that he ought to marry .
marriage had never presented itself to him as a possibility .
and how swe@@ etly , simply , and above all trust@@ fully !
I feel myself better and pu@@ rer , I feel I have a heart and that there is much that is good in me .
those dear loving eyes ! when she said , " and very much . "
it 's pleasant for me and for her , ' and he considered where he should finish his evening .
he passed in review the places he might go to .
'@@ the Club : a game of be@@ zi@@ que , a bottle of champagne with Ig@@ nat@@ ev ?
that 's just what I like about the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys ' , that I myself become better there .
he went straight to his rooms at the Hotel Dus@@ se@@ au , had sup@@ per , and after und@@ ressing had hardly laid his head on his pillow before he was fast asleep .
'@@ H@@ all@@ o , your Excell@@ ency ! ' exclaimed O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . ' whom are you after ? '
'@@ i waited for you till two last night ; where did you go from the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys ' ? '
'@@ - " Fi@@ ery ste@@ eds by " something " brands / I can always recognize ; / youths in love ... " - ' decla@@ im@@ ed O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , just as he had done to Levin .
'@@ Oh ! Mrs. K@@ aren@@ ina ! ' said V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ i expect you know her ? '
'@@ i think I do .
I really can '@@ t remember , ' answered V@@ ron@@ sky absent @@@ -@@ @ min@@ dedly , the name K@@ aren@@ ina suggesting to him some one stiff and dull .
'@@ But you are sure to know Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich K@@ aren@@ in , my famous brother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law .
'@@ Yes , I know him by rep@@ ute and by sight .
I know he is clever , learned , and by way of being religious , but you know it is not my ... not in my line , ' he added in English .
'@@ Oh yes , he is a very remarkable man , a bit conservative , but a splendid fellow , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , ' a splendid fellow . '
'@@ Well , so much the better for him , ' and V@@ ron@@ sky smiled . ' Ah , you are here ! ' he went on , turning toward his mother 's old foot@@ man who was standing by the door . ' come in here . '
besides liking O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , as everybody did , V@@ ron@@ sky lat@@ terly had felt still more drawn to him because he was connected in his mind with Kit@@ ty .
'@@ Well , are we to give a sup@@ per to the di@@ va next Sunday ? ' he asked smil@@ ingly , taking O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's arm .
I say , did you make the acquaintance of my friend Levin last night ? ' asked O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ He is a splendid fellow , ' continued O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . ' Don '@@ t you think so ? '
'@@ i don '@@ t know how it is that all Muscov@@ ites , present company of course excep@@ ted , ' V@@ ron@@ sky put in jo@@ kingly , ' are so abrupt .
they are always standing on their h@@ ind legs getting angry , and seem to want to act on your feelings ... '
'@@ Yes , there is some truth in that , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , laughing mer@@ r@@ ily .
'@@ Sh@@ all we have to wait much longer ? ' asked V@@ ron@@ sky , turning to a porter .
'@@ the train is sign@@ alled , ' said the porter .
the approach of the train was made more and more evident by the increasing bust@@ le and preparation on the platform and the arrival of people who had come to meet the train .
through the fro@@ sty mist one could see work@@ men in she@@ ep@@ skin coats and felt boots crossing the cur@@ ved railway lines , and hear the whistle of a locomotive and the noisy movements of a heavy mass .
'@@ no , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky who was anxious to tell V@@ ron@@ sky about Levin 's intentions concerning Kit@@ ty , ' no , you have not judged my Levin rightly .
V@@ ron@@ sky stopped and asked him straight out :
'@@ What do you mean ?
did he propose to your bel@@ le so@@ eur last night '
'@@ Per@@ haps , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . ' I seemed to notice something of the kind yesterday .
Oh yes , if he left early and was in a bad tem@@ per it must be that ...
V@@ ron@@ sky , as he stood by O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky and watched these passengers coming out of the carriages , quite forgot about his mother .
his chest involun@@ tarily expanded and his eyes shone , he felt himself to be a conqu@@ er@@ or .
'@@ the Countess V@@ ron@@ skaya is in that compartment , ' said the sp@@ rightly guard , addressing V@@ ron@@ sky .
his words r@@ oused V@@ ron@@ sky from his re@@ veri@@ e and reminded him of his mother and of the coming meeting .
V@@ ron@@ sky FO@@ L@@ LO@@ W@@ ED THE guard to the carriage arid had to stop at the entrance of the compartment to let a lady pass out .
the trained insight of a Society man enabled V@@ ron@@ sky with a single glance to decide that she belonged to the best Society .
when he looked round she too turned her head .
in that short look V@@ ron@@ sky had time to notice the subdued animation that en@@ li@@ ven@@ ed her face and seemed to fl@@ utter between her bright eyes and a scarcely percep@@ tible smile which cur@@ ved her rosy lips .
it was as if an excess of vitality so filled her whole being that it betrayed itself against her will , now in her smile , now in the light of her eyes .
she deliberately tried to extingu@@ ish that light in her eyes , but it shone despite of her in her faint smile .
V@@ ron@@ sky entered the carriage .
his mother , a thin old woman with black eyes and cur@@ led hair , scre@@ wed up her eyes as she recognized her son and her thin lips smiled slightly .
'@@ You had my tel@@ eg@@ ram ?
'@@ Have you had a good journey ? ' asked her son , sitting down on the seat beside her and involun@@ tarily listening to a woman 's voice outside the door .
he knew it was the voice of the lady he had met as he entered the carriage .
'@@ all the same I don '@@ t agree with you , ' the lady was saying .
'@@ Y@@ ours are Petersburg views , mad@@ am . '
'@@ Not at all , simply a woman 's views . '
'@@ Well , have you found your brother ? ' asked V@@ ron@@ sky 's mother , addressing the lady .
V@@ ron@@ sky understood now that this was Mrs. K@@ aren@@ ina .
'@@ Your brother is here , ' he said rising . ' excuse my not recognizing you before . our acquaintance was so slight , ' he said with a bow , ' that I am sure you do not remember me . '
V@@ ron@@ sky went out on to the platform and shouted , ' O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky !
here ! '
V@@ ron@@ sky did not take his eyes off her , and kept smiling , he knew not why .
but remembering that his mother was waiting for him he went back into the carriage .
'@@ She is very charming , is@@ n '@@ t she ? ' said the Countess , referring to Mrs. K@@ aren@@ ina . ' her husband put her into the compartment with me and I was very pleased .
we talked all the way .
'@@ i don '@@ t know what you mean , mam@@ an , ' the son replied col@@ dly . ' well , shall we go ? '
Mrs. K@@ aren@@ ina again entered the carriage to take leave of the Countess .
'@@ There , Countess , you have met your son and I my brother , ' she said , ' and I have exhausted my stock of stories and should have had nothing more to tell you . '
'@@ no , no , ' said the Countess holding her hand , ' I could travel round the world with you and not be dull .
you are one of those charming women with whom it is nice to talk , and nice to be silent . but please don '@@ t fre@@ t about your son , you can '@@ t expect never to be parted . '
Mrs. K@@ aren@@ ina stood very erect and her eyes were smiling .
'@@ Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna K@@ aren@@ ina has a son who , I think , is eight years old , ' explained the Countess , ' and she has never before been separated from him and so she is worried at having left him . '
'@@ Yes , the Countess and I have talked all the time - I about my son and she about hers , ' said Mrs. K@@ aren@@ ina , and a smile bri@@ ghtened her face , a kind smile on his account .
'@@ i expect you got very weary of it , ' he said , quickly seizing in its flight the ball of co@@ que@@ try she had thrown at him .
but she evidently did not wish to continue the conversation in that tone , and turned to the old Countess .
'@@ Than@@ k you very much .
I hardly noticed how the time passed .
'@@ Good @@@ -@@ @ bye , dear ! ' answered the Countess .
'@@ Let me kiss your pretty face .
conventional as the phrase was , Mrs. K@@ aren@@ ina evidently believed it and was pleased .
she bl@@ ushed , sto@@ op@@ ed a little , and held out her face for the Countess to kiss , then she stood up again , and with the same smile ho@@ vering between her lips and eyes held out her hand to V@@ ron@@ sky .
he pressed the little hand , and the firm grip with which she shook his gave him unusual pleasure .
she went out with that b@@ risk t@@ read which carried her rather full figure with such wonderful ease .
'@@ Very charming , ' said the old lady .
he followed her with his eyes as long as he could see her graceful form , and his face retained its smile .
'@@ Well , mam@@ an , are you quite well ? ' he said , turning toward his mother .
Alexander was very nice , and Var@@ ya looks very handsome .
and she began to tell about what interested her most , her grandson 's ch@@ rist@@ ening , for which she had gone to Petersburg , and the special favour the Emperor had shown to her el@@ dest son .
'@@ Here is Lav@@ ren@@ ty at last , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky looking out of the window . ' we can go now if you like . '
the old major @@@ -@@ @ dom@@ o , who had accompanied the Countess on her journey , came in and announced that everything was ready , and the Countess rose to go .
'@@ Come , there is not much of a crowd now , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky .
V@@ ron@@ sky gave his arm to his mother , but , just as they were coming out of the carriage , several people ran past them with frightened faces .
the station @@@ -@@ @ master with his peculiar coloured cap also ran past them .
evidently something unusual had happened .
where ? ...
thrown himself under ... Run over ... ' shouted the pass@@ ers @@@ -@@ @ by .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , with his sister on his arm , also turned back , and , avoiding the crowd , stood with frightened faces beside the carriage .
the ladies re @@@ -@@ @ entered the carriage , while V@@ ron@@ sky and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky followed the crowd , to find out about the accident .
a watch@@ man , either ti@@ p@@ sy or too much mu@@ ff@@ led up because of the severe frost , had not heard a tram that was being shun@@ ted , and had been run over .
before V@@ ron@@ sky and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky returned the ladies had heard this from the major @@@ -@@ @ dom@@ o .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky and V@@ ron@@ sky had both seen the man@@ g@@ led corpse .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky was evidently suffering .
his face was p@@ uck@@ ered and he seemed ready to cry .
'@@ ah , how terrible !
Oh , Anna , if you had seen it !
Ah , how terrible ! ' he kept saying .
V@@ ron@@ sky remained silent . his handsome face was serious but perfectly calm .
'@@ Oh , if you had seen it , Countess , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . and his wife was there ...
she threw herself on the body .
'@@ Can nothing be done for her ? ' said Mrs. K@@ aren@@ ina in an ag@@ itated whis@@ per .
V@@ ron@@ sky glanced at her and at once went out .
'@@ i will be back directly , mam@@ an , ' he added , turning at the doorway .
when he returned a few minutes later O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky was already talking to the Countess about the new opera singer , while she was impati@@ ently gl@@ ancing at the door in expectation of her son .
'@@ Now let 's go , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky as he came in .
they went together , V@@ ron@@ sky walking in front with his mother , Mrs. K@@ aren@@ ina following with her brother .
at the exit the station@@ master over@@ took them , and said to V@@ ron@@ sky :
'@@ For the widow , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , sh@@ ru@@ gging his shoulders . ' I don '@@ t understand what need there is to ask . '
'@@ You have given it ! ' exclaimed O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky behind V@@ ron@@ sky , and pressing his sister 's arm he added , ' Very kind , very kind !
is@@ n '@@ t he a fine fellow ?
my respects to you , Countess , ' and he remained behind with his sister , seeking her maid .
when they came out , the V@@ ron@@ sk@@ ys ' carriage had already started .
the people coming from the station were still talking about the accident .
'@@ What a terrible death ! ' said some gentleman as he passed them ; ' cut in half , I hear . '
'@@ on the contrary , I think it is a very easy death , instantane@@ ous , ' said another .
'@@ How is it that precautions are not taken ? ' said a third .
Mrs. K@@ aren@@ ina got into her brother 's carriage , and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky noticed with surprise that her lips were trembling and that it was with difficulty she kept back her tears .
'@@ What is the matter with you , Anna ? ' he asked when they had gone a few hundred yards .
'@@ What nonsense ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . ' you 're here , and that is the chief thing .
you can '@@ t think how my hopes rest on you . '
'@@ And have you known V@@ ron@@ sky long ? ' she asked .
do you know we hope he will marry Kit@@ ty ? '
'@@ Yes , all my hopes are fixed on you , ' said her brother .
and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky began his story .
on reaching his house , he helped his sister out of the carriage , pressed her hand , and drove off to his office .
when AN@@ NA arrived Dol@@ ly was sitting in her little drawing @@@ -@@ @ room giving a fair @@@ -@@ @ haired , pl@@ ump little boy ( who already resem@@ bled his father ) a French reading @@@ -@@ @ lesson .
his mother moved his pl@@ ump little hand away several times , but it always returned to the button .
though she had sent word to her husband the day before that she did not care whether his sister came or not , she had prepared everything for her visit and awaited her with agitation .
Dol@@ ly was over@@ powered by her sorrow and was quite absorbed by it .
nevertheless , she remembered that her sister @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , Anna , was the wife of one of the most important men in Petersburg , and a gran@@ de d@@ ame .
it was true that , as far as she could remember her visit to the K@@ aren@@ ins in Petersburg , she had not liked their house : there seemed to be something false in the tone of their family life .
all these last days Dol@@ ly had been alone with her children .
she did not wish to talk about her sorrow , yet with that on her mind she could not talk about indifferent matters .
as it often happens , though she kept looking at the clock , waiting for Anna , she let the moment when her visitor arrived go by without even hearing the bell .
and when she heard soft steps and the ru@@ st@@ le of pet@@ ti@@ coats already in the doorway , she looked round with an expression not of pleasure but of surprise on her care@@ worn face .
'@@ Dol@@ ly , I am so pleased to see you ! '
'@@ And I am pleased too , ' said Dol@@ ly with a fee@@ ble smile trying to guess from Anna 's expression how much she knew .
dear me , how he has grown ! ' said Anna , and having kis@@ sed him , she stood with her eyes fixed on Dol@@ ly and bl@@ ushed . ' no , please do not let us go anywhere . '
she took off her sha@@ w@@ l and her hat and , having caught it in her black and very cur@@ ly hair , shook her head to dis@@ engage it .
'@@ And you are radiant with joy and health ! ' said Dol@@ ly almost en@@ viously .
'@@ Why , dear me , here is T@@ anya !
she not only mentioned them all by name , but remembered the years and even the months of their births , their characters , and what illnesses they had had ; and Dol@@ ly could not help appreci@@ ating this .
'@@ Sh@@ all we go and see them ? ' she said . ' it is a pity Vas@@ ya is asleep . '
Anna took hold of the tray , but then pushed it aside .
she expected now to hear words of ins@@ incere sympathy : but Anna said nothing of the kind .
'@@ Dol@@ ly dear ! ' she began , ' I do not wish to take his part or console you ; that would be impossible , but , de@@ arest , I am simply sorry for you , sorry from the bottom of my heart ! '
her bright eyes under their thick l@@ ashes suddenly filled with tears .
the latter did not draw back from her but her face retained its rigid expression .
'@@ It is impossible to console me .
everything is lost after what has happened , everything destroyed ! '
as soon as she had said it her face sof@@ tened .
'@@ But what is to be done , Dol@@ ly , what is to be done ?
what is the best way of acting in this dreadful position ? that is what one has to consider . '
'@@ Everything is at an end , and that 's all , ' said Dol@@ ly . ' and the worst of it is , you understand , that I can '@@ t leave him : there are the children , and I am bound .
yet I can '@@ t live with him ; it is torture for me to see him . '
'@@ Dol@@ ly , my dar@@ ling , he has spoken to me , but I want to hear it from you . tell me everything . '
Dol@@ ly looked at her inqu@@ ir@@ ingly .
sincere sympathy and affection were visible in Anna 's face .
'@@ If you like , ' said Dol@@ ly suddenly , ' but I 'll begin from the beginning .
with the education M@@ ama gave me , I was not merely naive , but silly ! I knew nothing .
I know they say husbands tell their wives how they have lived , but Steve ... ' She corrected herself .
'@@ But Stephen Ark@@ ady@@ evich never told me anything . you will hardly believe it , but up to now I thought I was the only woman he had ever known .
in this way I lived for nine years .
only think , that I not only did not suspect him of un@@ faith@@ fulness , but thought it impossible . I then ... just imagine , with such ideas suddenly to find out all the horrors , all the ab@@ om@@ ination ...
try to understand me .
to be fully convinced of one 's happiness and suddenly ... ' continued Dol@@ ly , suppressing her so@@ bs , ' to read a letter , his letter to his mistress , my children 's govern@@ ess . no , it is too horrible ! '
'@@ Oh yes , I do , I do understand , Dol@@ ly dear , I do understand , ' said Anna , pressing her hand .
'@@ And do you think he realizes the horror of my situation ? ' continued Dol@@ ly . ' not at all !
'@@ Oh no , ' Anna quickly interrupted . ' he is p@@ iti@@ able , he is overwhelmed with remor@@ se ... '
'@@ is he capable of remor@@ se ? ' interrupted Dol@@ ly , looking search@@ ingly into her sister @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law 's face .
I could not look at him without pity .
we both know him .
'@@ Yes , I understand that his position is dreadful ; it is worse for the guilty than for the innocent one , ' she said , ' if he feels that the mis@@ fortune all comes from his fault .
but how can I forgive him , how can I be a wife to him after her ? ...
life with him now will be a torture for me , just because I love my old love for him ... '
so@@ bs cut short her words .
but as if intentionally every time she sof@@ tened , she again began to speak of the thing that irrit@@ ated her .
'@@ You know she is young , she is pretty , ' she said . ' you see , Anna , my youth and my good looks have been sacrificed , and to whom ?
for him and his children .
I have served his purpose and lost all I had in the service , and of course a fresh , good @@@ -@@ @ for @@@ -@@ @ nothing creature now pleas@@ es him better .
I could kill him ... '
'@@ Dol@@ ly de@@ arest ! I understand , but don '@@ t torture yourself .
you are so deeply hurt , so upset , that you see many things in the wrong light . '
'@@ What am I to do ? think it over , Anna , help me !
Anna could not think of anything , but her heart responded to every word and every look of Dol@@ ly 's .
he can hardly believe now - can hardly understand - how he could do it . '
'@@ no , he understands and understood , ' Dol@@ ly interrupted . ' and I ... you forget me ... Does it make it easier for me ? '
when he was speaking to me , I confess I did not quite realize the misery of your position .
'@@ i know the world better than you do , ' she said . ' I know men like Steve and how they see these things .
you think he spoke to her about you .
that never happens .
these men may be un@@ faithful , but their homes , their wives , are their holy places .
they manage in some way to hold these women in contempt and don '@@ t let them interfere with the family .
they seem to draw some kind of line between the family and those others .
I do not understand it , but it is so . '
'@@ Dol@@ ly , wait a bit .
I have seen Steve when he was in love with you .
you know we used to laugh at him because his every third word was , " Dol@@ ly is a wonderful woman . "
you have been and still are his div@@ inity , and this inf@@ at@@ uation never reached his soul ... '
'@@ But suppose the inf@@ at@@ uation is repeated ? '
'@@ It C@@ AN@@ NOT be , as I understand ... '
'@@ And you , would you forgive ? '
yes , I can , ' said Anna , after a minute 's consideration . her mind had taken in and weighed the situation , and she added , ' Yes , I can , I can .
yes , I should forgive .
I should not remain the same woman - no , but I should forgive , and forgive it as utterly as if it had never happened at all . '
'@@ Well , of course ... ' Dol@@ ly put in quickly as if saying what she had often herself thought , ' or else it would not be forgiveness .
if one is to forgive , it must be entire forgiveness .
she spent the earlier part of the day with Dol@@ ly and the children , and sent a note to her brother to be sure and come home to dinner .
'@@ Come , ' she wrote . ' God is mer@@ ciful . '
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky d@@ ined at home , the conversation was general , and his wife addressed him famili@@ arly in the second person singular , which she had not done all these days .
there was still the same e@@ strang@@ ement in their manner to each other , but no longer any question of separating , and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky saw that explanation and reconciliation were possible .
she knew Anna , but only slightly , and came to her sister 's not without fear of how she might be received by this Petersburg Society woman whom everybody admired so much .
but she noticed at once that Anna liked her .
Kit@@ ty felt that Anna was perfectly unaffected and was not trying to conceal anything , but that she lived in another , higher world full of complex poetic interests beyond Kit@@ ty 's reach .
after dinner , when Dol@@ ly had gone to her own room , Anna got up quickly and went to her brother who was just lighting a ci@@ gar .
he understood , threw down his ci@@ gar , and disappeared through the door .
when O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky had gone , she returned to the sofa where she had been sitting surrounded by the children .
'@@ Now how were we sitting before ? ' said Anna , resum@@ ing her seat .
and G@@ ris@@ ha again pushed his head under her arm and leaning against her dress be@@ amed with pride and joy .
'@@ And when is the ball to be ? ' said Anna , turning to Kit@@ ty .
'@@ Next week , and it will be a delightful ball .
one of those balls which are always j@@ ol@@ ly . '
'@@ are there any that are always j@@ ol@@ ly ? ' asked Anna with tender irony .
'@@ It is strange , but there are !
'@@ How can you be dull at a ball ? '
'@@ Why C@@ AN@@ NOT I be dull at a ball ? ' asked Anna .
'@@ Because you must always be the bel@@ le of the ball . '
Anna had a capacity for bl@@ ushing .
'@@ in the first place , I never am : but even if I were , what use would it be to me ? '
'@@ i suppose I shall have to .
here , take this , ' she said , turning to T@@ anya who was drawing off a ring which fitted loosely on her aunt 's small tap@@ ering finger .
'@@ i shall be very glad if you go . I should so like to see you at a ball . '
'@@ Well , then , if I have to go , I shall console myself with the reflection that it will give you pleasure ...
G@@ ris@@ ha , please don '@@ t pull so hard , it is all in a t@@ angle already , ' she said , arranging a loose lock of hair with which G@@ ris@@ ha was playing .
'@@ i imagine you at that ball in l@@ il@@ ac ! '
'@@ Why must it be l@@ il@@ ac ? ' asked Anna half laughing . ' now , children , run away , run away .
there 's Miss H@@ ull calling you to tea , ' she went on , dis@@ engaging herself from the children and dispat@@ ching them to the dining @@@ -@@ @ room .
'@@ But I know why you are asking me to go to that ball .
you 're expecting much from it , and would like everybody to be there and have a share in it . '
'@@ How do you know ?
who has not passed through it ? '
Kit@@ ty smiled and remained silent .
how I should like to know her story ! ' thought she , recoll@@ ecting the un@@ poetic appearance of Anna 's husband Alex@@ is K@@ aren@@ in .
I like him very much , ' Anna continued . ' I met V@@ ron@@ sky at the railway station . '
'@@ Oh , was he there ? ' asked Kit@@ ty , bl@@ ushing . ' what did Steve tell you ? '
'@@ Steve let it all out to me , and I shall be very pleased .
'@@ What did his mother tell you ? '
'@@ Oh very much ! and I know he is her favourite , but anyone can see he is full of chi@@ val@@ ry ...
for instance she told me that he wished to give all his property to his brother , that already as a boy he had done something extraordinary , saved a woman from drow@@ ning .
in a word , he is a hero , ' said Anna , smiling and remembering the 200 roubles he had given away at the station .
for some reason she did not like to think about them .
she felt that there had been something in it relating personally to her that should not have been .
'@@ She particularly wished me to go and see her , ' continued Anna . ' I shall be glad to see the old lady again , and will go to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row .
well , thank heaven Steve is stopping a long time with Dol@@ ly , ' she added changing the subject , and she rose , dissatisfied with something , Kit@@ ty thought .
'@@ i was first ! ' ' no , I ! ' cried the children , who having finished their tea rushed back to A@@ unt Anna .
'@@ all together ! ' said Anna laughing and running to meet them , and putting her arms round them she tum@@ bled the whole heap of children - struggling and shri@@ e@@ king joy@@ fully - on to the floor .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky did not appear .
he had probably left his wife 's room by the other door .
'@@ i 'm afraid you will be cold up@@ stairs , ' remarked Dol@@ ly to Anna . ' I want to move you down , and then we shall be nearer to one another . '
'@@ Oh , please don '@@ t trouble about me , ' said Anna , scrutin@@ izing Dol@@ ly 's face and trying to discover whether a reconciliation had taken place .
'@@ i assure you that I sleep always and anywhere like a d@@ orm@@ ouse . '
'@@ What are you talking about ? ' asked O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , entering the room from his study and addressing his wife .
from his tone both Kit@@ ty and Anna gathered that a reconciliation had taken place .
'@@ i want to move Anna down@@ stairs , only the curtains must be changed .
I shall have to do it myself , no one else can do it , ' Dol@@ ly answered addressing him .
'@@ Goo@@ dness knows if they have quite made it up , ' thought Anna on hearing her tone , which was cold and calm .
'@@ Come now , Dol@@ ly ! always making difficulties , ' said her husband . ' if you like I will do it all . '
'@@ Yes , they must have come together again , ' thought Anna .
'@@ Yes , a full , a full reconciliation , quite complete . thank God ! ' thought Anna , and pleased to have been the means of bringing it about , she went up to Dol@@ ly and kis@@ sed her .
'@@ Not at all . why do you so desp@@ ise Matthew and me ? ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , turning to his wife with a slight smile .
while they were talking about their mutual Petersburg acquaintances Anna rose suddenly .
'@@ i have her photo in my album , ' said she , ' and I 'll show you my Ser@@ ez@@ ha 's too , ' she added with a mother 's proud smile .
she long@@ ed to look at his portrait and to talk about him .
seizing the first opportunity she rose and , stepping firmly and lightly , went out to fetch her album .
the flight of stairs to her room went up from a landing of the well @@@ -@@ @ heated front staircase .
as she was coming out of the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room there was a ring at the door .
'@@ Who can it be ? ' asked Dol@@ ly .
Anna looked down from the landing where she stood and at once recognized V@@ ron@@ sky , and a strange feeling of pleasure mixed with fear suddenly stirred in her heart .
he stood in his over@@ coat , feeling for something in his pockets .
when Anna was half @@@ -@@ @ way up the top flight , he lifted his eyes and saw her , and a look of something like embarrassment and fear came into his face .
she bowed slightly and went on . she heard O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's loud voice down@@ stairs asking him to come in , and V@@ ron@@ sky 's low , soft voice refusing .
'@@ He seemed so que@@ er , ' added O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ He has been to our house , ' she thought , ' and not finding me in he guessed that I was here . and he would not come in because Anna is here , and he thought it too late . '
they all glanced at one another and said nothing but began examining Anna 's album .
there was nothing extraordinary or strange in the fact that a man had called at half @@@ -@@ @ past nine at a friend 's house to ask about a dinner they were planning and that he would not come in ; but it seemed strange to all of them .
to Anna in particular it seemed strange and not right .
the B@@ ALL H@@ AD ON@@ LY J@@ UST BE@@ G@@ UN when Kit@@ ty and her mother asc@@ ended the broad staircase which was delu@@ ged with light , decorated with flow@@ ering plants , and occupied by pow@@ dered foot@@ men in red li@@ ver@@ ies .
she had given the first quad@@ r@@ ille to V@@ ron@@ sky and had to give the second to this youth .
it was one of Kit@@ ty 's happy days .
all three buttons on each of her long gloves , which fitted without changing the shape of her hand , fast@@ ened without coming off .
that ribbon was charming , and when Kit@@ ty had looked at her neck in the glass at home , she felt that that ribbon was eloqu@@ ent .
there might be some possible doubt about anything else , but that ribbon was charming .
Kit@@ ty smiled , here at the ball , when she caught sight of it again in the mirror .
her bare shoulders and arms gave her a sensation as of cold marble , a feeling she liked very much .
her eyes shone and she could not keep her rosy lips from smiling at the consciousness of her attractive appearance .
she looked about for some one to hold her fan and the mistress of the house took it from her with a smile .
'@@ How fine that you have come in good time , ' he said with his arm round her waist . ' it 's wrong of people to come so late . '
bending her left arm she put her hand on his shoulder , and her little feet in their pink shoes began moving quickly , lightly , and rhyth@@ m@@ ically in time with the music , over the smooth par@@ quet floor .
she smiled at his praise , and over his shoulder continued to survey the ball @@@ -@@ @ room .
'@@ Sh@@ all we have another turn ?
you are not tired ? ' asked Kor@@ sun@@ sky who was a little out of breath .
'@@ i believe Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna K@@ aren@@ ina is here , take me to her . '
Kor@@ sun@@ sky bowed , strai@@ ghtened his broad shirt front , and offered Kit@@ ty his arm to conduct her to Anna .
Kit@@ ty fl@@ ushed and , a little gi@@ d@@ dy , took her train off Kri@@ vin 's knees and looked round for Anna .
her dress was rich@@ ly trim@@ med with Venetian lace .
in her black hair , all her own , she wore a little gar@@ land of pan@@ sies , and in her gir@@ dle , among the lace , a bunch of the same flowers .
her co@@ i@@ ff@@ ure was very uno@@ b@@ tru@@ sive .
the only noticeable things about it were the wil@@ ful ring@@ lets that always escaped at her temples and on the n@@ ape of her neck and added to her beauty .
round her fin@@ ely ch@@ is@@ elled neck she wore a string of pear@@ ls .
Kit@@ ty had been seeing Anna every day and was in love with her and had always imagined her in l@@ il@@ ac , but seeing her in black she felt that she had never before realized her full charm .
she now saw her in a new and quite unexpected light .
she now realized that Anna could not have worn l@@ il@@ ac , and that her charm lay precisely in the fact that her personality always stood out from her dress , that her dress was never conspicuous on her .
and her black vel@@ vet with rich lace was not at all conspicuous , but served only as a frame ; she alone was noticeable - simple , natural , elegant and at the same time mer@@ ry and animated .
she was standing among that group , very erect as usual , and was talking to the master of the house with her head slightly turned toward him , when Kit@@ ty approached .
'@@ no , I am not going to throw the first stone , ' she was saying in reply to some question , adding , with a sh@@ rug of her shoulders , ' although I C@@ AN@@ NOT understand it ' ; and at once she turned to Kit@@ ty with a tender protecting smile .
'@@ Oh , you know one another ? ' asked the host .
my wife and I are like white wolves , every one knows us , ' answered Kor@@ sun@@ sky . ' Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna , just one turn ? '
'@@ i don '@@ t dance if it is possible not to , ' she said .
'@@ But to @@@ -@@ @ night it is not possible , ' he re@@ joined .
at that moment V@@ ron@@ sky approached .
'@@ Well , if it is impossible not to dance to @@@ -@@ @ night , let us dance , ' she said taking no notice of V@@ ron@@ sky 's bow and quickly putting her hand on Kor@@ sun@@ sky 's shoulder .
'@@ Why is she dis@@ pleased with him ? ' thought Kit@@ ty , noticing that Anna had intentionally taken no notice of V@@ ron@@ sky 's bow .
he came up to Kit@@ ty , reminding her of the first quad@@ r@@ ille and regre@@ tting that he had not seen her for such a long time .
Kit@@ ty , while gaz@@ ing with admiration at Anna wal@@ t@@ zing , listened to him , expecting him to ask her to wal@@ tz , but he did not do so and she glanced at him with surprise .
he bl@@ ushed and hur@@ ri@@ edly asked her to dance , but scarcely had he put his arm round her slim waist and taken one step when the music stopped .
'@@ Par@@ don , pardon , a wal@@ tz - a wal@@ tz , ' shouted Kor@@ sun@@ sky from the other end of the room , and seizing the first girl within reach he himself began dancing .
V@@ ron@@ sky AND Kit@@ ty wal@@ t@@ zed several times round the room and then Kit@@ ty went to her mother , but hardly had she exchanged a few words with the Countess Nord@@ ston before V@@ ron@@ sky returned to fetch her for the first quad@@ r@@ ille .
it seemed to her that the ma@@ z@@ ur@@ ka would settle everything .
she was sure that she would dance the ma@@ z@@ ur@@ ka with him as at previous balls , and she refused five other partners for that dance , saying that she was already engaged .
the whole ball up to the last quad@@ r@@ ille was for Kit@@ ty an enchan@@ ted dream of gay flowers , sounds and movements .
she only stopped dancing when she felt too tired and had to ask to be allowed a rest .
but while dancing the last quad@@ r@@ ille with one of the youthful bo@@ res whom it would not do to refuse , she happened to be vis @@@ -@@ @ à @@@ -@@ @ vis to Anna .
she had not come across Anna since the beginning of the ball , and now she suddenly saw her again in a different and unexpected light .
she noticed that Anna was el@@ ated with success , a feeling Kit@@ ty herself knew so well .
she saw that Anna was intox@@ icated by the rap@@ ture she had produced .
'@@ no , it is not the admiration of the crowd that intox@@ icates her , but the rap@@ ture of one , and that one is ... can it be he ? '
every time he spoke to Anna the joyful light kind@@ led in her eyes and a smile of pleasure cur@@ ved her rosy lips .
she seemed to make efforts to restrain these signs of joy , but they appeared on her face of their own accord .
Kit@@ ty looked at him and was filled with horror .
what she saw so distinctly in the mirror of Anna 's face , she saw in him .
what had become of his usually quiet and firm manner and the ca@@ relessly calm expression of his face ?
every time he turned toward Anna he slightly bowed his head as if he wished to fall down before her , and in his eyes there was an expression of submission and fear .
'@@ i do not wish to offend , ' his every look seemed to say , ' I only wish to save myself , but I do not know how . '
they talked about their mutual friends , carrying on a most un@@ important conversation , but it seemed to Kit@@ ty that every word they said was deciding their and her fate .
a mist came over the ball and the whole world in Kit@@ ty 's soul .
only the thorough training she had had enabled and obliged her to do what was expected of her , that is , to dance , to answer the questions put to her , to talk , and even to smile .
but before the ma@@ z@@ ur@@ ka began , when the chairs were already being placed for it , and several couples moved from the small to the large ball @@@ -@@ @ room , Kit@@ ty was for a moment seized with despair .
she must tell her mother that she was feeling ill , and go home , but she had not the strength to do it .
but although she seemed like a butterfly just settled on a blade of grass and ready at any moment to fl@@ utter and spread its rain@@ bow wings , her heart was crushed with terrible despair .
'@@ But perhaps I am mistaken , perhaps it was nothing of the kind ? '
and she again recalled all that she had witnessed .
'@@ Kit@@ ty , what does this mean ? ' asked the Countess Nord@@ ston , coming up in@@ audi@@ bly over the carpet . ' I don '@@ t understand it . '
'@@ no , no , ' said Kit@@ ty in a voice trem@@ ulous with tears .
the Countess Nord@@ ston , who was engaged to Kor@@ sun@@ sky for the ma@@ z@@ ur@@ ka , told him to ask Kit@@ ty instead .
Kit@@ ty danced in the first pair , and luckily for her she was not obliged to talk , because Kor@@ sun@@ sky ran about all the time giving orders in his domain .
V@@ ron@@ sky and Anna sat almost opposite to her .
and she saw them with her far @@@ -@@ @ sighted eyes , she saw them close by , too ; when they met in the dance , and the more she saw of them the su@@ rer she was that the blow had fallen .
she saw that they felt as if they were alone in that crowded ball @@@ -@@ @ room .
on V@@ ron@@ sky 's face , usually so firm and self @@@ -@@ @ possessed she noticed that expression of bewil@@ der@@ ment and submission which had so surprised her - an expression like that of an intelligent dog when it feels guilty .
Anna smiled - and the smile passed on to him ; she became thoughtful - and he became serious .
some supernatural power attracted Kit@@ ty 's eyes to Anna 's face .
Kit@@ ty admired her even more than before , and suffered more and more .
she felt herself crushed and her face expressed it .
when V@@ ron@@ sky happened to knock against her as they danced , he did not at once recognize her , so changed was she .
'a delightful ball , ' he remarked , in order to say something .
in the middle of the ma@@ z@@ ur@@ ka , performing a complicated figure newly @@@ -@@ @ invented by Kor@@ sun@@ sky , Anna stepped into the middle of the room and chose two men and two ladies , one of whom was Kit@@ ty , to join her .
'@@ Yes , there is something strange , sat@@ anic , and enchan@@ ting about her , ' thought Kit@@ ty .
'@@ Come , Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna , ' began Kor@@ sun@@ sky , drawing her bare arm under his , ' I have such a good idea for a co@@ til@@ lion - U@@ n bi@@ j@@ ou . '
and he moved slowly on , trying to draw her with him .
their host smiled appro@@ v@@ ingly .
'@@ So you really are going to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row ? ' said V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ Yes , I think so , ' Anna replied as if surprised at the bold@@ ness of his question ; but the un@@ controllable radi@@ ance of her eyes and her smile burnt him as she spoke the words .
Anna did not stay for sup@@ per , but went away .
'@@ Y@@ ES , TH@@ ERE IS CER@@ TA@@ IN@@ LY SO@@ ME@@ TH@@ ING objec@@ tionable and rep@@ ell@@ ent about me , ' thought Levin after leaving the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys , as he walked toward his brother 's lo@@ dg@@ ings . ' I do not get on with other people .
they say it is pride !
no , I am not even proud .
if I had any pride , I should not have put myself into such a position . '
and he pic@@ tured to himself V@@ ron@@ sky , happy , kind , clever , calm , and certainly never placing himself in such a terrible position as he , Levin , had been in that evening .
'@@ Yes , she was bound to choose him .
it had to be so , and I have no cause to complain of anyone or anything .
it was my own fault .
what right had I to imagine that she would wish to unite her life with mine ?
and he remembered his brother Nicholas , and kept his mind gladly on that memory .
of course , from Pro@@ k@@ of@@ y 's point of view , who saw him in a r@@ agged coat and ti@@ p@@ sy , he is a des@@ pic@@ able fellow ; but I know him from another side .
I know his soul , and know that we resemble one another .
and yet I , instead of looking him up , d@@ ined out and came here . '
Levin went up to a lamp @@@ -@@ @ post and read his brother 's address which he had in his pocket @@@ -@@ @ book , and then hired a sle@@ dge .
on the long way to his brother 's he recalled all the events he knew of Nicholas 's life .
he remembered how his brother had brought a boy from the country to educate , and in a fit of anger had so beaten the l@@ ad that proceedings were commenced against him for causing bodily harm .
he remembered an affair with a shar@@ per to whom his brother had lost money , and whom he had first given a promis@@ sory note and then prosecuted on a charge of fraud .
( that was when his brother Sergi@@ us had paid the money for him . )
it was all very disgu@@ sting , but to Levin it did not seem nearly so disgu@@ sting as it must have seemed to those who did not know Nicholas , nor his whole story , nor his heart .
he was te@@ ased and called ' Noah ' and ' monk , ' and then when he broke loose no one helped him , but all turned away from him with horror and dis@@ gust .
Levin felt that his brother Nicholas , in his soul , in the in@@ ner@@ most depths of his soul , despite the de@@ pra@@ vity of his life , was no worse than those who desp@@ ised him .
it was not his fault that he was born with his un@@ govern@@ able tem@@ per , and with a cr@@ amped mind .
he always wished to do right .
'@@ i will tell him everything , I will get him to tell me everything . I will show him that I love and therefore understand him , ' Levin decided in his mind , as toward eleven o 'clock he drove up to the hotel of which he had the address .
'@@ Up@@ stairs , N@@ os@@ . i@@ 2 and i@@ 3 , ' said the hall porter in reply to Levin 's question .
as he entered the doorway the stranger 's voice was saying :
'@@ It all depends on how intellig@@ ently and rationally the affair is conducted . '
he could not see his brother , and his heart sank painfully at the thought that Nicholas lived among such strange people .
no one noticed him , and , as he took off his gol@@ os@@ hes , he over@@ heard what the man in the work@@ man 's coat was saying .
'@@ Oh , let the privileged classes go to the devil , ' said his brother 's voice , with a cough .
'@@ M@@ asha , get us some sup@@ per and bring the wine if any is left , or send for some . '
'@@ Here is a gentleman , Nicholas Dmit@@ rich , ' she said .
'@@ Who@@ m do you want ? ' said Nicholas Levin 's voice an@@ gr@@ ily .
'@@ It is I , ' answered Constan@@ tine Levin , coming forward into the lamp @@@ -@@ @ light .
'@@ Who 's I ? ' said the voice of Nicholas Levin still more an@@ gr@@ ily .
he was even more em@@ aci@@ ated than three years before when Constan@@ tine Levin had last seen him .
he was wearing a short coat , and his hands and broad bones appeared more immense than ever .
his hair was thinner but the same straight mou@@ st@@ ache covered his lips ; and the same eyes with their peculiar , naive gaze looked out at the new @@@ -@@ @ com@@ er .
'@@ ah ! Ko@@ st@@ ya ! ' he said suddenly , recognizing his brother , and his eyes lit up with joy .
'@@ i wrote both to you and to Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich that I do not know you and do not wish to know you .
what is it ? what do you want ? '
he was not at all as Constan@@ tine had imagined him .
'@@ i do not want anything of you specially , ' he answered me@@ ek@@ ly ; ' I have simply come to see you . '
his brother 's tim@@ idity obviously sof@@ tened Nicholas , whose lips qui@@ vered .
'@@ ah ! you have come just for that ? ' he said .
no , wait a little .
do you know who this is ? ' he added , turning to his brother and pointing to the man in the work@@ man 's coat . ' it is Mr. K@@ rit@@ sky , my friend ever since my Kiev days , a very remarkable fellow .
of course the police are after him , because he is not a s@@ coun@@ dre@@ l . '
and he glanced round at everybody present as was his way .
'@@ You were at Kiev University ? ' Constan@@ tine Levin asked K@@ rit@@ sky , in order to break the awkward silence that followed .
'@@ Yes , at Kiev , ' K@@ rit@@ sky replied with an angry fro@@ wn .
so now you know whom you have to deal with , and if you fear you will be degraded - there is the door . '
and again his eyes glanced question@@ ingly around .
'@@ Why should I be degraded ? I don '@@ t understand . '
'@@ Well , M@@ asha , order sup@@ per for three , with vodka and wine ...
no , wait .
'@@ SO YOU SE@@ E ... ' Nicholas Levin CON@@ T@@ IN@@ UE@@ D with an effort , wrink@@ ling his bro@@ w and t@@ wit@@ ching .
he kept gl@@ ancing at his brother 's sick@@ ly , consu@@ mp@@ tive face , and felt more and more sorry for him , nor could he force himself to pay attention to what Nicholas was telling him about the Association .
he realized that this Association was merely an anchor to save his brother from self @@@ -@@ @ contempt .
all the profits on their labour , by which they might better their condition , give themselves some leisure , and consequently gain some education , all this surplus value is taken away by the capitalists .
and our society has so shaped itself that the more the people work the richer the merchants and land@@ owners will become , while the people will remain beasts of burden for ever .
and this system must be changed , ' he concluded , with an inqu@@ iring look at his brother .
'@@ Yes , of course , ' said Constan@@ tine , looking int@@ ently at the hec@@ tic flush which had appeared on his brother 's face below its prominent cheek bones .
'@@ And so we are starting a lock@@ s@@ mi@@ ths ' Association , in which all the products and the profits and , above all , the instruments of production will be common property . '
'@@ Where will the business be ? ' asked Constan@@ tine .
why start a lock@@ s@@ mi@@ ths ' Association there ? '
Constan@@ tine sigh@@ ed and at the same time looked round the room which was dismal and dirty .
the sigh seemed to irrit@@ ate Nicholas still more .
'@@ i know your arist@@ ocratic outlook and Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich 's .
I know that he uses all the powers of his mind to justify the existing evils . '
'@@ But why talk about Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich ? ' said Levin with a smile .
this is why ! ' suddenly shouted Nicholas at the mention of the name . ' this is why .
one thing only ...
why have you come here ?
you desp@@ ise it , well , that is all right - then go away . go , go in God 's name ! ' he exclaimed , rising from his chair .
'@@ i do not desp@@ ise it at all , ' Constan@@ tine replied me@@ ek@@ ly . ' I do not even dispute it . '
meanwhile Mary Nikol@@ av@@ na had come back .
Nicholas gave her an angry look .
'@@ i am not well and have grown irrit@@ able , ' said Nicholas , breathing heavily and qui@@ eting down . ' and you talk to me about Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich and his article .
it is such rub@@ bish , such hum@@ bug , such self @@@ -@@ @ deception .
what can a man write about justice , who does not understand it ? '
'@@ Have you read his article ? ' he said , turning to K@@ rit@@ sky again , sitting down to the table and clearing away from it a heap of half @@@ -@@ @ filled cigarettes to make room .
'@@ i have not read it , ' said K@@ rit@@ sky mor@@ os@@ ely , evidently not wishing to join in the conversation .
'@@ Why not ? ' irrit@@ ably answered Nicholas , still addressing K@@ rit@@ sky .
'@@ Because I consider it unnecessary to waste time on it . '
'@@ What do you mean ? may I ask how you knew it would waste your time ?
that article is incomprehensible to many ; I mean it is above them .
but it is a different matter with me . I see through his thought , and therefore know why it is weak . '
K@@ rit@@ sky rose and took up his hat .
'@@ Don '@@ t you want any sup@@ per ?
as soon as K@@ rit@@ sky had gone out , Nicholas smiled and win@@ ked .
but at that moment K@@ rit@@ sky called him from outside the door .
'@@ What do you want now ? ' said Nicholas and went out into the passage .
left alone with Mary Nikol@@ av@@ na , Levin spoke to her .
'@@ Have you been long with my brother ? ' he asked .
'@@ Yes , it is the second year now .
his health is very bad , he drinks too much , ' she said .
'@@ Re@@ ally - what does he drink ? '
'@@ Yes , ' she said looking tim@@ idly toward the door , just as Nicholas returned .
'@@ What were you talking about ? ' he asked fro@@ w@@ ning and looking from one to the other with frightened eyes . ' what was it ? '
'@@ No@@ thing , ' replied Levin in confusion .
only you have no business to talk to her .
'@@ Nicholas Dmit@@ rich , Nicholas Dmit@@ rich , ' whispered Mary Nikol@@ av@@ na , again approaching him .
come , have a drink .
tell me what you are doing , ' he continued , gre@@ ed@@ ily chew@@ ing a cr@@ ust of bread and filling himself another glass . ' how are you getting on ? '
'@@ i am living alone in the country , as I did before , and I look after the farming , ' answered Constan@@ tine , observing with horror how gre@@ ed@@ ily his brother ate and drank , and trying not to let it be seen that he noticed it .
'@@ Why don '@@ t you get married ? '
'@@ i had not the chance , ' replied Constan@@ tine bl@@ ushing .
'@@ Why not ?
I have spo@@ ilt my life .
I have said , and still say , that if I had been given my share of the property when I wanted it , everything would have been different . '
Constan@@ tine ha@@ st@@ ened to change the subject .
'@@ Do you know that your V@@ any@@ usha is now a cler@@ k in my office at Pok@@ rovsk ? ' he said .
Nicholas jer@@ ked his head and grew thoughtful .
'@@ Yes , tell me what is happening in Pok@@ rovsk Is the house still standing , and the birch trees , and our school@@ room ?
and is Philip the gar@@ den@@ er really still living ?
mind , don '@@ t change anything in the house , but get married soon and set things going again as they used to be .
then I will come to you if you have a good wife . '
'@@ Come to me at once , ' said Levin . ' how well we might settle down there ! '
'@@ i would come if I were sure I should not find Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich there . '
'@@ You won '@@ t find him there .
I live quite apart from him . '
'@@ still , say what you will , you must choose between him and me , ' said Nicholas with a tim@@ id look at his brother .
'@@ If you want my full confession about it , I will tell you that I take no side in your quarrel with Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich .
you are both to blame : you more in external matters and he more in essential ones . '
then you have grasped it , you have grasped it ? ' joy@@ fully exclaimed Nicholas .
'@@ But personally , if you care to know it , I value your friendship more because ... '
Constan@@ tine could not tell him that it was because Nicholas was unfortunate and needed friendship .
but Nicholas understood that he meant just that , and fro@@ w@@ ning , again took hold of the vodka bottle .
leave me alone !
I 'll thr@@ ash you ! ' shouted he .
Mary Nikol@@ av@@ na gave a mild , kindly smile , which ev@@ oked one from Nicholas , and she took away the bottle .
'@@ Do you think she do@@ es@@ n '@@ t understand ? ' said Nicholas . ' she understands it all better than any of us .
there really is something good and sweet about her . '
'@@ You were never in Moscow before ? ' Constan@@ tine asked very pol@@ itely , just in order to say something .
'@@ Don '@@ t speak to her in that way .
it fri@@ ghten@@ s her .
and he began to relate all his encounters with these new institutions .
Constan@@ tine Levin listened to him , and the condemnation of the social institutions , which he shared with him and had often expressed , was unpleasant to him when he heard it from his brother 's lips .
'@@ We shall understand it better in the next world , ' he said play@@ fully .
would you like some champagne ?
his speech began to grow confused and he jumped from one subject to another .
M@@ asha promised to write to Constan@@ tine in case of need , and to try to persuade Nicholas to go and live with him .
next M@@ OR@@ N@@ ING Constan@@ tine Levin LE@@ FT M@@ OSC@@ O@@ W and toward evening he reached home .
he felt that he was himself and did not wish to be anyone else .
he only wished now to be better than he had been formerly .
secondly , he would never again allow himself to be carried away by passion , the re@@ pul@@ sive memory of which had so tor@@ m@@ ented him when he was making up his mind to propose .
and he felt that that would be soon .
then his brother 's talk about communism , which he had taken lightly at the time , now made him think .
a light fell on the snow @@@ -@@ @ covered space in front of the house from the windows of the room of his old nurse Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na , who now acted as his house@@ keeper .
L@@ aska , a set@@ ter bit@@ ch , ran out too , almost throwing Kuz@@ ma off his feet , and wh@@ ined and rub@@ bed herself against Levin 's knees , jumping up and wishing but not daring to put her front pa@@ ws on his chest .
when he saw all this , he was overcome by a mom@@ entary doubt of the possibility of starting the new life of which he had been dreaming on his way .
that was what the things said , but another voice within his soul was saying that one must not submit to the past and that one can do anything with oneself .
and obe@@ ying the latter voice he went to the corner where two thirty @@@ -@@ @ six pound dumb @@@ -@@ @ bells lay and began doing gymn@@ astic exercises with them to in@@ vigor@@ ate himself .
his ste@@ ward entered and said that , ' the Lord be thanked , ' everything was all right , but that the buck@@ wheat had burned in the new drying kil@@ n .
this news irrit@@ ated Levin .
the new kil@@ n had been built and partly invented by him .
the ste@@ ward had always been against the new kil@@ n , and now proclaimed with suppressed triumph that the buck@@ wheat had got burnt .
Levin felt quite certain that if it had been burnt it was only because the precautions about which he had given instructions over and over again had been neglected .
he was v@@ exed , and he re@@ pri@@ man@@ ded the ste@@ ward .
crossing the yard past the heap of snow by the l@@ il@@ ac bush , he reached the shed .
there was a warm ste@@ aming smell of man@@ ure when the frozen door opened , and the cows , astonished at the un@@ accustomed light of the lan@@ tern , began moving on their clean straw .
the cal@@ f f@@ um@@ bled about , pushing its nose under its mother 's belly and sw@@ inging its little tail .
'@@ Show a light here , Theodore , here , ' said Levin , examining the cal@@ f .
Vasily Fed@@ or@@ ich , is@@ n '@@ t she fine ? ' he said , turning to the ste@@ ward , and quite for@@ giving him for the buck@@ wheat under the influence of his satisfaction about the cal@@ f .
Simon the contractor , came the day after you left .
we shall have to employ him , Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich , ' said the ste@@ ward . ' I told you about the machine . '
it W@@ AS A large OL@@ D @@@ -@@ @ fashioned HO@@ USE , and though only Levin was living in it , he used and heated the whole of it .
he knew this to be foolish and even wrong , and contrary to his new plans , but this house was a whole world to Levin .
it was the world in which his father and mother had lived and died .
they had lived a life which appeared to him ideally perfect , and which he had dreamed of renew@@ ing with a wife and family of his own .
Levin could scarcely remember his mother .
his conception of her was to him a sacred memory , and in his imagination his future wife was to be a repetition of the enchan@@ ting and holy ideal of wom@@ an@@ hood that his mother had been .
he could not imagine the love of woman without marriage , and even pic@@ tured to himself a family first and then the woman who would give him the family .
and now he had to renounce it .
with her , or with another , they would come true .
he felt that in the depth of his soul something was settling down , adjusting and compos@@ ing itself .
it was a book of Ty@@ n@@ d@@ all 's on heat .
he recalled his dis@@ approval of Ty@@ n@@ d@@ all 's self @@@ -@@ @ conce@@ it concerning the cl@@ ever@@ ness of his experiments and his lack of a philosop@@ hic outlook .
'@@ Well , let us grant that electricity and heat are one and the same , but can we substitute the one quantity for the other in solving an equation ?
it will be especially good when P@@ AV@@ A 's cal@@ f is already a red @@@ -@@ @ mo@@ tt@@ led cow , and the whole herd in which these three will be ... !
my wife will say : " we , Constan@@ tine and I , re@@ ared this cal@@ f like a baby . "
" all that interests him interests me .. "
'@@ Well , what is to be done ? ...
but now everything will be on new lines .
it is nonsense to say that life will prevent it , that the past prevents it .
I must struggle to live a better , a far better , life . '
'@@ She all but speaks , ' said Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na .
'@@ Why depressed ? '
Levin looked at her int@@ ently , surprised that she knew so well what was in his mind .
'@@ Sh@@ all I bring you a little more tea ? ' she said and went out with his cup .
L@@ aska kept on pushing her head under his hand .
he pat@@ ted her a little , and she cur@@ led herself up at his feet with her head on her out@@ stretched h@@ ind pa@@ w .
and to show that all was now well and satisfactory , she slightly opened her mouth , sm@@ acked her sticky lips , and drawing them more closely over her old teeth lay still in blis@@ s@@ ful peace .
Levin attentively watched this last movement of hers .
early IN THE M@@ OR@@ N@@ ING after the ball Anna sent a tel@@ eg@@ ram to her husband to say that she was leaving Moscow that same evening .
Stephen O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky was not dining at home , but promised to be back at seven to see his sister off .
Dol@@ ly and Anna d@@ ined alone with the children and their English govern@@ ess .
Anna spent the whole morning preparing for her departure : writing notes to her Moscow acquaintances , making up accounts , and packing .
after dinner Anna went to her room to dress and Dol@@ ly followed her .
'@@ How strange you are to @@@ -@@ @ day ! ' said Dol@@ ly
'@@ i ? do you think so ?
I am not strange , but wicked .
it sometimes happens to me .
I feel ready to cry .
it is very silly , but it will pass , ' said Anna hur@@ ri@@ edly , and she bent her fl@@ ushed face over the tiny bag into which she was packing a night @@@ -@@ @ cap and some lawn hand@@ ker@@ chiefs .
her eyes shone peculi@@ arly and kept filling with tears . ' I did not want to leave Petersburg , and now I do not want to leave here . '
'@@ You came here and did a good action , ' said Dol@@ ly , scrutin@@ izing her attentively .
'@@ Do not say that , Dol@@ ly .
I have done and could do nothing .
I often wonder why people consp@@ ire to spoil me .
what have I done and what could I do ?
there was enough love in your heart to forgive ... '
'@@ But for you , God only knows what would have happened !
how lucky you are , Anna , ' said Dol@@ ly . ' everything in your soul is clear and good . '
'@@ Every one has a skeleton in their cu@@ pboard , as the English say . '
'@@ What skeleton have you ?
everything about you is so clear . '
'@@ i have one ! ' said Anna , and unexpectedly following her tears , a sly , hum@@ orous smile p@@ uck@@ ered her lips .
and to her surprise Dol@@ ly saw that Anna was bl@@ ushing to her ears and to the cur@@ ly black locks on her neck .
'@@ Do you know , ' continued Anna , ' why Kit@@ ty did not come to dinner ?
I have spoiled ... I mean I was the cause of the ball being a torture instead of a pleasure to her .
'@@ Oh , how like Steve you said that , ' remarked Dol@@ ly laughing .
Anna was anno@@ yed .
'@@ Oh no , no , I am not Steve , ' she said fro@@ w@@ ning . ' the reason I have told you is that I do not even for a moment allow myself to distrust myself . '
'@@ You C@@ AN@@ NOT think how que@@ erly it came about .
perhaps against my own will I ... '
she bl@@ ushed and stopped .
'@@ Oh , they feel that at once ! ' said Dol@@ ly .
'@@ But I should be in despair if there were anything serious in it on his side , ' Anna interrupted her . ' I am sure that it will all be forgotten , and Kit@@ ty will no longer hate me . '
Oh , what a dar@@ ling she is !
but you will put it right ?
Dol@@ ly could hardly re@@ press a smile .
she was fond of Anna , but it was pleasant to find that she too had a weakness .
that is impossible . '
she d@@ ab@@ bed her face with her hand@@ ker@@ chief , and began to dress .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , sm@@ elling of wine and ci@@ gars , with his face red and happy , came in late , just as she was about to start .
Anna 's emotion had spread to Dol@@ ly , who as she embraced her sister @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law for the last time whispered :
'@@ i do not know why you should , ' said Anna , kis@@ sing her and trying to hide her tears .
'@@ You understood and understand me .
she sat down beside her maid Ann@@ ush@@ ka , and pe@@ ered round the dim@@ ly @@@ -@@ @ lit sleeping compartment .
'@@ Than@@ k Heaven , to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row I shall see Ser@@ ez@@ ha and Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich again , and my good accustomed life will go on as of old . '
at first she could not read .
Ann@@ ush@@ ka was already do@@ zing , her broad hands , with a hole in one of the gloves , holding the red bag on her lap .
Anna read and understood , but it was unpleasant to read , that is to say , to follow the reflection of other people 's lives .
she was too eager to live herself .
but there was nothing to be done , so she forced herself to read , while her little hand to@@ yed with the smooth paper @@@ -@@ @ knife .
'@@ What am I ashamed of ? ' she asked herself with indig@@ n@@ ant surprise .
she put down her book , leaned back , and cl@@ as@@ ped the paper @@@ -@@ @ knife tightly in both hands .
they were all good and pleasant .
she recalled the ball and V@@ ron@@ sky and his humble , enam@@ oured gaze , and their relations with one another ; there was nothing to be ashamed of .
'@@ Well , what of it ? ' she finally said to herself with decision , changing her position on the seat . ' what does it signi@@ fy ?
what of it ?
just as if there existed , or could exist , between me and this officer @@@ -@@ @ l@@ ad any relations differing from those with other acquaintances . '
she smiled disd@@ ain@@ fully and again took up her book ; but now she absolutely could not understand what she was reading .
she passed her paper @@@ -@@ @ knife over the wind@@ ow@@ pane , then pressed its cold smooth surface against her cheek and almost laughed aloud , suddenly overcome with un@@ reasoning joy .
she felt that her nerves were being stretched like strings drawn tighter and tighter round pe@@ gs .
was it Ann@@ ush@@ ka who was sitting beside her , or a stranger ?
'@@ And am I here , myself ?
something seemed to draw her to them , but she had the power to give way to them or to resist .
to get over it she rose , threw off her wrap , and took off the cape of her coat .
but all this did not seem dreadful , but am@@ using .
the voice of a man wrapped up and covered with snow shouted something just above her ear .
she rose and came to herself , understanding that they had stopped at a station and that this was the guard .
she asked Ann@@ ush@@ ka to give her the cape she had removed and a sha@@ w@@ l , and putting them on she moved to the door .
'@@ are you going out ? ' asked Ann@@ ush@@ ka .
'@@ Yes , I want a breath of air .
she opened the carriage door .
the snow and wind rushed toward her and had a t@@ us@@ s@@ le with her for the door .
and this too struck her as am@@ using .
she went out .
with enjoyment she drew in full bre@@ aths of the snow@@ y , fro@@ sty air as she stood beside her carriage looking round at the platform and the lighted station .
a blu@@ stering storm W@@ AS rushing and whist@@ ling between the wheels of the train and round the pillars and the corners of the station .
the railway carriages , the pillars , the people , and everything that could be seen , were covered on one side with snow , and that covering became th@@ icker and th@@ icker .
a mom@@ entary l@@ ull would be followed by such a terri@@ fic gust that it seemed hardly possible to stand against it .
yet people , mer@@ r@@ ily exchanging remarks , ran over the cre@@ aking boards of the platform , and the big station doors were constantly being opened and shut .
the shadow of a man sto@@ oping slipped past her feet and she heard a hammer striking the carriage wheels .
'@@ Let me have the tel@@ eg@@ ram ! ' came an angry voice from the other side out of the stor@@ my darkness .
'@@ Here , please , No. 28 ! ' cried other voices , while many people mu@@ ff@@ led up and covered with snow ran hi@@ ther and thi@@ ther .
with his hand in sal@@ ute , he bowed and asked if she wanted anything and whether he could be of any service to her .
for some time she looked into his face without answering , and , though he stood in the shade she noticed , or thought she noticed , the expression of his face and eyes .
it was the same expression of respectful ecstasy that had so affected her the night before .
there was no need for her to ask him why he was there .
she knew as well as if he had told her , that he was there in order to be where she was .
why are you going ? ' she asked , dropping the hand with which she was about to take hold of the hand@@ rail .
her face be@@ amed with a joy and animation she could not re@@ press .
'@@ Why am I going ? ' he repeated , looking straight into her eyes . ' you know that I am going in order to be where you are , ' said he . ' I C@@ AN@@ NOT do otherwise . '
the aw@@ fulness of the storm appeared still more beautiful to her now .
he had said just what , her soul desired but her reason dread@@ ed .
he spoke cour@@ te@@ ously and respec@@ tfully , but so firmly and stubbor@@ nly that she was long unable to reply .
'@@ What you are saying is wrong , and if you are a good man , I beg you to forget it , as I will forget it , ' she said at last .
'@@ Not a word , not a movement of yours will I ever forget , nor can I ... '
'@@ En@@ ough , enough ! ' she cried , v@@ ain@@ ly trying to give a severe expression to her face , into which he was gaz@@ ing eagerly .
she took hold of the cold hand@@ rail , asc@@ ended the steps , and quickly entered the little lobby leading into the carriage .
but in that little lobby she stopped , going over in her imagination what had just taken place .
though she could remember neither his nor her own words , she instinc@@ tively felt that that mom@@ entary conversation had drawn them terribly near to one another , and this both frightened her and made her happy .
after standing still for a few seconds she went into the carriage and sat down .
the over@@ wrought condition which tor@@ m@@ ented her before not only returned again , but grew worse and reached such a degree that she feared every moment that something within her would give way under the intolerable strain .
she did not sleep at all that night , but the strain and the visions which filled her imagination had nothing unpleasant or dismal about them ; on the contrary they seemed joyful , glowing , and stimulating .
toward morning Anna , while still sitting up , fell into a do@@ ze ; when she woke it was already light and the train was approaching Petersburg .
at once thoughts of home , her husband , her son , and the cares of the coming day and of those that would follow , bes@@ et her .
when the train stopped at the Petersburg termin@@ us and she got out , the first face she noticed was that of her husband .
when he saw her , he came toward her with his customary ir@@ on@@ ical smile and looked straight at her with his large tired eyes .
an unpleasant feeling weighed on her heart when she felt his fixed and weary gaze , as if she had expected to find him different .
she was particularly struck by the feeling of dissatisfaction with herself which she experienced when she met him .
it was that ordinary well @@@ -@@ @ known feeling , as if she were dissem@@ bling , which she experienced in regard to her husband , but formerly she had not noticed it , while now she was clearly and painfully conscious of it .
'@@ And is this all the reward I get , ' he said , ' for my ard@@ our ?
V@@ ron@@ sky D@@ ID NOT EV@@ EN TR@@ Y TO S@@ LE@@ EP that night .
he looked at people as if they were in@@ anim@@ ate things .
a nervous young man , a Law Court official , who sat opposite , hated him for that look .
V@@ ron@@ sky neither saw nor heard anyone .
he felt himself a king , not because he believed that he had made an impression on Anna - he did not yet believe that - but because the impression she had made on him filled him with happiness and pride .
what would come of it all he did not know and did not even consider .
he felt that all his powers , hitherto dissip@@ ated and scattered , were now concentrated and directed with terrible energy toward one blis@@ s@@ ful aim .
this made him happy .
he knew only that he had told her the truth : that he would go where she went , that all the happiness of life and the only meaning of life for him now was in seeing and hearing her .
when he had got out of the train at B@@ olo@@ go@@ e station to drink a glass of Sel@@ t@@ zer water and had seen Anna , he had involun@@ tarily at once told her just what he was thinking about it .
he was glad he had said it to her , and that she now knew it and was thinking about it .
he did not sleep at all that night .
when he returned to the train , he kept recalling all the positions in which he had seen her , and all her words ; and in his imagination , causing his heart to stand still , floated pictures of a possible future .
when he got out of the train at Petersburg he felt , despite his sle@@ e@@ pless night , as fresh and animated as after a cold bath .
he stopped outside the carriage , waiting till she appeared .
'@@ i shall see her again , ' he thought and smiled involun@@ tarily . ' I shall see her walk , her face ... she will say something , turn her head , look at me , perhaps even smile . '
but before seeing her he saw her husband , whom the station @@@ -@@ @ master was respec@@ tfully conducting through the crowd .
only now did V@@ ron@@ sky for the first time clearly realize that the husband was connected with her .
K@@ aren@@ in 's g@@ ait , the sw@@ inging of his thi@@ gh@@ s , and his wide short feet , particularly offended V@@ ron@@ sky , who acknowledged only his own un@@ questionable right to love Anna .
but she was still the same , and the sight of her still affected him physically , ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating and stimulating him and filling him with joy .
he saw the husband and wife meet , and with the penetration of a lover he noticed the signs of slight embarrassment when she spoke to her husband .
'@@ no , she do@@ es@@ n '@@ t and can '@@ t love him , ' he decided mentally .
while he was approaching her from behind he observed with joy that she became aware of his approach and was about to turn but , on recognizing him , again addressed her husband .
'@@ Yes , quite comfortable , thank you , ' she replied .
K@@ aren@@ in looked at him with dis@@ pleasure , abs@@ ently trying to recall who he might be .
V@@ ron@@ sky 's calm self @@@ -@@ @ confidence struck like a sc@@ y@@ the on a stone against the cold self @@@ -@@ @ confidence of K@@ aren@@ in .
'@@ Count V@@ ron@@ sky , ' said Anna .
by addressing himself thus to his wife he conveyed to V@@ ron@@ sky his wish to be alone with her , and turning to V@@ ron@@ sky he touched his hat . but V@@ ron@@ sky , addressing Anna , said :
'@@ i hope to have the honour of calling on you . '
K@@ aren@@ in glanced at him with his weary eyes .
'@@ You insist too much on your devotion , for me to value it greatly , ' she replied in the same play@@ ful tone , while she involun@@ tarily listened to the sound of V@@ ron@@ sky 's footsteps following them .
'@@ But what does he matter to me ? ' she asked herself , and began inqu@@ iring of her husband how Ser@@ ez@@ ha had got on during her absence .
Mari@@ ette says he was very sweet . but - I 'm sorry to gri@@ eve you ! - he did not fre@@ t after you ... like your husband ! ...
our dear sam@@ ov@@ ar will be in ec@@ st@@ asi@@ es . '
( he called the celebrated Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna sam@@ ov@@ ar because she was always getting heated and boiling over about something . )
and , do you know , if I may advise , you should go and see her to @@@ -@@ @ day .
her heart is always aching about somebody .
Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna was Anna 's husband 's friend and the centre of that set in Petersburg Society with which Anna , through her husband , was most closely connected .
'@@ But I wrote to her . '
'@@ Yes , but she wants the particul@@ ars .
now I Sh@@ an '@@ t have to dine alone , ' he went on , no longer in a ban@@ tering manner . ' you can '@@ t think how I used ... '
and with a long pressure of her hand and a special kind of smile he helped her into the carriage .
the FI@@ R@@ ST PER@@ SON TO ME@@ ET AN@@ NA when she reached home was her son .
he ran down the stairs to her regardless of his govern@@ ess 's cries , and with desperate delight called out : ' M@@ ama ! M@@ ama ! '
when he reached her he cl@@ ung round her neck .
'@@ i told you it was M@@ ama ! ' he shouted to the govern@@ ess .
'@@ i knew ! ' her son , like his father , produced on Anna a feeling akin to disappointment .
her fancy had pic@@ tured him nic@@ er than he was in reality .
she had to come down to reality in order to enjoy him as he was .
but even as he was , he was charming , with his fair cur@@ ls , blue eyes and pl@@ ump shap@@ ely legs in tight @@@ -@@ @ fitting stock@@ ings .
Anna experienced an almost physical pleasure in feeling his proximity and his ca@@ resses , and a moral sol@@ ace when she met his simple , trust@@ ful , and loving gaze and heard his naive questions .
she un@@ packed the presents which Dol@@ ly 's children had sent him , and told him that there was a girl in Moscow whose name was T@@ anya , who could read and even teach other children .
'@@ And am I worse than she ? ' asked Ser@@ ez@@ ha .
'@@ i know , ' he said , smiling .
before Anna had time to finish her coffee the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna was announced .
the Countess was a tall , st@@ out woman with a sick@@ ly sal@@ low compl@@ exi@@ on and beautiful , dream@@ y , black eyes .
Anna was fond of her , but to @@@ -@@ @ day she seemed to see her for the first time with all her defects .
'@@ Well , my dear ! did you take the olive branch ? ' asked the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna as soon as she entered the room .
'@@ Yes , it 's all over ; but the whole affair was not as serious as we thought , ' Anna replied . ' my sister @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law is , in general , too impul@@ sive . '
but the Countess , who was interested in everything that did not concern her , had a habit of never listening to what interested her , and she interrupted Anna :
'@@ Why ! what is the matter ? ' asked Anna , trying to suppress a smile .
'@@ i am getting tired of breaking lan@@ ces us@@ el@@ essly in the cause of truth , and sometimes I feel quite un@@ str@@ ung .
two or three , your husband among them , understand the full significance of the affair , but the others just drop it .
Prav@@ din was a well @@@ -@@ @ known P@@ ans@@ lav@@ ist who resi@@ ded abroad . the Countess told Anna what he had written .
'@@ This is all just as it was before , but how is it that I never noticed it before ? ' said Anna to herself . ' or is it that she is specially irrit@@ ated this morning ?
but it is really funny ; her aim is to do good , she is a Christian and yet she is always angry and always has enemies - all on account of Christianity and philanthrop@@ y ! '
after the Countess had left , a friend - a high official 's wife - arrived and gave Anna all the Petersburg news .
at three she also left , promising to come back to dinner .
K@@ aren@@ in was at the Ministry .
the feeling of ca@@ useless shame she had felt during the journey , and her agitation , had quite vanished .
in her accustomed conditions of life she again felt firm and bl@@ am@@ eless .
'@@ What had happened ?
nothing !
V@@ ron@@ sky said some silly things , to which it will be easy to put a stop , and I said what was necessary .
it is unnecessary and impossible to speak of it to my husband .
to speak of it would be to give it an importance that does not belong to it . '
'@@ So there is no need to tell him !
besides ; thank Heaven there is nothing to tell ! ' she said to herself .
K@@ aren@@ in returned FROM THE MIN@@ IS@@ TR@@ Y at four o 'clock , but , as often happened , he had no time to go up and see his wife .
he went straight to his study to receive some peti@@ tion@@ ers and sign a few documents brought by his private secretary .
Anna went into the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room to entertain them .
every moment of his life was filled up and ap@@ por@@ tioned , and in order to find time to perform all the tasks allo@@ tted to each day he observed the stric@@ test regularity .
'@@ Without ha@@ ste and without rest , ' was his motto .
he entered the room , greeted everybody , and quickly sat down , smiling at his wife .
'@@ So my sol@@ itude has come to an end .
at dinner he spoke a little about Moscow affairs with his wife , asking with an ir@@ on@@ ical smile after Stephen O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky ; but for the most part the conversation was general and dealt with Petersburg service and social affairs .
after dinner he spent half an hour with his guests , and then , having again with a smile pressed his wife 's hand , went away to the Council .
that evening Anna went neither to see the Princess Bet@@ sy T@@ ver@@ skaya , who having heard of Anna 's return had invited her , nor to the theatre , where she had a box for that evening .
her chief reason for not going was that a dress on which she had counted was not ready .
before going to Moscow , she - being an adept at dressing on comparatively little money - left three dresses to be altered .
the d@@ res@@ sm@@ aker came to explain that it was better as she had done it , and Anna lost her tem@@ per to such a degree that she afterwards felt ashamed .
she sat down by the fire with an English novel and awaited her husband .
exactly at half @@@ -@@ @ past nine there was a ring at the front door , and he entered the room .
'@@ in general , I see that your journey has been a success , ' said he .
'@@ Yes , quite , ' she replied , and related everything that had happened from the beginning : her journey with the Countess V@@ ron@@ skaya , her arrival , the accident at the railway station .
'@@ i don '@@ t think that one can excuse such a man , even though he is your brother , ' remarked K@@ aren@@ in , severely .
she knew he had said that in order to show that no consideration of kin@@ ship could hinder the expression of his sincere opinion .
she knew that trait in her husband 's character , knew and liked it .
'@@ i am glad it has all ended satis@@ factor@@ ily and that you are back again , ' he continued . ' but what are they saying there about the new Statute I carried in the Council ? '
Anna had heard nothing about the Statute , and felt ashamed that she had so lightly forgotten what was of such importance to him .
'@@ Here , on the contrary , it has made quite a stir , ' he said with a self @@@ -@@ @ satisfied smile .
Anna saw that he wanted to tell her something pleasant to himself about that affair , and by questioning she led him on to tell her all about it .
with the same self @@@ -@@ @ satisfied smile he told her about the ov@@ ations he had received on account of the en@@ ac@@ tment of that Statute .
'@@ i was very , very pleased .
it shows that at last a clear and reasonable view of the matter is beginning to be firmly held among us . '
having finished his second cup of tea and cream and his bread and butter , he rose and went into his study .
'@@ And have you not been out anywhere ? you must have been dull , ' he said .
'@@ Oh no ! ' she answered , rising and following him through the room to his study . ' and what are you reading now ? ' she asked .
'@@ i am now reading the Du@@ c de L@@ ille 's Po@@ é@@ si@@ e des en@@ fers , he replied . ' a very remarkable book . '
Anna smiled , as one smiles at the weaknesses of people one loves , and slipping her hand under his arm walked with him to the study door .
she knew that in spite of his time being almost entirely absorbed by the duties of his post , he considered it incumbent on him to follow everything of importance that appeared in the world of thought .
he liked talking of Shakespeare , Rap@@ hael and Be@@ eth@@ oven , and about the importance of the new schools of poetry and music , which in his mind were all classified with very logical ex@@ acti@@ tude .
he pressed her hand and again kis@@ sed it .
'@@ It 's time ! it 's time ! ' said he with a peculiar smile , going into their bedroom .
'@@ And what right had he to look at him as he did ? ' thought Anna , remembering how V@@ ron@@ sky had looked at K@@ aren@@ in .
when H@@ E W@@ ENT TO Moscow , V@@ ron@@ sky had left his large flat on the Mor@@ skaya to his friend and favourite com@@ rade , Petr@@ itsky .
arriving home from the station about noon , V@@ ron@@ sky recognized a hired br@@ ou@@ g@@ ham at the front door .
when he rang the bell , while still outside , he heard men 's laughter , a woman 's lis@@ ping voice , and Petr@@ itsky shouting : ' if it is one of the vill@@ ains , don '@@ t let him in ! '
V@@ ron@@ sky told the servants not to announce his arrival , and softly entered the first room .
Petr@@ itsky 's friend , the Bar@@ on@@ ess Chil@@ ton , her l@@ il@@ ac s@@ atin dress and pink and white face g@@ listening , and like a can@@ ary filling the whole room with her Pari@@ sian voice , was seated at the round table making coffee .
Petr@@ itsky in his great coat , and Captain Kam@@ er@@ ovsky in full uniform probably straight from parade , sat on each side of her .
Bra@@ vo ! ' exclaimed Petr@@ itsky jumping up and nois@@ ily pushing back his chair . ' the master himself !
I hope you are pleased with this or@@ nament to your study , ' he added , pointing to the Bar@@ on@@ ess . ' of course , you know one another ? '
'@@ i should think so ! ' replied V@@ ron@@ sky with a mer@@ ry smile , as he pressed the Bar@@ on@@ ess 's small hand . ' of course : quite old friends . '
'@@ You have returned from a journey ? ' said the Bar@@ on@@ ess .
'@@ You are at home where you are , Bar@@ on@@ ess , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky . ' how do you do , Kam@@ er@@ ovsky ? ' he added , col@@ dly shaking hands with the Captain .
'@@ There now ! you never manage to say such pretty things , ' said the Bar@@ on@@ ess to Petr@@ itsky .
'@@ Oh yes ! why not ?
and your wife ? ' the Bar@@ on@@ ess said suddenly , interrup@@ ting V@@ ron@@ sky 's conversation with his com@@ rade . ' we here have been mar@@ rying you off !
and the Bar@@ on@@ ess , instead of releasing V@@ ron@@ sky , began telling him her plans for the future , inter@@ s@@ pers@@ ing jokes and asking his advice .
'@@ He won '@@ t agree to a divorce !
whatever am I to do ? '
'@@ i want to begin an action .
what would you advise ?
Kam@@ er@@ ovsky , mind the coffee , it 's boiling over ! Don '@@ t you see I am occupied ? ...
I want to bring an action because I need my property .
you see how absurd it is , that because I am supposed to be un@@ faithful , ' she said cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ously , ' he wishes to have the use of my property . '
V@@ ron@@ sky listened with pleasure to the mer@@ ry pr@@ attle of the pretty young woman , agreed with what she said , and half in fun gave her advice ; in a word he immediately took up his habitual manner with women of her kind .
in his Petersburg world people were divided into two quite opposite sorts .
these were the old @@@ -@@ @ fashioned and ridiculous people .
the coffee never got made , but boiled over and spl@@ ashed everybody , eff@@ ecting just what was required : that is , it gave an excuse for much noise and laughter , st@@ aining the valuable carpet and the Bar@@ on@@ ess 's dress .
'@@ Now good @@@ -@@ @ bye , or you 'll never get washed , and on my conscience will lie the greatest crime of a gentleman - want of cleanliness ...
'@@ Most certainly , and hold it so that your hand will be near his lips .
he will kiss the hand and all will end well ! ' said V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ Then we meet at the French Theatre to @@@ -@@ @ night ? ' and , her dress ru@@ st@@ ling , she vanished .
Kam@@ er@@ ovsky rose also , and , without waiting for him to go , V@@ ron@@ sky shook hands with him and went to his dressing @@@ -@@ @ room .
while he was washing , Petr@@ itsky in a few words described his own position in so far as it had changed since V@@ ron@@ sky went away .
his tailor and another creditor were threatening him with arrest .
his C.@@ O. had announced to him that if these scandals continued he ( Petr@@ itsky ) would have to resign .
he had also had a quarrel with Ber@@ k@@ as@@ hev , who wished to send his seconds , but of course nothing would come of it .
but , in general , everything was first @@@ -@@ @ rate and extremely j@@ ol@@ ly ; and without letting his friend go into the details of his position Petr@@ itsky began telling him all the interesting news .
listening to Petr@@ itsky 's familiar tales , in the familiar surroundings of the house he had lived in for three years , V@@ ron@@ sky experienced the satisfaction of returning to his customary ca@@ reless Petersburg life .
'@@ Oh , about Bu@@ z@@ ul@@ ukov there is such a tale - splendid ! ' shouted Petr@@ itsky . ' you know his passion for balls ?
he never misses a single Court ball .
'@@ Yes , I am , ' replied V@@ ron@@ sky , rubbing himself with a bath @@@ -@@ @ towel .
'@@ the Grand Duchess passed by with one of the Ambassad@@ ors , and as his ill @@@ -@@ @ luck would have it they were discussing the new hel@@ mets .
she sees our dear Bu@@ z@@ ul@@ ukov standing there ' - Petr@@ itsky im@@ itated the pose ' the Grand Duchess asks him for his helmet , but he won '@@ t let her have it !
no !
just imagine it ! ...
that - what 's his name ? wishes to take it from him , but he won '@@ t let go ...
" here , this is one of the new ones , " says the Grand Duchess , turning it over , and - just fancy ! - out tum@@ bles a pe@@ ar and sweets - two pounds of them ! ...
V@@ ron@@ sky shook with laughter , and long after , when he was already talking of other things , he again went off into ro@@ ars of hearty laughter , showing his compact row of strong teeth , at the rem@@ embrance of the helmet .
after that he intended to go to see his brother and to see Bet@@ sy , and to pay a few calls in order to begin visiting the set in which he could meet Anna K@@ aren@@ ina .
as usual in Petersburg , he left the house not to return till late at night .
toward THE EN@@ D OF THE WIN@@ TER a consultation was held at the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys ' which was intended to as@@ certain the state of Kit@@ ty 's health and to decide what should be done to restore her failing strength .
she was ill , and with the approach of spring grew worse .
the celebrated specialist , a very handsome man and by no means old , insisted on sounding the invalid .
after having carefully examined and sounded the ag@@ itated invalid , who was stu@@ pe@@ fied with shame , the celebrity , having carefully washed his hands , stood in the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room talking to the Prince . the Prince fro@@ w@@ ned and c@@ ough@@ ed as he listened to the doctor .
the doctor meanwhile found it hard not to show his contempt for the old fellow , and with difficulty descended to the level of his comprehension .
he saw that it was waste of time to talk to him , and that the head in this house was the mother .
it was before her that he meant to spread his pear@@ ls .
just then the Princess entered the room with the family doctor .
the Prince moved away , trying not to show how absurd he thought the whole far@@ ce .
the Princess was confused and did not know what to do .
'@@ Then we had better leave you ? '
'@@ as you please . '
when the doctors were alone , the family doctor began tim@@ idly to express his opinion , which was that a tuber@@ cul@@ ous process had begun , but ... etc .
the celebrity listened , but in the midst of the speech looked at his large gold watch .
'@@ Yes , ' said he , ' but ... '
'@@ We C@@ AN@@ NOT , as you know , determine the beginning of a tuber@@ cul@@ ous process . as long as there are no ca@@ vities there is nothing definite to go by .
the question is this : when a tuber@@ cul@@ ous process is suspected , what should be done to nour@@ ish the patient ? '
'@@ But you know in these cases there is always some hidden moral cause , ' the family doctor allowed himself to remark with a subtle smile .
we were saying that the question is this : how to nour@@ ish the patient and strengthen the nerves .
the two aims are connected , and we must act on both . '
you see , if a tuber@@ cul@@ ous process has begun ( which we don '@@ t know ) , a journey abroad will not help the case .
and the celebrity explained his plan of a treatment with So@@ den Water , the chief reason for prescri@@ bing this evidently being that it could do no harm .
'@@ But in favour of a journey abroad I should like to mention the change of habits , and the removal from surroundings which awaken memories .
besides which , the mother wishes it , ' said he .
'@@ ah , in that case let them go , only those German qu@@ acks will do mis@@ chief ...
they must obey ...
however , let them go . '
the celebrity informed the Princess ( his sense of what was fitting suggested this to him ) that he would have to see the patient again .
'@@ What , another examination ? ' exclaimed the mother , horror @@@ -@@ @ struck .
her thin cheeks were fl@@ ushed and her eyes were burning after the or@@ deal she had endured .
her whole illness and the treatment appeared to her stupid and even ridiculous .
her treatment seemed to her as absurd as pi@@ ec@@ ing together the bits of a sm@@ ashed v@@ ase .
her heart was broken .
why did they want to dose her with pills and pow@@ ders ?
but she did not want to pain her mother , especially as her mother considered herself to blame .
'@@ S@@ it down , please , Princess , ' said the celebrity .
he sat down opposite to her , smiling , felt her pulse and again began asking ti@@ res@@ ome questions .
she answered him , but suddenly grew angry and rose .
you are asking me the same things three times over . '
the celebrity was not offended .
and to the Princess , as to an exceptionally intelligent woman , the doctor diagnosed Kit@@ ty 's condition in learned language , and concluded with directions how the unnecessary waters were to be drunk .
it was just as if something pleasant had happened when the doctor had gone , and Kit@@ ty too pre@@ tended to be cheerful .
she often now , almost always , had to pretend .
but if you wish to travel , let us go ! ' and trying to appear interested in the journey she began to talk about the preparations for it .
'@@ Well , how is she ? ' she said , entering the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room without removing her bon@@ net .
they tried to tell her what the doctor had said , but it turned out that though he had spoken very flu@@ ently and at great length , it was impossible to reproduce what he had said .
the only thing of interest was that it had been decided they should go abroad .
her relations with her husband after their reconciliation had become humiliating .
Anna 's sol@@ dering had not proved durable , and the family harmony had broken again at the same place .
there was nothing definite , but O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky was hardly ever at home , there was hardly ever any money , and suspicions of his in@@ fidelity continually tor@@ m@@ ented Dol@@ ly , who tried to repe@@ l them , fearing the already familiar p@@ ang@@ s of jealousy .
the first explosion of jealousy , once past , could not be repeated . not even the discovery of an act of in@@ fidelity could again affect her as it had done the first time .
such a discovery could now only deprive her of her accustomed family life , and she let herself be deceived , desp@@ ising him , and especially herself , for such weakness .
added to this the care of a large family worried her continually : either something went wrong with the feeding of the baby or the nurse left , or , as now , one of the children fell ill .
'@@ And how are you all getting on ? ' asked her mother .
'@@ ah , M@@ ama , we have plenty of trouble of our own .
L@@ ily has fallen ill , and I 'm afraid it 's scar@@ let fever .
the old Prince came out of his study after the doctor had gone , and after giving his cheek to Dol@@ ly and greeting her he turned to his wife :
and what are you going to do with me ? '
'@@ i think you should stay behind , Alexander , ' replied his wife .
'@@ M@@ ama , why should not Pap@@ a come with us ? ' said Kit@@ ty . ' it would be pleas@@ an@@ ter for him and for us too . '
the old Prince rose and stro@@ ked Kit@@ ty 's hair .
she lifted her face and , forcing a smile , looked up at him .
she always felt that he understood her better than anyone else in the family , though he did not speak much to her .
being the youngest she was his favourite , and it seemed to her that his affection gave him insight .
when her gaze now met his kindly blue eyes looking steadily at her , it seemed to her that he saw right through her , and knew all the trouble that was in her .
she bent toward him , bl@@ ushing , and expecting a kiss , but he only pat@@ ted her on the head and remarked :
'@@ These stupid ch@@ ign@@ ons !
one can '@@ t get at one 's real daughter , but only ca@@ resses the hair of expired females .
well , Dol@@ ly , ' he said , turning to his el@@ dest daughter , ' and what is your pro@@ dig@@ al about ? '
'@@ No@@ thing particular , Pap@@ a , ' answered Dol@@ ly , understanding that he referred to her husband . ' he is always out , I hardly see him , ' - she could not resist adding with an ir@@ on@@ ical smile .
'@@ And has he not yet gone to the country to sell the forest ? '
'@@ Dear me ! ' said the Prince . ' and so I am also to prepare ?
her father 's words seemed very simple , but they made Kit@@ ty feel as confused and fl@@ ur@@ ried as a detected criminal .
'@@ Yes , he knows and understands it all , and in these words is telling me that , though I am ashamed , I must get over my shame . '
she could not gather spirit enough to reply .
she made an attempt , but suddenly burst into tears and ran away .
the Princess flew at her husband : ' that comes of your jokes . you always ... ' and she began repro@@ aching him .
the Prince listened for some time to her rebu@@ kes in silence , but his face fro@@ w@@ ned more and more .
'@@ She is so p@@ iti@@ ful , poor thing , so p@@ iti@@ ful , and you don '@@ t feel that every all@@ usion to what has caused it hurts her .
there always have been and there still are laws against such fellows !
yes , and if nothing had been done that ought not to have been done , I , old as I am , would have challenged him - that f@@ op !
yes , now go and dose her , and call in these qu@@ acks ! '
the Prince appeared to have much more to say , but as soon as the Princess heard his tone she , as always happened in serious cases , gave in and became repent@@ ant .
'@@ Alexander , Alexander , ' she whispered , moving nearer and bur@@ sting into tears .
you suffer too , I know .
God is mer@@ ciful ... thank you ... ' he went on , no longer knowing what he was saying , and after responding to his wife 's wet kiss which he felt on his hand , he went out .
when Kit@@ ty , in tears , had left the room , Dol@@ ly , with her mother@@ ly habit of mind , at once saw that here a woman 's task lay before her , and prepared to fulfil it .
she took off her bon@@ net and , having mentally rolled up her sle@@ eves , prepared for action .
while her mother was attacking her father , she tried to restrain the former as far as fil@@ ial respect permitted .
'@@ i wanted to tell you something long ago , M@@ ama . do you know that Levin wished to propose to Kit@@ ty when he was here last ?
but I know it is all because of that ... '
'@@ Yes , and just imagine if she refused Levin - and she would not have refused him if it had not been for that other . I know ...
'@@ Oh ! I can '@@ t make anything out !
nowadays girls all want to trust to their own reason . they don '@@ t tell their mothers anything , and then ...
'@@ M@@ ama , I will go to her . '
am I preventing you ? ' said the mother .
her heart grew chill when she saw Kit@@ ty sitting on the low chair nearest the door , her eyes fixed on a corner of the carpet .
Kit@@ ty glanced at her sister , but the cold and rather severe expression of her face did not change .
'@@ i am going home now and shall have to shut myself up , and you won '@@ t be able to come to me , ' said Dol@@ ly , sitting down beside her sister . ' I want to talk to you . '
'@@ What about ? ' asked Kit@@ ty quickly , lifting her face in alarm .
'@@ i have no troubles . '
do you think I can help knowing ?
and believe me it is so un@@ important ...
Kit@@ ty was silent and her face looked stern .
'@@ He is not worthy of your suffering for him , ' continued Dol@@ ly , going straight to the point .
'@@ no , because he has desp@@ ised me , ' said Kit@@ ty with a shaking voice . ' Don '@@ t speak !
please don '@@ t speak ! '
nobody says so !
I am sure he was in love with you and is still in love , but ... '
'@@ Oh dear ! these commis@@ er@@ ations are what I dre@@ ad most of all ! ' cried Kit@@ ty , suddenly fl@@ aring up .
she turned on her chair , bl@@ ushed , and began rapidly moving her fingers , pressing now with one hand and now with the other the buck@@ le of a belt she was holding .
and it is my sister who says that to me . my sister who imag@@ ines ... that ... that she sympath@@ izes with me ! ...
I don '@@ t want this commis@@ eration and hypocrisy ! '
'@@ Why do you tor@@ ment me ? '
but Kit@@ ty in her excitement did not listen to her .
'@@ There is nothing for me to gri@@ eve for or seek comfort about .
I have enough pride never to let myself love a man who does not love me . '
'@@ But I am not suggesting it ...
the mention of Levin seemed to deprive Kit@@ ty of the last fragments of self @@@ -@@ @ control : she jumped up from her chair , threw the buck@@ le on the floor , and rapidly g@@ es@@ ticul@@ ating with her hands she began :
'@@ What has Levin to do with it ?
I don '@@ t understand why you need tor@@ ment me !
I have said and I repeat I will never , never do what you are doing - returning to a man who has betrayed you and has loved another woman .
I can '@@ t understand it !
you may do it , but I can '@@ t . '
the humiliation of which she was always conscious was peculi@@ arly painful when her sister touched on it .
she had not expected such cruelty from her , and was angry with her .
but suddenly she heard the ru@@ st@@ le of a dress and a burst of suppressed so@@ b@@ bing . a pair of arms en@@ cir@@ cled her neck from below and Kit@@ ty was kne@@ eling before her .
and the sweet tear @@@ -@@ @ stained face hid itself in the fol@@ ds of Dol@@ ly 's dress .
Kit@@ ty did not say a word of this ; she spoke only of her state of mind .
'@@ i have no troubles whatever , ' she said when she had grown calm , - ' but can you understand that everything has become hor@@ rid , disgu@@ sting and coarse to me , and above all I myself ?
you can '@@ t think what hor@@ rid thoughts I have about everything . '
'@@ But what hor@@ rid thoughts can you have ? ' asked Dol@@ ly smiling .
'@@ the very nas@@ ti@@ est and co@@ ar@@ s@@ est , I can '@@ t tell you .
it is as if all that was good in me had hidden itself , and only what is hor@@ rid remains .
how am I to tell you ? ' - she continued , noticing perpl@@ ex@@ ity in her sister 's eyes : - ' Pap@@ a began to speak to me just now ... It seems to me that he thinks that all I need is to get married .
M@@ ama takes me to a ball : and it seems to me she only takes me there to marry me off as quickly as possible and get rid of me .
I know it is not true , but I can '@@ t get rid of the idea .
I always think they are taking my measure .
formerly to go anywhere in a ball @@@ -@@ @ dress was just a pleasure to me . I used to like myself in it ; but now I feel ashamed and uncomfortable .
'@@ Well , you see , everything appears to me in the co@@ ar@@ s@@ est and most hor@@ rid aspect , ' she continued . ' that is my illness .
perhaps it will pass ... '
I only feel comfortable with children , only in your house . '
'@@ What a pity you can '@@ t come to see us ! '
and Kit@@ ty insisted on having her own way , went to her sister 's , and nur@@ sed the children all through the scar@@ let fever that really attacked them .
the two sisters nur@@ sed all the six children successfully through the illness , but Kit@@ ty 's health did not improve , and in L@@ ent the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys went abroad .
the highest PE@@ TER@@ SB@@ UR@@ G SO@@ C@@ IE@@ TY IS RE@@ AL@@ LY ALL ONE : all who belong to it know and even visit one another .
but this large circle has its subdivisions .
Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna K@@ aren@@ ina had friends and close connections in three different sets .
one of these was her husband 's official set , consisting of his colleagues and subordin@@ ates , who in most varied and cap@@ r@@ icious ways were connected and separated by social conditions .
Anna found it hard now to recall the feeling of almost religious respect she had at first felt for these people .
another circle with which Anna was intimate was that through which K@@ aren@@ in had made his career .
the centre of that circle was the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna .
it consisted of elderly , plain , philanthrop@@ ic and pious women and clever , well @@@ -@@ @ educated , ambitious men .
one of the clever men who belonged to it called it , ' the conscience of Petersburg Society . '
K@@ aren@@ in set great value on this circle , and Anna , who knew how to get on with every one , had during the first part of her life in Petersburg made friends in it too .
but now , on her return from Moscow , that circle became un@@ bearable to her .
it seemed to her that she , and all of them , were only pretending , and she felt so bored and uncomfortable in that Society that she visited Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna as rarely as possible .
'@@ When I am old and ugly I will become like that , ' Bet@@ sy used to say , ' but for you , a young and beautiful woman , it is too early to settle down in that al@@ ms @@@ -@@ @ house . '
she avoided her moral friends and went into grand Society .
there she saw V@@ ron@@ sky , and experienced a trem@@ ulous joy when meeting him .
she met him most frequently at Bet@@ sy 's , who was a V@@ ron@@ sky herself and his cousin .
V@@ ron@@ sky went everywhere where he had a chance of meeting Anna , and spoke to her of his love whenever he could .
she was aware that when they met joy lit up her eyes and drew her lips into a smile , but she could not hide the expression of that joy .
a famous pri@@ ma don@@ na was giving her second performance and all high Society was at the Opera House .
V@@ ron@@ sky , from the front row of the st@@ alls , seeing his cousin , went to her box without waiting for the interval .
V@@ ron@@ sky looked at her inqu@@ ir@@ ingly .
she nodded , and he thanked her by a smile and sat down beside her .
'@@ And how well I remember your ri@@ dic@@ ule ! ' continued the Princess Bet@@ sy , who took particular pleasure in following the progress of this passion . ' what has become of it all ?
you are caught , my dear fellow ! '
he knew very well that he ran no risk of appearing ridiculous either in Bet@@ sy 's eyes or in the eyes of Society people generally .
'@@ And why did you not come to dinner ? ' she said admir@@ ingly .
'@@ i must tell you about that .
I 'll give you a hundred or a thousand gu@@ esses - and you won '@@ t find out !
'@@ You must tell me all about it , ' she said , rising . ' come back in the next interval . '
'@@ What ? from N@@ il@@ sson ? ' asked Bet@@ sy , quite horri@@ fied , though she could not have distinguished N@@ il@@ sson 's voice from that of a chorus girl .
'@@ It can '@@ t be helped , I have an appointment there in connection with this same peac@@ emaking of mine . '
'@@ - " Bless@@ ed are the peac@@ em@@ akers , for they will be saved ! " - ' said Bet@@ sy , remembering that she had heard some one say something like that . ' well , then , sit down and tell me about it . '
and she sat down again .
'@@ IT 'S R@@ AT@@ H@@ ER improper but so charming that I long to tell it , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , gaz@@ ing at her with laughing eyes . ' I Sh@@ an '@@ t mention names . '
'@@ So much the better . I shall guess them . '
'@@ Well then , listen : two gay young fellows were out driving ... '
'@@ Offic@@ ers of your regiment , of course ? '
'@@ i did@@ n '@@ t say officers , but just two young men who had been lun@@ ching ... '
'@@ It may be .
they were on their way to dine with a com@@ rade , and in the highest spirits .
they see that a pretty woman in a hired sle@@ dge is passing them , looking at them , and laughing and nod@@ ding to them - at any rate they think so .
of course off they go after her , gal@@ lo@@ ping full speed .
to their surprise the lovely one stops at the door of the very house they are going to .
she runs up to the top flat .
they only manage to see a pair of red lips beneath a short veil , and lovely little feet ... '
'@@ You tell it with so much feeling that I think you yourself must have been one of the two . '
'@@ And what did you say to me just now ?
well , the young men go into their com@@ rade 's flat . he was giving a farewell dinner .
there they may really have drunk rather too much , as always happens at farewell dinners .
at dinner they inqu@@ ire who lives in the top flat .
no one knows ; but their host 's foot@@ man , in answer to their question whether " girls " lived there , replies that there are a lot of them there@@ abouts .
'@@ Why do you tell me such horrors ?
a maid opens the door ; they give her the letter and assure her that they are both so much in love that they will die at once on the door@@ step .
suddenly a gentleman with sa@@ usage @@@ -@@ @ shaped whis@@ kers , and as red as a lob@@ ster , appears , announces that no one but his wife lives in that flat and turns them both out ... '
'@@ How do you know he had " sa@@ usage @@@ -@@ @ shaped whis@@ kers , " as you say ? '
'@@ You just listen !
the tit@@ ular Coun@@ cill@@ or lo@@ dges a complaint , and I turn into a peac@@ emaker - and what a peac@@ emaker ! ...
I assure you Tal@@ ley@@ r@@ and was nothing to me ! '
'@@ What was the difficulty ? '
'@@ You shall hear .
we duly apologi@@ zed : " we are in despair ; we beg to be forgiven for our unfortunate mistake . "
the tit@@ ular Coun@@ cill@@ or with his s@@ aus@@ ages begins to th@@ aw , but also wishes to express his feelings , and as soon as he begins to express them he begins to get excited and grows insul@@ ting , and again I have to set all my diplomatic talents in motion .
" I agree that they acted badly , but beg you to consider that it was a mistake ; consider their youth ; besides which the young men had just d@@ ined .
they repent from the bottom of their hearts , and ask you to forgive their fault . "
Petr@@ itsky ; whom V@@ ron@@ sky was fond of , was mixed up in the affair , and so was young Prince K@@ ed@@ rov , a first @@@ -@@ @ rate fellow and a capital com@@ rade , who had lately joined the regiment .
above all , the interests of the regiment were involved .
both officers belonged to V@@ ron@@ sky 's squ@@ adron .
tit@@ ular Coun@@ cill@@ or W@@ end@@ en had been to see the Commander and had lodged a complaint against the officers who had insul@@ ted his wife .
these officers , in their sle@@ dge , rac@@ ed after her ; she became frightened , and feeling still more un@@ well ran up the stairs to her flat .
W@@ end@@ en himself , having returned from his office and hearing the front @@@ -@@ @ door bell and voices , went out , saw the ti@@ p@@ sy officers with the letter , and hu@@ st@@ led them out .
'@@ no , say what you like , ' the Commander remarked to V@@ ron@@ sky , whom he had invited to his house , ' Petr@@ itsky is becoming impossible .
V@@ ron@@ sky realized how un@@ grateful a task it was - that a du@@ el was out of the question , and that everything must be done to soften the tit@@ ular Coun@@ cill@@ or and h@@ ush up the affair .
the C.@@ O. had called V@@ ron@@ sky in just because he knew him to be hon@@ our@@ able and able , and above all a man who valued the honour of the regiment .
after discussing the matter , they decided that V@@ ron@@ sky should go with Petr@@ itsky and K@@ ed@@ rov to apologize to the Coun@@ cill@@ or .
having reached the French Theatre , V@@ ron@@ sky went out into the fo@@ yer with the C.@@ O. , and informed him of his success or lack of success .
'a bad business , but most am@@ using !
K@@ ed@@ rov C@@ AN@@ NOT fight that good man !
wonderful ! ' he went on , referring to the new French actress . ' however often one sees her , she is new each day .
only the French can do that ! '
Princess Bet@@ sy W@@ ENT HO@@ ME without waiting for the end of the last act .
the conversation in both circles , as always happens at first , hes@@ itated for a few minutes , was interrupted by greetings , recogn@@ itions , and offers of tea , and seemed to be seeking something to settle on .
'@@ She is wonder@@ fully good as an actress , one sees that she has studied K@@ aul@@ bach , ' remarked an att@@ ach@@ é in the circle round the ambassador 's wife . ' did you notice how she fell ... '
this was the Princess My@@ ag@@ k@@ aya , notorious for her simplicity and the rough@@ ness of her manners , and nick@@ named l '@@ en@@ f@@ ant terrible .
the conversation was broken by this remark , and it became necessary to find another topic .
'@@ People say that is very difficult , and that only what is malicious is am@@ using , ' he began with a smile .
once one has a theme , it is easy to embroi@@ der on it .
I often think that the famous tal@@ kers of the last century would find it difficult to talk cl@@ ever@@ ly nowadays .
'@@ That was said long ago , ' interrupted the ambassador 's wife , laugh@@ ingly .
the conversation had begun very pret@@ tily , but just because it was too pretty it langu@@ ished again .
they had to return to the one sure and never @@@ -@@ @ failing resource - slan@@ der .
'@@ Don '@@ t you think there is something Louis Qu@@ in@@ ze about T@@ ush@@ kevich ? ' said the att@@ ach@@ é , gl@@ ancing at a handsome , fair @@@ -@@ @ haired young man who stood by the tea @@@ -@@ @ table .
he matches the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room ; that is why he comes here so often ! '
this conversation did not flag , since it hin@@ ted at what could not be spoken of in this room , namely , at the relations existing between T@@ ush@@ kevich and their host@@ ess .
'@@ Have you heard ? that that Mal@@ ty@@ sh@@ ch@@ eva woman also - not the daughter but the mother - is having a di@@ able rose costume made for herself ? '
'@@ i wonder that she , with her common sense - for she is not stupid - does not see how ridiculous she makes herself . '
every one had something dispar@@ aging to say about the unfortunate Mal@@ ty@@ sh@@ ch@@ eva , and the conversation began crack@@ ling mer@@ r@@ ily like a kind@@ ling bon@@ fire .
stepping silently on the thick carpet , he approached the Princess My@@ ag@@ k@@ aya .
'@@ How did you like N@@ il@@ sson ? ' he inqui@@ red .
'@@ Oh , how can you steal on one like that ?
how you frightened me ! ' said she in reply . ' please don '@@ t talk to me about the opera - you know nothing of music .
I had better descend to your level and talk about your maj@@ ol@@ ica and eng@@ rav@@ ings .
I have learnt from those - what is their name ? - the bankers ... They have some splendid eng@@ rav@@ ings .
'@@ What ? have you been to the Sch@@ uz@@ bur@@ gs ? ' asked the host@@ ess from her place by the sam@@ ov@@ ar .
we had to invite them , and I gave them a sauce that cost eighty @@@ -@@ @ five kop@@ eks , and satisfied every one .
'@@ Won@@ der@@ ful ! ' said some one else .
in the Society in which she lived words of that kind produced the effect of a most wit@@ ty joke .
the Princess My@@ ag@@ k@@ aya did not understand why her words had such an effect , but was aware that they did and avail@@ ed herself of it .
'@@ Will you really not have a cup of tea ?
'@@ no , we are very comfortable here , ' replied the ambassador 's wife smiling , and she continued the interrupted conversation .
it was a very pleasant conversation .
they were dispar@@ aging the K@@ aren@@ ins , husband and wife .
'@@ Anna has changed very much since her trip to Moscow .
there is something strange about her , ' said a friend of Anna 's .
'@@ the chief change is that she has brought back with her the shadow of Alex@@ is V@@ ron@@ sky , ' said the ambassador 's wife .
Gri@@ mm has a f@@ able called " The Man Without a Shadow " - about a man who lost his shadow as a punishment for something or other .
I never could understand why it was a punishment !
'@@ Yes , but a woman with a shadow generally ends badly , ' said Anna 's friend .
'a mur@@ rain on your tongue ! ' suddenly remarked the Princess My@@ ag@@ k@@ aya , hearing these words . ' Anna K@@ aren@@ ina is a splendid woman .
'@@ Why don '@@ t you like her husband ?
he is such a remarkable man , ' said the ambassador 's wife . ' my husband says there are few statesmen like him in Europe . '
'@@ My husband tells me the same , but I don '@@ t believe it , ' replied the Princess My@@ ag@@ k@@ aya . ' if our husbands did@@ n '@@ t talk , we should see things as they really are ; and it 's my opinion that K@@ aren@@ in is simply stupid .
I say it in a whis@@ per !
'@@ Not at all .
I have no choice .
one of us is stupid , and you know it 's impossible to say so of oneself . '
'@@ no one is satisfied with his position , but every one is satisfied with his w@@ it , ' remarked the att@@ ach@@ é , qu@@ oting some French lines .
'@@ That 's it , that 's just it , ' re@@ joined the Princess My@@ ag@@ k@@ aya , turning quickly toward him . ' but the point is , that I won '@@ t abandon Anna to you .
she is so excellent , so charming !
what is she to do , if every one is in love with her and follows her about like a shadow ? '
'@@ But I don '@@ t even think of blaming her ! ' Anna 's friend said , justi@@ fying herself .
'@@ If no one follows us about like a shadow , that does not prove that we have a right to judge her . '
having sn@@ ub@@ bed Anna 's friend hand@@ som@@ ely , the Princess My@@ ag@@ k@@ aya rose with the ambassador 's wife and joined those at the table , where there was a general conversation about the King of Prussia .
'@@ Who@@ m were you back@@ b@@ iting there ? ' asked Bet@@ sy .
'@@ the K@@ aren@@ ins .
the Princess was character@@ izing K@@ aren@@ in , ' replied the ambassador 's wife with a smile , seating herself at the table .
'@@ It 's a pity we did not hear it ! ' said the host@@ ess , gl@@ ancing at the door . ' Ah ! here you are at last ! ' she added , smil@@ ingly addressing V@@ ron@@ sky as he entered the room .
I have been there a hundred times , and always with fresh pleasure .
I know it 's a dis@@ grace , but at the opera I go to sleep , while at the Bou@@ ff@@ e I stay till the last minute enjoying it .
and he named a French actress and was about to tell them something about her when the ambassador 's wife stopped him with mo@@ ck alarm .
'@@ Please don '@@ t talk about those horrors ! '
'@@ all right , I won '@@ t - especially as everybody knows those horrors ! '
'@@ And everybody would go there if it were considered the thing , as the opera is , ' put in the Princess My@@ ag@@ k@@ aya .
steps W@@ ERE HE@@ ARD AT THE EN@@ TRAN@@ CE , and the Princess Bet@@ sy , knowing that it was Anna , glanced at V@@ ron@@ sky .
he was looking at the door with a strange new expression on his face .
he bowed low and moved a chair toward her .
but immediately , nod@@ ding rapidly to her acquaintances and pressing the hands extended to her , she turned again to her host@@ ess :
'@@ i have just been at the Countess Ly@@ dia 's .
'@@ Oh , that missionary ? '
I have seen him .
'@@ Yes ; they say it 's quite settled . '
'@@ i am surprised at her parents .
they say it 's a love match . '
what ant@@ ed@@ il@@ u@@ vian ideas you have !
who talks of love nowadays ? ' said the ambassador 's wife .
'@@ What 's to be done ?
that silly old fashion h@@ as@@ n '@@ t died out yet ! ' said V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ So much the worse for those who follow the fashion !
'@@ Yes , but how often the happiness of marriages founded on reason crum@@ bles to dust because the very passion that was dis@@ regarded makes itself felt later , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ Then some one should invent a way of in@@ oc@@ ulating love , like vaccination . '
'@@ When I was young I was in love with a ch@@ or@@ ister , ' said Princess My@@ ag@@ k@@ aya . ' I don '@@ t know whether it did me any good . '
'@@ no , jo@@ king apart , I believe that to understand love one must first make a mistake and then correct it , ' said the Princess Bet@@ sy .
'@@ It is never too late to m@@ end ! ' said the att@@ ach@@ é , qu@@ oting the English prover@@ b .
'@@ Ex@@ ac@@ tly ! ' chim@@ ed in Bet@@ sy . ' one has to make mistakes and correct them .
what do you think ? ' she asked , addressing Anna , who with a scarcely discer@@ ni@@ ble resolute smile was listening to this conversation .
V@@ ron@@ sky had gaz@@ ed at Anna and with sinking heart waited to hear what she would say .
he sigh@@ ed , as after a danger averted , when she had uttered these words .
'@@ i have received a letter from Moscow .
they write that Kit@@ ty Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ skaya is very ill . '
'@@ Re@@ ally ? ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , fro@@ w@@ ning .
'@@ It does not interest you ? '
what exactly do they write , if I may ask ? ' he inqui@@ red .
'@@ Gi@@ ve me a cup of tea , ' she said , stopping behind Bet@@ sy 's chair .
while Bet@@ sy was pouring out the tea , V@@ ron@@ sky went up to Anna .
'@@ What do they write ? ' he asked again .
'@@ i don '@@ t quite understand your meaning , ' he said , handing her the cup .
'@@ i wanted to tell you , ' she began again , without looking at him , ' that you have behaved badly , very badly . '
'@@ Don '@@ t I know that I behaved badly ?
but who was the cause ? '
'@@ Why say that to me ? ' she asked , looking severely at him .
'@@ You know why , ' he answered boldly and joy@@ ously , meeting her look and continuing to gaze at her .
'@@ That only proves you have no heart , ' she said .
but her look said that she knew he had a heart and that she therefore feared him .
'@@ What you have just referred to was a mistake , and not love . '
I have come to tell you that this must stop !
I have never till now had to bl@@ ush before anyone , but you make me feel as if I were guilty of something . '
he looked at her , and was struck by the new , spiritual beauty of her face .
'@@ What do you want of me ? ' he asked , simply and seriously .
'@@ You don '@@ t want that , ' he replied .
he saw that she was saying what she forced herself to utter and not what she wished to say .
'@@ If you love me as you say you do , ' she whispered , ' behave so that I may be at peace . '
'@@ Don '@@ t you know that you are all my life to me ? ... But peace I do not know , and can '@@ t give to you .
my whole being , my love ... yes !
I C@@ AN@@ NOT think about you and about myself separately .
you and I are one to me .
and I do not see before us the possibility of peace either for me or for you .
I see the possibility of despair , mis@@ fortune ... or of happiness - what happiness ! ...
she exerted all the powers of her mind to say what she ought ; but instead she fixed on him her eyes filled with love and did not answer at all .
'@@ This is it ! ' he thought with rap@@ ture . ' just as I was beginning to despair , and when it seemed as though the end would never come ... here it is !
she acknowledges it ! '
'@@ Do this for me : never say such words to me , and let us be good friends . ' these were her words , but her eyes said something very different .
'@@ Friends we shall not be , you know that yourself ; but whether we shall be the hap@@ pi@@ est or the most miserable of human beings ... rests with you . '
she wished to say something , but he interrupted her .
'@@ i ask only one thing : I ask the right to hope and suffer as I do now ; but if even that is impossible , command me to disappear , and I will do it .
you shall not see me if my presence is painful to you . '
'@@ i don '@@ t want to drive you away . '
'@@ Only don '@@ t change anything .
leave everything as it is ! ' he said with trembling voice . ' here is your husband . '
indeed , just at that moment K@@ aren@@ in , with his deliberate , un@@ graceful g@@ ait , entered the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room .
'@@ Your Hotel R@@ amb@@ ou@@ il@@ let is in full mu@@ ster , ' said he , gl@@ ancing round the whole company , ' the gr@@ aces and the M@@ uses . '
but the Princess Bet@@ sy could not bear that tone of his : ' sne@@ ering , ' she called it in English : so , like a clever host@@ ess , she at once led him into a serious conversation on universal military service .
K@@ aren@@ in was immediately absorbed in the conversation , and began defending the new law very ear@@ ne@@ stly against the Princess Bet@@ sy , who attacked it .
V@@ ron@@ sky and Anna remained sitting at the little table .
'@@ This is becoming in@@ decent ! ' whispered a lady , indicating by a glance V@@ ron@@ sky , Anna , and Anna 's husband .
'@@ What did I tell you ? ' replied Anna 's friend .
not these two ladies alone , but nearly all those present in the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room , even the Princess My@@ ag@@ k@@ aya and Bet@@ sy herself , several times glanced across at the pair who had gone away from the general circle , as if their having done so disturbed the others .
only K@@ aren@@ in did not once glance that way and was not distracted from the interesting conversation in which he was engaged .
'@@ i am always amazed at your husband 's clear@@ ness and ex@@ acti@@ tude of expression , ' she said . ' the most transcend@@ ental ideas become accessible to me when he speaks . '
'@@ Oh yes ! ' said Anna , radiant with a smile of happiness and not understanding a single word of what Bet@@ sy was saying ; and going across to the big table she joined in the general conversation .
after half an hour 's stay K@@ aren@@ in went up to his wife and suggested that they should go home together ; but , without looking at him , she answered that she would stay to sup@@ per .
K@@ aren@@ in bowed to the company and went away .
the foot@@ man stood holding open the carriage door .
she gave him her hand , and with her quick elastic step went past the hall @@@ -@@ @ porter and vanished into the carriage .
he kis@@ sed the palm of his hand where she had touched it , and went home happy in the knowledge that in this one evening he had made more progress toward his aim than he had during the previous two months .
at the usual hour he rose and prepared for bed .
Anna had not yet returned .
with the book under his arm he went up@@ stairs ; but to @@@ -@@ @ night , instead of his usual thoughts and calculations about his official affairs , his mind was full of his wife and of something unpleasant that had happened concerning her .
contrary to his habit he did not go to bed , but with his hands cl@@ as@@ ped behind his back started pac@@ ing up and down the rooms .
he felt that he could not lie down , till he had thought over these newly @@@ -@@ @ arisen circumstances .
he was not of a jeal@@ ous disposition .
jealousy in his opinion insul@@ ted a wife , and a man should have confidence in his wife .
he had lived and worked all his days in official spheres , which deal with reflections of life , and every time he had knocked up against life itself he had stepped out of its way .
he now experienced a sensation such as a man might feel who , while quietly crossing a bridge over an abyss , suddenly sees that the bridge is being taken to pieces and that he is facing the abyss .
the abyss was real life ; the bridge was the artificial life K@@ aren@@ in had been living .
it was the first time that the possibility of his wife 's falling in love with anybody had occurred to him , and he was horri@@ fied .
through her room he reached the door of their bedroom and then turned back again .
'@@ But express what ? what decision ? ' he asked himself in the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room , and could find no answer .
'@@ But after all , ' he reflected before turning into her room , ' what is it that has happened ?
what of that ?
are there not plenty of men with whom a woman may talk ?
his mind as well as his body performed a complete circle each time without arriving at anything new .
he began thinking about her : of what she thought and felt .
that was the abyss into which he feared to look .
to put himself in thought and feeling into another being was a mental action foreign to K@@ aren@@ in .
he considered such mental acts to be inj@@ ur@@ ious and dangerous roman@@ cing .
but what is to be done ?
I am not one of those who suffer anxiety and agitation and have not the courage to look them in the face ! '
'@@ i must think it over , come to a decision , and throw it off , ' he said aloud .
'@@ Well then , ' thought he , ' the question of her feelings and so on are questions for her conscience , which C@@ AN@@ NOT concern me .
my duty is clearly defined .
as head of the family I am the person whose duty it is to guide her , and who is therefore partly responsible ; I must show her the danger which I see , warn her , and even use my authority .
I must speak plainly to her . '
what he would say to his wife took clear shape in K@@ aren@@ in 's head .
and inter@@ lac@@ ing his fingers , pal@@ ms down@@ wards , he stretched them and the joints cracked .
that movement - a bad habit of cracking his fingers - always tranqu@@ illi@@ zed him and brought him back to that precision of mind which he now so needed .
K@@ aren@@ in , ready to deliver his speech , stood pressing his inter@@ lac@@ ed fingers together , trying whether some of them would not crack again .
by the sound of her light step on the st@@ air he was aware of her approach and , though he was satisfied with his speech , he felt some apprehen@@ sion of the coming explanations .
Anna walked IN WITH bowed HE@@ AD , playing with the t@@ as@@ sels of her hood .
her face shone with a vivid glow , but it was not a joy@@ ous glow - it resem@@ bled the terrible glow of a confl@@ agr@@ ation on a dark night .
on seeing her husband she lifted her head and , as if aw@@ aking from sleep , smiled .
'@@ You 're not in bed ?
what a wonder ! ' she said , throwing off her hood , and without pa@@ using she went on to her dressing @@@ -@@ @ room . ' Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich , it 's high time ! ' she added from beyond the door .
'@@ Anna , I must have a talk with you . '
'@@ With me ? ' she said with surprise , coming back from the other room and looking at him . ' what is it ?
what about ? ' she asked , seating herself . ' well , let us have a talk , if it is so important .
Anna said what came into her head , and hearing her own words was astonished at her capacity for deception .
how simple and natural her words sounded and how really it seemed as if she were merely sleep@@ y !
she felt herself clo@@ thed in an im@@ penetr@@ able arm@@ our of lies and that some unseen power was helping and supporting her .
'@@ Anna , I must warn you , ' said he .
'@@ War@@ n me ? ' she asked , ' what about ? '
she looked so naturally and g@@ aily at him , that one who did not know her as her husband did could not have noticed anything strange either in the int@@ on@@ ation or the meaning of her words .
he saw that the depths of her soul , till now always open , were closed to him .
more than that , he knew from her tone that she was not ashamed of this , but seemed to be saying frankly : ' yes , it is closed , and so it should be and will be in future . '
he now felt like a man who on coming home finds his house locked against him .
'@@ But perhaps the key can still be found , ' thought K@@ aren@@ in .
'@@ i wish to warn you , ' he said in low tones , ' that you may , by in@@ discretion and ca@@ rel@@ essness , give the world occasion to talk about you .
your too animated conversation to @@@ -@@ @ night with Count V@@ ron@@ sky ' ( he pronounced the name firmly and with quiet deliber@@ ation ) ' attracted attention . '
as he spoke he looked at her laughing eyes , terrible to him now in their im@@ penetr@@ ability , and felt the us@@ elessness and id@@ l@@ eness of his words .
I was not dull .
does that offend you ? '
K@@ aren@@ in started and bent his hands to crack his fingers .
'@@ Oh , please don '@@ t crack your fingers ! I dislike it so ! ' she said .
'@@ Anna , is this you ? ' said he softly , making an effort and ref@@ ra@@ ining from moving his hands .
'@@ But whatever is the matter ? ' she asked in a tone of com@@ ical surprise and sincerity . ' what do you want of me ? '
K@@ aren@@ in paused and rub@@ bed his forehead and eyes .
'@@ This is what I intended to say , ' he continued col@@ dly and calmly , ' and I ask you to listen to me .
as you know , I consider jealousy an insul@@ ting and degrading feeling and will never allow myself to be guided by it ; but there are certain laws of propri@@ ety which one C@@ AN@@ NOT disregard with impunity .
I did not notice it this evening , but , judging by the impression created , all present noticed that you behaved and acted not quite as was desirable . '
'@@ Well , I 'm listening ! what next ? ' said she quietly and mock@@ ingly . ' I am even listening with interest because I should like to understand what it is all about . '
as she spoke she wondered at her quietly natural tone and at her correct choice of words .
your feelings concern your own conscience , but it is my duty to you , to myself , and to God , to point out to you your duties .
this bond can only be broken by a crime , and that kind of crime brings its punishment . '
'@@ i don '@@ t understand anything ...
Oh dear ! and as ill @@@ -@@ @ luck will have it , I am dread@@ fully sleep@@ y ! ' said she , while with de@@ ft fingers she felt for the remaining pins in her hair .
'@@ Anna , for God 's sake don '@@ t talk like that ! ' he said mildly . ' perhaps I am mistaken , but believe me that what I am saying I say equally for my own sake and for yours .
for an instant her head had dro@@ op@@ ed and the mo@@ cking spark in her eyes had died away , but the word ' love ' aroused her again .
'@@ Love ! ' she thought , ' as if he can love !
if he had never heard people talk of love , he would never have wanted that word .
he does not know what love is . '
'@@ Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich , I really do not understand , ' she replied . ' explain what you consider ... '
'@@ Allow me to finish .
I love you .
but I am not talking of myself . the chief persons concerned are our son and yourself .
I repeat - perhaps my words may seem quite super@@ flu@@ ous to you ; perhaps they result from a mistake of mine .
in that case I ask your pardon !
but if you feel that there are any grounds , however slight , I beg you to reflect , and if your heart prompts you to tell me ... '
K@@ aren@@ in did not notice that he was saying something quite different from what he had prepared .
'@@ i have nothing to say .
besides ... ' she added , rapidly , and hardly re@@ pressing a smile , ' it really is bed@@ time . '
K@@ aren@@ in sigh@@ ed , and without saying anything more went into the bedroom .
when she went there he was already in bed .
his lips were ster@@ nly compressed and his eyes did not look at her .
Anna got into her bed , and every moment expected that he would address her .
she was afraid of what he would say , and yet wished to hear it .
but he remained silent .
she was thinking of another ; she saw him , and felt her heart fill with excitement and guilty joy at the thought .
suddenly she heard an even , quiet , nas@@ al sound like whist@@ ling .
for a moment the sound he emitted seemed to have star@@ tled K@@ aren@@ in , and he stopped ; but , after he had breath@@ ed twice , the whist@@ ling recomm@@ enced with fresh and calm regularity .
'@@ It 's late , it 's late , ' she whispered to herself , and smiled .
for a long time she lay still with wide @@@ -@@ @ open eyes , the brightness of which it seemed to her she could herself see in the darkness .
from THAT T@@ IME a new life began for K@@ aren@@ in and his wife .
nothing particular happened .
Anna went into Society as before , frequently visiting the Princess Bet@@ sy , and she met V@@ ron@@ sky everywhere .
K@@ aren@@ in noticed this , but could do nothing .
she met all his efforts to bring about an explanation by presenting an im@@ penetr@@ able wall of mer@@ ry perpl@@ ex@@ ity .
externally things seemed as before , but their intimate relations with one another were completely changed .
K@@ aren@@ in , strong as he was in his official activities , felt himself powerless here . like an ox he waited sub@@ mis@@ sively with bowed head for the pole @@@ -@@ @ ax@@ e which he felt was raised above him .
pale , with trembling lower jaw , he stood over her , entre@@ ating her to be calm , himself not knowing why or how .
'@@ Anna , Anna , ' he said in trembling voice , ' Anna , for God 's sake ! ... '
'@@ My God !
forgive me ! ' she said , so@@ b@@ bing and pressing V@@ ron@@ sky 's hand to her breast .
looking at him , she felt her degradation physically , and could say nothing more .
he felt what a murderer must feel when looking at the body he has deprived of life .
the body he had deprived of life was their love , the first period of their love .
there was something fri@@ ghtful and revol@@ ting in the recoll@@ ection of what had been paid for with this terrible price of shame .
the shame she felt at her spiritual n@@ ak@@ edness communicated itself to him .
but in spite of the murderer 's horror of the body of his victim , that body must be cut in pieces and hidden away , and he must make use of what he has obtained by the murder .
then , as the murderer desperately throws himself on the body , as though with passion , and dr@@ ags it and h@@ acks it , so V@@ ron@@ sky covered her face and shoulders with kis@@ ses .
she held his hand and did not move . yes !
these kis@@ ses were what had been bought by their shame !
'@@ Yes , and this hand , which will always be mine , is the hand of my accompl@@ ice . '
he kn@@ elt down and tried to see her face , but she hid it and did not speak .
at last , as though mastering herself , she sat up and pushed him away .
her face was as beautiful as ever , but all the more pit@@ eous .
'@@ i C@@ AN@@ NOT help remembering what is life itself to me !
'@@ What bliss ? ' she said with dis@@ gust and horror , and the horror was involun@@ tarily communicated to him . ' for heaven 's sake , not another word ! '
she rose quickly and moved away from him . ' not another word ! ' she repeated , and with a look of cold despair , strange to him , she left him .
she felt that at that moment she could not express in words her feeling of shame , joy , and horror at this entrance on a new life , and she did not wish to vul@@ gar@@ ize that feeling by inadequate words .
she said to herself : ' no , I can '@@ t think about it now ; later , when I am cal@@ mer . '
'@@ Not now ; later , when I am cal@@ mer ! ' she said to herself .
but in her dreams , when she had no control over her thoughts , her position appeared to her in all its shocking n@@ ak@@ edness .
one dream she had almost every night .
she dream@@ t that both at once were her husbands , and lav@@ ished their ca@@ resses on her .
Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich we@@ pt , kis@@ sing her hands , saying : ' how beautiful it is now ! ' and Alex@@ is V@@ ron@@ sky was there too , and he also was her husband .
and she was surprised that formerly this had seemed impossible to her , and laugh@@ ingly explained to them how much simpler it really was , and that they were both now cont@@ ented and happy .
but this dream weighed on her like a nightmare , and she woke from it filled with horror .
now that years have passed , when I remember it , I am surprised that it could have griev@@ ed me so much .
so it will be with this grief .
time will pass , and I shall become indifferent . '
but three months passed and he had not become indifferent to it , and to think of it still hurt him as it had done in the first days .
he could not find peace , because he had so long dreamed of family life and felt so ripe for it , but was still un@@ married and further than ever from marriage .
he himself felt painfully what all those around him felt too , that it is not good for a man of his age to be alone .
but now he was further from marriage than ever .
the place was uno@@ c@@ cu@@ pied , and when in imagination he tried to put one of the girls he knew there , he felt that it was quite impossible .
moreover , the memory of her refusal , and the part he had played in it , tor@@ m@@ ented him with shame .
however much he told himself that he was not at all to blame in that matter , the memory of it , together with other shameful memories , made him start and bl@@ ush .
these wounds never closed up .
and among these recoll@@ ections stood the memory of her refusal and the p@@ iti@@ ful role he must have played in the eyes of the others that evening .
the painful memories became more and more covered over by the commonplace but important events of country life .
every week he thought less and less about Kit@@ ty .
he waited impati@@ ently to hear that she was married or was getting married soon , hoping that such news , like the drawing of an aching tooth , would quite cure him .
meanwhile spring had come , a glorious steady spring , without the expectations and dis@@ appointments spring usually brings . it was one of these rare springs which plants , animals , and men alike rejoice in .
this lovely spring r@@ oused Levin still more and confirmed him in the determination completely to renounce the past in order to fashion his solitary life firmly and independently .
he was so successful in persuading his brother , and in lending him money for the journey without irrit@@ ating him , that he was satisfied with himself in this respect .
the spring had set in late .
it th@@ aw@@ ed in the sunshine by day , but at night the ther@@ mom@@ eter went down to sixteen degrees F@@ ah@@ ren@@ he@@ it . the snow was covered with a cr@@ ust of ice so thick that car@@ ts could pass even where there were no roads .
Easter found snow still on the ground ; but on Easter Monday a warm wind began to blow , the clouds gathered , and for three days and nights warm stor@@ my rain poured down .
on the Thursday the wind fell and a thick grey mist rose as if to hide the secret of the changes nature was carrying on .
in the morning the bright rising sun quickly melted the thin ice on the water and the warm air all around vibr@@ ated with the vap@@ our given off by the awakening earth .
the cows had been let out there , and , war@@ med by the sunshine , their glossy new coats g@@ listening , they were lowing to be let out into the fields .
the co@@ wher@@ d ran away mer@@ r@@ ily to get ready .
he sent for the carp@@ enter , who was under contract to be with the thresh@@ ing @@@ -@@ @ machine , but it turned out that he was men@@ ding the har@@ rows , which should have been men@@ ded the week before L@@ ent .
this was very annoying to Levin .
it was v@@ exing that the ca@@ reless farm management , against which he had struggled so many years with all his might , still continued .
he found out that the racks which were not wanted in winter had been taken into the farm @@@ -@@ @ horses ' stable , and there had got broken , as they were lightly made , being meant only for the cal@@ ves .
Levin sent for the ste@@ ward , but instead of waiting went at once to look for him himself .
the ste@@ ward , in his Astrakhan @@@ -@@ @ trim@@ med coat , as radiant as everything else that day , was coming from the thresh@@ ing @@@ -@@ @ ground breaking a bit of straw in his hands .
'@@ Oh , I meant to tell you yesterday that the har@@ rows need men@@ ding .
what is one to do with such people ! ' said the ste@@ ward , wav@@ ing his arm .
'@@ It 's not a case of such people , but of such a ste@@ ward ! ' said Levin fl@@ aring up .
'@@ And the clo@@ ver ? '
'@@ i have sent Vasily , he and M@@ ish@@ ka are sowing .
'@@ How many acres ? '
'@@ Why not the lot ? ' shouted Levin .
that they were only sowing sixteen instead of fifty acres with clo@@ ver was still more annoying .
to grow clo@@ ver successfully it was necessary according to both theory and his own experience to sow it as early as possible , almost before the snow had finished melting , and Levin could never get this done .
what are you to do with such people ?
'@@ Well then , you should have let the straw wait . '
'@@ Five are making com@@ po@@ te ' ( he meant comp@@ ost ) ' and four are turning the o@@ ats over . they might begin sp@@ routing , Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich . '
Levin understood very well that ' might begin sp@@ routing ' meant that the English seed @@@ -@@ @ o@@ ats were already spo@@ iling . here again his orders had not been obeyed .
'@@ Oh dear , did@@ n '@@ t I speak about it long ago in L@@ ent ... '
indeed , the day was so beautiful one could not long remain angry .
'@@ Ign@@ at ! ' he called to the co@@ ach@@ man , who with sle@@ eves rolled up was washing a carriage at the pump , ' sadd@@ le me ... '
'@@ Oh , Kol@@ pi@@ k . '
'@@ Car@@ ting man@@ ure must be started early so that it should be over before the first ha@@ y harvest , and the far field will have to be pl@@ ough@@ ed continually so as to keep the earth clean .
the fo@@ rem@@ an listened attentively and evidently tried to approve of his master 's plans : but his face still wore that hopeless and desp@@ ond@@ ent expression so familiar to Levin .
nothing griev@@ ed Levin so much as this manner , but it was a manner common to all the numerous ste@@ wards he had employed .
some came to @@@ -@@ @ day , but they wanted seventy roubles each for the summer . '
that force was opposing him again .
he knew that try as they would they had never managed to get more than from thirty @@@ -@@ @ seven to forty lab@@ our@@ ers at the proper price . forty could be hired , but never more than forty .
yet all the same he could not but continue the struggle .
'@@ Send to S@@ ury and to Che@@ fi@@ rov@@ ka , if they don '@@ t come .
'@@ i 'll send right enough , ' said Vasily Fed@@ or@@ ich , the ste@@ ward , desp@@ ond@@ ently . ' but the horses too are getting weak . '
but don '@@ t I know , ' he added laughing , ' that you always want less of everything and worse ? however , this year I will not let you have your way .
'@@ You don '@@ t sleep much as it is , I think .
'@@ You won '@@ t be able to cross the bro@@ ok , Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich , ' the co@@ ach@@ man called out .
and Levin rode across the mud@@ dy yard and out of the gate into the field at a b@@ risk am@@ ble , his fresh little horse s@@ nor@@ ting at the p@@ ud@@ dles and pulling at the bri@@ dle .
if he had felt light @@@ -@@ @ hearted in the cattle and farm yards , he felt still more so in the fields .
when he had passed the forest , a vast expan@@ se of vel@@ v@@ ety green un@@ rolled before him without a single bare spot , and only sprink@@ led here and there in the hol@@ lows with patches of un@@ melted snow .
dreaming such dreams , carefully guiding his horse so as not to tr@@ ample down his young growth , he rode up to the lab@@ our@@ ers who were sowing the clo@@ ver .
the earth in the cart with which the seeds were mixed was not rub@@ bed fine , but was pressed or frozen into lum@@ ps .
on seeing the master the lab@@ ou@@ rer Vasily moved toward the cart and M@@ ish@@ ka began to sow .
this was not right , but Levin seldom got angry with the hired men .
when Vasily came up Levin told him to take the cart and horse on to the border .
'@@ Yes , sir , ' answered Vasily , and took hold of the horse 's head .
'@@ But the sowing , Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich , is getting on first @@@ -@@ @ rate , ' he said making up to the master .
'@@ Only the walking is dreadful .
'@@ And why has not the earth been si@@ fted ? ' said Levin .
'@@ Oh , but we crum@@ ble it up , ' said Vasily , taking a handful and rubbing the earth between his pal@@ ms .
Vasily was not to blame that they had given him un@@ si@@ fted earth , but still it was annoying .
having more than once successfully tested a patent remedy for conqu@@ ering v@@ ex@@ ation and making all that seemed wrong right again , Levin employed it now .
he looked at the strides M@@ ish@@ ka took dragging the enormous lum@@ ps of earth that stuck to his feet , dis@@ mounted , took the seed @@@ -@@ @ basket from Vasily , and prepared to sow .
'@@ Where did you stop ? '
Vasily pointed to a mark with his foot and Levin began sc@@ attering the seeds and earth as best he could .
it was hard walking , and having done a row Levin , wet with per@@ spir@@ ation , stopped and gave back the basket .
'@@ Mind , sir , and don '@@ t sc@@ old me for this row when summer comes , ' said Vasily .
'@@ Why ? ' said Levin mer@@ r@@ ily , feeling that his remedy was acting well .
you just look where I s@@ owed last spring , how regularly I scattered it over .
I don '@@ t like to do things badly myself and I see that others don '@@ t .
when one looks over there it makes one 's heart rejoice , ' said Vasily , pointing to the field .
I 've been home , and my old father also has s@@ own three measures of wheat .
they say it has caught up the ry@@ e . '
'@@ And have you been sowing wheat long ? '
'@@ Well , mind and rub the lum@@ ps , ' said Levin , going up to his horse , ' and keep an eye on M@@ ish@@ ka , and if the clo@@ ver comes up well you shall have fifty kop@@ eks for each des@@ y@@ at@@ ina . '
we are very grateful to you as it is . '
Levin mounted his horse and rode to the field where clo@@ ver had been s@@ own the year before , and to another which was deeply pl@@ ough@@ ed and ready for sowing the spring wheat .
the clo@@ ver was coming on splen@@ di@@ dly .
it was already reviving and steadily growing green among last year 's wheat stub@@ ble .
it was quite impossible to ride over the deeply @@@ -@@ @ pl@@ ough@@ ed field ; the earth bore only where there was still a little ice , in the th@@ aw@@ ed fur@@ rows the horse 's legs sank in above its past@@ er@@ ns .
everything was beautiful and gay .
'@@ There must be some sni@@ pe too , ' he thought , and just at the turning to his house he met the keeper , who confirmed his sup@@ position .
Levin rode on at a tro@@ t , so as to have dinner and get his gun ready for the evening .
as Levin , IN THE highest SP@@ IR@@ ITS , was nearing the house he heard the sound of a tin@@ k@@ ling bell approaching the main entrance .
who is it ?
can it be brother Nicholas ?
but he was ashamed of that feeling , and immediately , as it were , opened out his spiritual arms and with tender joy expected , and now hoped with his whole soul , that it was his brother .
it was not his brother .
'@@ Oh , if only it 's some nice fellow with whom one can have a talk , ' he thought .
'@@ ah , ' he cried , joy@@ fully lifting both arms , ' here 's a welcome guest !
well , I am glad to see you ! ' he exclaimed , recognizing O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ i shall know now for certain whether she is married or when she will be , ' thought Levin .
and on this lovely day he felt that the memory of her did not hurt him at all .
'@@ It would have been worse still on wheels , Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich , ' said the driver , whom Levin knew .
'@@ Well , I am very , very glad to see you , ' said Levin with a sincere smile , joyful as a child 's .
Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na , always much concerned about the honour of the house , met him in the hall with questions about dinner .
'@@ Do just as you please , only be quick , ' he said and went out to see the ste@@ ward .
when he returned , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , fresh and clean , with hair br@@ ushed , and face radiant with smiles , was just coming out of his room , and they went up@@ stairs together .
now I shall be able to understand what the mysteries you perpetr@@ ate here consist of .
what a house , and everything so splendid , so light , so gay ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , forgetting that it was not always spring and bright weather there , as on that day . ' and your nurse ! quite charming !
a pretty house @@@ -@@ @ maid with a little ap@@ ron would be preferable ; but with your severe and mon@@ astic style this one is more suitable . '
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky had much interesting news to tell , and one item of special interest to Levin was that his brother , Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich , intended to come and stay in the country with him that summer .
not a word did O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky say about Kit@@ ty or about any of the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys ; he only delivered greetings from his wife .
Levin was grateful to him for his del@@ icacy and was very glad of his visit .
'@@ Spl@@ en@@ did , splendid ! ' he said , lighting a thick cigarette after the joint ' I seem to have come to you as one lands from a noisy ste@@ amer on to a peaceful shore .
so you maintain that the lab@@ ou@@ rer should be studied as one of the factors which should decide the choice of agricultural methods ?
you know I am quite an out@@ sider in these matters , but I should think this theory and its application ought to influence the lab@@ ou@@ rer too . '
'@@ Yes , but wait a bit , I am not talking about political economy but about the science of agriculture .
it should resemble the natural sciences and should examine existing phenomena , including the lab@@ ou@@ rer with his economic and ethno@@ graphic ... '
at that moment Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na came in with some jam .
'@@ ah , Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , kis@@ sing the tips of his pl@@ ump fingers ; ' what smoked go@@ ose you have , what her@@ b brandy ! ...
'@@ High time , high time ! Kuz@@ ma , tell them to harness the trap , ' he said , and ran down@@ stairs .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky went down and himself carefully took the canvas cover off the var@@ nished case , opened it , and set to work to put together his valuable gun , which was of the newest type .
Kuz@@ ma , already s@@ cent@@ ing a substantial tip , did not leave O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky for a moment . he put on his stock@@ ings and his boots for him , and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky willingly allowed him to do so .
'@@ are you selling the forest to Ry@@ ab@@ in@@ in ? '
'@@ Yes . do you know him ? '
I have had dealings with him positively and finally . '
'@@ Po@@ si@@ tively and finally ' were the dealer 's favourite words .
'@@ Yes , he does speak very fun@@ n@@ ily .
she knows where the master is going , ' he added , pat@@ ting L@@ aska , who was wh@@ ining and jumping round Levin , now lic@@ king his hand , now his boots and his gun .
the trap was standing at the door when they went out .
'@@ no , let us drive , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , stepping up into the trap . '
he sat down , wrapped a rug round his legs , and lit a ci@@ gar . ' how is it you don '@@ t smoke . ?
a ci@@ gar is such a ... not exactly a pleasure , but the crown and sign of pleasure .
Ah , this is life !
how delightful !
'@@ But who prevents you ? ' Levin remarked , smiling .
'@@ no - you are a lucky fellow !
you have got all you are fond of .
'@@ Per@@ haps it is because I am glad of what I get , and don '@@ t gri@@ eve about what I haven '@@ t , ' said Levin , thinking of Kit@@ ty .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky understood and looked at him but said nothing .
'@@ Well , and how are your affairs ? ' he asked , recoll@@ ecting how wrong it was of him to be thinking only of his own concerns .
I am made that way . and really so little harm is done to anyone , and one gets so much pleasure ... '
'@@ is there anything new then ? ' inqui@@ red Levin .
well , you know Os@@ sian 's type of woman - such as one sees in a dream ?
well , there are such women in reality , and these women are terrible .
woman , you see , is an object of such a kind that study it as much as you will , it is always quite new . '
some mathemati@@ cian has said pleasure lies not in discovering truth but in seeking it . '
Levin listened in silence , but in spite of all his efforts he could not enter into his friend 's soul and understand his feeling , nor the delight of studying women of that kind .
when they had reached the wood Levin got down and led O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky to the corner of a mos@@ sy and marsh@@ y gl@@ ade , already free from snow .
the sun was setting behind the forest , and the little bir@@ ches inter@@ s@@ pers@@ ed among the asp@@ en trees stood out clearly against the evening glow with their dro@@ oping branches and their sw@@ ol@@ len bu@@ ds ready to burst into leaf .
from the th@@ icket , where the snow had not all melted , the water still flowed in bran@@ ching stream@@ lets with a gentle rip@@ pling sound .
'@@ Just fancy !
one can hear and see the grass growing , ' thought Levin , as he noticed a wet s@@ late @@@ -@@ @ coloured asp@@ en leaf move close to the point of a blade of grass .
a haw@@ k flew leis@@ urely past , high above the distant forest ; another followed in the same direction and vanished .
in the th@@ icket the birds ch@@ ir@@ ped louder and louder and more eagerly .
a ta@@ w@@ ny owl hoo@@ ted near by , and L@@ aska started , took a few careful steps , and with her head on one side again listened int@@ ently .
a c@@ uc@@ ko@@ o called beyond the river .
it called twice in its usual note then ho@@ ar@@ sely and hur@@ ri@@ edly and got out of time .
'@@ F@@ ancy a c@@ uc@@ ko@@ o already ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , appearing from behind a bush .
'@@ Yes , I heard , ' answered Levin , so reluctant to disturb the silence of the wood that his own voice sounded unpleasant to him . ' they won '@@ t be long now . '
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's figure again disappeared behind the bush , and Levin only saw the fl@@ are of a match , followed by the red glow of a cigarette and a spiral of blue smoke .
click ! click ! O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky coc@@ ked his gun .
'@@ And what 's that screaming ? ' he asked , drawing Levin 's attention to a long @@@ -@@ @ drawn cry like the high @@@ -@@ @ pit@@ ched wh@@ in@@ ny of a col@@ t in play .
Levin looked to the right and to the left , and there before him against the dull light @@@ -@@ @ blue sky , over the lower branches of the asp@@ en tops , appeared the flying birds .
'a w@@ ret@@ ched miss with the right barrel , ' replied O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , re@@ loading . ' h@@ ush ... coming ! '
indeed , they heard two shr@@ ill whist@@ les quickly following each other .
two sni@@ pe , playing and racing one another , whist@@ ling but not crying , flew almost over the sportsmen 's heads .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky brought down two more birds , and Levin brought down two , of which one was not recovered .
through the young bir@@ ches , Venus bright and sil@@ very , was already shining with her delicate glit@@ ter low down in the west and high up in the east fl@@ ick@@ ered the red fire of the dim Arc@@ tur@@ us .
above his head Levin found , and again lost , stars of the Great Bear .
being in the west Venus would be setting , not rising . ] and all the stars of the Great Bear should be visible .
'@@ is it not time to go ? ' asked O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ as you please . '
they were now standing some fifteen yards apart .
'@@ Stephen ! ' said Levin suddenly and unexpectedly ' why don '@@ t you tell me whether your sister @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law is married , or when she will be ? '
Levin felt so strong and calm that he thought the answer , whatever it might be , could not ag@@ itate him , but he did not at all expect the reply O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky gave him .
'@@ She has not thought , and is not thinking , of getting married , but she is very ill and the doctors have sent her abroad .
'@@ You don '@@ t mean it ! ' exclaimed Levin . ' very ill ?
what 's the matter with her ?
while they were talking L@@ aska , pr@@ icking her ears , kept looking up at the sky and then repro@@ ach@@ fully at them .
'@@ What a time they have chosen to talk , ' thought she . ' and there it comes flying ...
just so , here it is .
they 'll miss it ... '
'@@ Oh ! but there was something unpleasant ! ' he thought . ' yes , of course , Kit@@ ty is ill !
but what can I do ? I am very sorry , ' he thought .
on TH@@ E@@ IR WA@@ Y HO@@ ME Levin inqui@@ red the particul@@ ars of Kit@@ ty 's illness and of the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys ' plans , and though he would have been ashamed to confess it , what he heard was agre@@ eable to him .
it was agre@@ eable because there was still hope for him , and even more because she was suffering , she who had made him suffer so much .
but when O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky began to speak of what caused Kit@@ ty 's illness and to mention V@@ ron@@ sky 's name , Levin interrupted him :
'@@ i have no right whatever to know such family details and frankly I am not interested in them either . '
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky gave a scarcely percep@@ tible smile on noticing the quick change , so familiar to him , in Levin 's face , which became as gloomy as it had been bright a moment before .
'@@ Have you finally settled with Ry@@ ab@@ in@@ in about the forest ? ' asked Levin .
'@@ Yes , I have .
'@@ the fact is you are giving the forest away , ' said Levin m@@ ood@@ ily .
'@@ Why giving away ? ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky with a good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured smile , knowing well that everything would now seem wrong to Levin .
'@@ Because the forest is worth at least five hundred roubles a des@@ y@@ at@@ ina , ' replied Levin .
'@@ Oh , you country gentlemen ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky jo@@ kingly . ' and your tone of contempt for us poor town@@ folk ! ...
but when it comes to getting business done , we do it better than anyone .
believe me , I have reck@@ oned it all out , ' continued he , ' and have sold the forest so well that I am afraid he may change his mind .
you know it 's not timber but , for the most part , only fit for fuel , ' said he , hoping by this remark finally to convince Levin of the injustice of his suspicions .
Levin smiled cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ously .
have you counted the trees ? '
'@@ How can one count the trees ? ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , still anxious to dis@@ pel his friend 's ill @@@ -@@ @ hum@@ our . ' " count grains of sand , " and planets ' rays E '@@ en though a lofty mind were able ... " '
'@@ Well , Ry@@ ab@@ in@@ in 's lofty mind is able to do it .
and no dealer will ever buy without first counting , unless the forest is given to him for nothing , as you are doing .
I know your forest .
I go shooting there every year , and it is worth five hundred roubles a des@@ y@@ at@@ ina cash down and he is paying you two hundred on long term .
'@@ Come , don '@@ t get so carried away , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky pit@@ e@@ ously . ' why did no one offer more ? '
'@@ Because he and the other dealers are in league , and he has bought them off .
I have had dealings with them all , and I know them .
they are not genuine dealers , but shar@@ ks .
he would not consider a deal which would bring him in ten or fifteen per cent ; he waits till he can buy at a fifth of the value . '
'@@ Not at all , ' said Levin glo@@ om@@ ily , just as they drove up to the house .
Ry@@ ab@@ in@@ in himself was already in the house and met the two friends in the hall .
he was a tall , spare , middle @@@ -@@ @ aged man , with a mou@@ st@@ ache , a prominent sha@@ ven chin , and prominent dim eyes .
he wore a long @@@ -@@ @ skir@@ ted blue coat with buttons very low down at the back , high boots drawn quite straight over the cal@@ ves of his legs and cr@@ ink@@ led round the ank@@ les , and over them he had on a pair of large gol@@ os@@ hes .
he wiped his face all round with his hand@@ ker@@ chief , and smoo@@ thing his coat , which was already quite in order , smil@@ ingly greeted the new arri@@ vals . he held out his hand to O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky as if he were trying to catch something .
'@@ Oh , so you have come , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky taking his hand . ' that 's right ! '
'@@ i dared not dis@@ obey your Excell@@ ency 's commands , though the roads are quite too bad .
'@@ Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich , my respects to you ! ' he said turning to Levin and trying to catch his hand too .
'@@ W@@ ould you like to go into my study ? ' said Levin , fro@@ w@@ ning m@@ ood@@ ily , and addressing O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky in French . ' go into the study , you can talk things over there . '
on entering the study Ry@@ ab@@ in@@ in looked round by force of habit as though to find the icon , but after finding it he did not cross himself .
he glanced at the book cu@@ p@@ boards and book @@@ -@@ @ shelves with the same look of doubt as he had bestowed on the sni@@ pe , smiled cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ously , and again shook his head dis@@ appro@@ v@@ ingly , deci@@ dedly refusing to admit that this game could be worth the candle .
'@@ Well , have you brought the money ? ' asked O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . ' take a seat . '
'@@ There won '@@ t be any difficulty about the money .
'@@ Talk what matters over ?
'@@ i can do that , ' said Ry@@ ab@@ in@@ in , sitting down and putting his arm on the back of his chair in a most uncomfortable way . ' you must let me off something , Prince .
Levin , who had been putting away his gun in a cu@@ pboard , was just going out of the door , but on hearing the dealer 's words he stopped .
Ry@@ ab@@ in@@ in rose and smiled silently , surve@@ ying Levin from his feet to his head .
'@@ He is very close , is Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich , ' he said , addressing O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky with a smile . ' it 's absolutely impossible to buy anything of him .
'@@ Why should I give you what is mine for nothing ?
I have not found it on the ground nor stolen it . '
'@@ Oh dear no , nowadays it is quite impossible to steal .
absolutely everything nowadays goes before a jury , everything is judged hon@@ our@@ ably , there 's no possibility of stealing .
we speak honestly .
if you have , there 's no use bargaining , but if not , ' said Levin , ' I will buy the forest myself . '
the smile vanished from Ry@@ ab@@ in@@ in 's face , which assumed a haw@@ k @@@ -@@ @ like , rap@@ acious , and cruel expression .
'@@ If you please , the forest is mine , ' he said , rapidly crossing himself and holding out his hand . ' take your money , the forest is mine .
that 's the way Ry@@ ab@@ in@@ in does business , no fus@@ sing about kop@@ eks , ' he said , fro@@ w@@ ning and flourishing his pocket @@@ -@@ @ book .
'@@ If I were you I should not be in a hurry to take it , ' remarked Levin .
'@@ What d '@@ you mean ? ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky with surprise . ' why , I 've given my word . '
Levin went out and s@@ lam@@ med the door .
Ry@@ ab@@ in@@ in looked at it and smiled , shaking his head .
'@@ That 's all his you@@ th@@ fulness , his absolute chil@@ dis@@ hness .
why , I am making this purchase , believe me , just for the honour and glory of the thing , so that it should be Ry@@ ab@@ in@@ in and not another that has bought O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's forest .
an hour later the dealer ; with his coat well lap@@ ped over , the hoo@@ ks of his over@@ coat carefully fast@@ ened , and with the agreement in his pocket , seated himself in his little cart and drove home .
" that 's so , " responded the cler@@ k , handing him the re@@ ins and but@@ t@@ oning the leather ap@@ ron . " but I can congratulate you on the purchase , Mi@@ hail Ign@@ ati@@ t@@ ch ? "
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky W@@ ENT up@@ stairs , his pockets bul@@ ging with the treasury @@@ -@@ @ bills payable in three months ' time with which Ry@@ ab@@ in@@ in had paid him .
he wanted to finish the day at sup@@ per as pleas@@ antly as he had begun it .
Levin really was in a bad hum@@ our , and in spite of his desire to behave kindly and am@@ i@@ ably to his charming guest he could not master himself .
the intox@@ ication of the news that Kit@@ ty was not married was beginning little by little to take effect on him .
Kit@@ ty was un@@ married and ill , and ill for love of the man who had sligh@@ ted her .
V@@ ron@@ sky had sligh@@ ted her and she had sligh@@ ted him , Levin .
consequently V@@ ron@@ sky had a right to desp@@ ise him and was therefore his enemy .
but Levin did not think all this .
he dim@@ ly felt that there was something insul@@ ting to him in the affair , and was angry not with what had upset him but with everything that presented itself to him .
the stupid sale of the forest , the sw@@ ind@@ le O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky had fallen a prey to , which had been perpetr@@ ated in his house , irrit@@ ated him .
'@@ Well , have you finished ? ' he said when he met O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky up@@ stairs . ' will you have some sup@@ per ? '
'@@ i won '@@ t say no .
what an appetite I get in the country , wonderful !
why did you not offer Ry@@ ab@@ in@@ in something to eat ? '
'@@ Well , really , how you treat him ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . ' you did not even give him your hand .
why not shake hands with him ? '
'@@ Because I do not shake hands with the foot@@ man , and the foot@@ man is a hundred times better than he . '
'@@ What a reactionary you really are !
what about merging the classes ? ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ i see you are quite a reactionary . '
I am Constan@@ tine Levin , that 's all . '
'@@ And Constan@@ tine Levin is in a very bad tem@@ per , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , smiling .
'@@ Yes , I am in a bad tem@@ per , and do you know why ?
because , excuse me , of your stupid sale . '
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky wrink@@ led his face good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ure@@ dly , like an innocent man who was being hurt and interfer@@ ed with .
'@@ Oh don '@@ t ! ' he said . ' when has a man ever sold anything without being told immediately after that it was worth much more ?
no , I see you have a gr@@ udge against that unfortunate Ry@@ ab@@ in@@ in . '
and impoverished not from extravag@@ ance . that would not matter so much : to spend like a no@@ bl@@ eman is their business - only the no@@ bl@@ esse know how to do it .
at present the peasants around here are buying land - that does not pain me .
the squ@@ ire does nothing , the peasant works and sque@@ ez@@ es out the id@@ ler .
but it hurts me to see this impover@@ ishment as a result of , - shall I call it simplicity ?
here a Polish le@@ as@@ e@@ holder buys for half its value the splendid estate of a lady who lives in Nice .
there land that is worth ten roubles a des@@ y@@ at@@ ina is leased to a merchant for one rouble .
'@@ Cer@@ tain@@ ly count them !
Ry@@ ab@@ in@@ in 's children will have the means to live and get an education , while yours may not have ! '
'@@ Well , forgive me , but there is something petty in all this counting .
we have our occupation and they have theirs , and they have to make a profit .
and here come the fried eggs , just the way I like them best .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky sat down to table and began jo@@ king with Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na , assuring her that it was long since he had had such a dinner and sup@@ per as that day .
'@@ Well , you appreciate it at least , ' said Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na ; ' but Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich , whatever one gives him , if it were only a cr@@ ust of bread , would just eat it and go away . '
try as Levin would to control himself , he remained mor@@ ose and silent .
there was one question he wanted to put to O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , but could not bring himself to ask , nor could he find the form to put it in or the moment to ask it .
'@@ Yes , by the by , where is V@@ ron@@ sky now ? ' he asked , suddenly putting down the soap .
'@@ V@@ ron@@ sky ? ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , c@@ easing to y@@ awn . ' he is in Petersburg .
he left soon after you did , and has not been in Moscow once since then .
but , as I told you then , I do not know who had the better chance .
I told you at the time that ... ' He y@@ aw@@ ned , but only with his jaw , without opening his mouth .
the insult of the refusal he had had to face burned in his heart like a fresh , newly @@@ -@@ @ received wound .
but he was at home and the walls of home are helpful .
'@@ W@@ ait , wait , ' he began , interrup@@ ting O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . ' you talk of his being an arist@@ ocr@@ at .
but I should like to ask you what is V@@ ron@@ sky 's or anyone else 's arist@@ ocracy that I should be sligh@@ ted because of it ?
you consider V@@ ron@@ sky an arist@@ ocr@@ at . I don '@@ t .
a man whose father craw@@ led up from nothing by intri@@ gues and whose mother has had relations with heaven knows whom ...
I agree with you , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky sincerely and cheer@@ fully , though he felt that Levin ranked him with those who could be bought for silver .
Levin 's ve@@ hem@@ ence sincerely pleased him . ' whom are you driving at ?
though much of what you say is not true of V@@ ron@@ sky , I am not speaking about that .
I want to tell you candi@@ dly that if I were you , I 'd came to Moscow now with me , and ... '
'@@ Why ?
'@@ But don '@@ t let us talk about it !
forgive me , please , if I have been ru@@ de to you , ' said Levin .
now that he had spoken out he became once more as he had been in the morning . ' you are not angry with me , Steve ?
please don '@@ t be angry , ' he said smiling , and took his hand .
'@@ Oh no , not at all ! there was nothing to be angry about .
I am glad we have had this explanation .
should we not go ?
though V@@ ron@@ sky 'S WH@@ OLE IN@@ NE@@ R LIF@@ E W@@ AS absorbed by his passion , his external life ran un@@ alter@@ ably and inevitably along its former customary rails of social and regim@@ ental connections and interests .
the interests of the regiment occupied an important place in his life , because he was fond of his regiment and still more because the regiment was fond of him .
V@@ ron@@ sky was aware of this attitude of his comrades toward him , and besides liking the life felt bound to justify their view of him .
they already prepared lum@@ ps of mud to pel@@ t her with in due time .
most of the older people and of those highly @@@ -@@ @ placed regre@@ tted this impending social scandal .
she had not seen him since his sudden departure from Moscow , and through her el@@ dest son she sent him word to come and see her .
the elder brother was also dissatisfied with the younger .
besides his military and social interests V@@ ron@@ sky had another one , namely horses , of which he was passi@@ on@@ ately fond .
on the contrary he needed an occupation and an interest apart from his love , in which to refresh himself and find rest from the impressions which ag@@ itated him too violently .
on THE DA@@ Y OF THE Krasno@@ e Sel@@ o RA@@ CES V@@ ron@@ sky came earlier than usual to the regim@@ ental mess @@@ -@@ @ room to eat his be@@ ef@@ ste@@ ak .
he sat waiting with his el@@ b@@ ows on the table and his coat un@@ but@@ t@@ oned over a white wai@@ st@@ coat , and while waiting for the be@@ ef@@ ste@@ ak he had ordered he looked at the pages of a French novel that lay on his plate .
he thought of Anna , who had promised to meet him after the races .
but he had not seen her for three days and , as her husband had returned from abroad , he did not know whether she could keep the appointment to @@@ -@@ @ day or not , and he did not know how to find out .
he had seen her last at his cousin Bet@@ sy 's country house .
he went to the K@@ aren@@ ins ' country house * as seldom as possible , but now he meant to go there and was considering how to do it .
'@@ of course I can say that Bet@@ sy sent me to find out if she will be at the race .
yes , of course I will go , ' he decided , lifting his eyes from the book , and a vivid sense of the joy of seeing her made his face radiant .
'@@ Send to my house and tell them to harness three horses to the cal@@ è@@ che at once , ' he said to the wa@@ iter who had brought him a be@@ ef@@ ste@@ ak on a hot silver plate ; and drawing the plate nearer to him he began to eat .
V@@ ron@@ sky glanced at them , fro@@ w@@ ned , and , as if he had not noticed them , turned his eyes on his book and began to eat and read at the same time .
'@@ What ? forti@@ fying yourself for your job ? ' asked the pl@@ ump officer taking a seat beside him .
'@@ as you see , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , fro@@ w@@ ning and wi@@ ping his mouth , without looking at the speaker .
'@@ Not afraid of getting fat ? ' said the other , turning a chair round for the young officer .
'@@ What ? ' said V@@ ron@@ sky fro@@ w@@ ning , making a gri@@ m@@ ace of dis@@ gust and showing his regular teeth .
'@@ Not afraid of getting fat ? '
'@@ Wa@@ iter , sh@@ er@@ ry ! ' said V@@ ron@@ sky without repl@@ ying , and moving his book to the other side of his plate he continued to read .
the pl@@ ump officer took the wine @@@ -@@ @ list and turned to the young one . ' you choose what we shall drink , ' said he , handing him the list and looking at him .
'@@ Sup@@ pose we have some Rhine wine , ' said the young one , turning his eyes tim@@ idly to V@@ ron@@ sky while his fingers tried to catch hold of his just @@@ -@@ @ bud@@ ding mou@@ st@@ ache .
seeing that V@@ ron@@ sky did not turn round , he rose .
'@@ Let us go into the billi@@ ard @@@ -@@ @ room , ' he said .
the pl@@ ump officer got up obedi@@ ently and they made their way toward the door .
at that moment Captain Y@@ ash@@ vin , a tall man with a fine figure , entered the room , and having given a cont@@ emp@@ tuous backward nod to the two officers he came up to V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ ah , here he is ! ' he exclaimed , and with his big hand gave V@@ ron@@ sky a sharp sla@@ p on his shoulder @@@ -@@ @ str@@ ap .
V@@ ron@@ sky looked up an@@ gr@@ ily , but his face bri@@ ghtened at once into its characteristic look of quiet , firm kind@@ liness .
'@@ That is wise , Alex@@ is , ' said the captain in a loud bar@@ it@@ one , ' eat now , and drink one small glass . '
'@@ i don '@@ t want to eat . '
'@@ There are the insepar@@ ables , ' added Y@@ ash@@ vin , gl@@ ancing ironically at the two officers who were just going out of the room .
'@@ Why did you not come to the Kras@@ n@@ ensky Theatre last night ? '
'@@ i stayed late at the T@@ ver@@ sko@@ ys . '
Y@@ ash@@ vin , a gam@@ bler , a r@@ ake , a man not merely without principles but with bad principles , was V@@ ron@@ sky 's best friend in the regiment .
V@@ ron@@ sky respected and liked Y@@ ash@@ vin , particularly because he felt that the latter liked him , not for his name and money but for himself .
he felt that Y@@ ash@@ vin , though apparently desp@@ ising all emotion , was the only one who could understand the power of the passion that now filled his whole life .
V@@ ron@@ sky did not talk to him of his love , but was aware that he knew all about it and understood it rightly , and it was pleasant to him to read this in Y@@ ash@@ vin 's eyes .
'@@ ah , yes ! ' he said when he heard that V@@ ron@@ sky had been at the T@@ ver@@ sko@@ ys ; his black eyes spark@@ led and he began twist@@ ing his left mou@@ st@@ ache round into his mouth - a bad habit he had .
'@@ Well , and what were you doing last night ?
'@@ E@@ ight thousand .
'@@ Well , then , you can afford to lose on me , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , laughing .
( Y@@ ash@@ vin had st@@ aked heavily on V@@ ron@@ sky . )
the conversation turned to the forecast of the day 's race , the only subject V@@ ron@@ sky could now think about .
'@@ Let us go . I have finished , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , and he rose and moved toward the door .
Y@@ ash@@ vin rose also and stretched his great legs and long back .
here in camp also , Petr@@ itsky lived with him .
Petr@@ itsky was asleep when V@@ ron@@ sky and Y@@ ash@@ vin entered .
'@@ Get up , you 've slept enough ! ' said Y@@ ash@@ vin , stepping behind the partition and shaking by the shoulder the dish@@ ev@@ elled Petr@@ itsky , who lay with his nose buried in the pillow .
Petr@@ itsky suddenly sprang to his knees and looked round .
'@@ V@@ od@@ ka is better than anything , ' said Y@@ ash@@ vin in his base voice . ' Ter@@ esh@@ chenko ! vodka and pick@@ led c@@ uc@@ um@@ bers for your master ! ' he shouted , evidently enjoying the sound of his own voice .
'@@ V@@ od@@ ka , you think , eh ? ' asked Petr@@ itsky , making a face and rubbing his eyes .
'@@ And will you have a drink ?
'@@ To the st@@ ables , and then I have to go to Bry@@ ansky about the horses , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky .
he had really promised to go to Bry@@ ansky 's , who lived seven miles from Pet@@ er@@ hof , and pay him for the horses , and he hoped to make time to call there too .
but his friends understood at once that it was not only there that he was going .
Petr@@ itsky , still singing , win@@ ked his eyes and p@@ ou@@ ted as if to say , ' We know what sort of Bry@@ ansky it is . '
'@@ Mind and don '@@ t be late ! ' was all Y@@ ash@@ vin said , and to change the subject he asked , ' Is my Ro@@ an doing well ? ' looking out of the window at the middle horse , which he had sold to V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ W@@ ait ! ' shouted Petr@@ itsky to V@@ ron@@ sky , who was already going out . ' your brother left a letter for you and a note . wait ! where are they ? '
that is the question ! ' decla@@ im@@ ed Petr@@ itsky with solem@@ nity , moving his finger upwards from his nose .
'@@ Come , tell me . this is stupid ! ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , smiling .
'@@ En@@ ough of this !
where is the letter ? '
'@@ no , really I have forgotten .
why get angry ?
if you had emp@@ tied four bottles a head as we did last night , you would not know where you were lying .
Petr@@ itsky went behind the partition and lay down on his bed .
so I lay , and so he stood .
here it is ! ' and Petr@@ itsky drew the letter from under the matt@@ ress where he had put it .
V@@ ron@@ sky took the letter and his brother 's note .
it was just what he had expected : a letter from his mother repro@@ aching him for not having come to see her , and a note from his brother saying that they must talk things over .
V@@ ron@@ sky knew that it all referred to the same subject .
'@@ What business is it of theirs ? ' thought he , and crum@@ pling up the letters he pushed them in between the buttons of his coat , to be read more attentively on the way .
in the passage he met two officers , one of his own and one of another regiment .
V@@ ron@@ sky 's quarters were always the ha@@ unt of all the officers .
'@@ i have to go to Pet@@ er@@ hof . '
'@@ Has the mare come from Ts@@ ar@@ skoe ? '
but how will you manage to ride through such mud ? ' said the other officer .
'@@ These are the things to restore me ! ' shouted Petr@@ itsky on seeing the new @@@ -@@ @ com@@ ers . the orderly stood before him with vodka and pick@@ led c@@ uc@@ um@@ bers on a tray . ' Y@@ ash@@ vin here has ordered vodka to fresh@@ en me up . '
'@@ Well , you did give it us last night , ' said one of the new @@@ -@@ @ com@@ ers . ' you did not let us sleep all night . '
'@@ Oh , but how we finished up ! ' said Petr@@ itsky . ' Vol@@ kov climbed out on to the roof and said he felt mel@@ anch@@ ol@@ y .
'@@ Now that is reasonable !
'@@ no , good @@@ -@@ @ bye , gentlemen . I am not drinking to @@@ -@@ @ day . '
'@@ Why , because of the weight ?
well then , we will drink by ourselves .
let 's have sel@@ t@@ zers and lem@@ ons . '
'@@ V@@ ron@@ sky ! ' shouted some one as V@@ ron@@ sky was already leaving .
'@@ You should have your hair cut ; it will be too heavy , especially on the top . '
he laughed mer@@ r@@ ily , showing his compact row of teeth , and drawing his cap over the bal@@ d patch , went out and got into the cal@@ è@@ che .
'@@ To the st@@ ables ! ' he said , and was taking out the letter to read , but then changed his mind , not wishing to be upset before examining his horse . ' later will do ! ... '
the temporary ST@@ ABLE , a wooden structure , had been built close to the rac@@ ec@@ our@@ se , and it was there his mare was to have been brought the day before .
during these last days he had not exercised her himself , but had entrusted it to the trainer , and therefore did not in the least know in what condition she had arrived or now was .
hardly had he stepped out of the cal@@ è@@ che before his g@@ room , who had recognized it from a distance , had called out the trainer .
a lean Englis@@ hman in top boots and a short jacket , with only a tu@@ ft of beard left under his chin , came to meet him with the awkward g@@ ait of a j@@ ockey , sw@@ aying from side to side with his el@@ b@@ ows sticking out .
'@@ Well , how is Fro@@ u @@@ -@@ @ Fro@@ u ? ' asked V@@ ron@@ sky in English .
'@@ no , I 'll go in .
'@@ Come along , ' said the Englis@@ hman fro@@ w@@ ning and speaking as before without opening his mouth . sw@@ aying his el@@ b@@ ows and walking with his loose g@@ ait he led the way .
a smart , well @@@ -@@ @ dressed l@@ ad in a short and clean jacket , with a b@@ room in his hand , met them and followed them .
in the shed five horses stood in the horse @@@ -@@ @ boxes , and V@@ ron@@ sky knew that his principal rival , Mak@@ ho@@ tin 's sixteen @@@ -@@ @ hand ch@@ est@@ nut , G@@ lad@@ i@@ ator , was to have been brought that day and should be standing there too .
as he went along the passage the l@@ ad opened the second horse @@@ -@@ @ box to the left , and V@@ ron@@ sky caught sight of a big ch@@ est@@ nut horse with white legs .
he knew it was G@@ lad@@ i@@ ator , but like one who avoids seeing another 's open letter , he turned and went to Fro@@ u @@@ -@@ @ Fro@@ u 's box .
MA@@ K ... I never can pron@@ ounce his name , ' said the Englis@@ hman over his shoulder , pointing with his black @@@ -@@ @ n@@ ailed thumb to G@@ lad@@ i@@ ator 's box .
yes , that is my only serious rival , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ If you were riding him , I would back you , ' said the Englis@@ hman .
'@@ Fro@@ u @@@ -@@ @ Fro@@ u is the bra@@ ver , but the other is the more powerful horse , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , smiling at the complim@@ ent to his riding :
'@@ are you quite sure that more training was unnecessary ? '
the mare is nervous , ' he added , nod@@ ding toward the closed horse@@ box before which they were standing , and from which was heard the tram@@ pling of hoo@@ fs among the straw .
he opened the door , and V@@ ron@@ sky entered the box , which was dim@@ ly lit by one small window .
in the box stood a mu@@ zz@@ led dark @@@ -@@ @ bay mare stepping from foot to foot among the fresh litter .
Fro@@ u @@@ -@@ @ Fro@@ u was of medium size and by no means free from bl@@ emish .
she was sl@@ en@@ derly built . her chest , though well arch@@ ed , was narrow .
her hind@@ quarters tap@@ ered rather too much , and her legs , especially her h@@ ind legs , were percep@@ ti@@ bly bowed in@@ wards .
neither fore nor h@@ ind legs were particularly muscular , but on the other hand she was extremely broad in the gir@@ th , now that she was lean from her strict training .
seen from the front , her can@@ on bones were very fine and sharp , but unusually wide seen side@@ ways .
she appeared all the more narrow in build because so deep in the breadth .
but she possessed in the highest degree a characteristic which made one forget all her defects . this was her thorough@@ bred quality - the kind of blood that tells , as they say in English .
the muscles , clearly marked beneath the network of sin@@ ews , stretched in the fine , mobile skin , which was smooth as s@@ atin , seemed hard as bone .
her lean head with the prominent , bright , sparkling eyes , broad@@ ened out to her mu@@ zzle with its wide cri@@ m@@ son no@@ str@@ ils .
her whole appearance , more especially about the head , was spir@@ ited yet gentle .
she was one of those creatures who seem as if they would certainly speak if only the mechanical construction of their mouths allowed them to .
to V@@ ron@@ sky at any rate it seemed that she understood all he was feeling while looking at her .
'@@ Oh , you dar@@ ling ! ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , stepping toward the horse and soo@@ thing her .
but the nearer he came the more nervous she grew .
only when he reached to her head did she suddenly calm down , and the muscles under her fine , delicate coat vibr@@ ated .
V@@ ron@@ sky stro@@ ked her firm neck , adjusted a lock of her man@@ e that had got on to the wrong side of her sharply @@@ -@@ @ defined with@@ ers and brought his face close to her dil@@ ated no@@ str@@ ils , delicate as a bat 's wing .
her extended no@@ str@@ ils loudly inhal@@ ed and ex@@ hal@@ ed her breath , and she set back one of her fin@@ ely @@@ -@@ @ pointed ears with a start , and stretched out her black firm lips toward V@@ ron@@ sky , as if wishing to catch hold of his sleeve .
but remembering her mu@@ zzle she gave it a jer@@ k , and again began stepping from one of her fin@@ ely ch@@ is@@ elled feet to the other .
'@@ Be quiet , dar@@ ling , be quiet ! ' he said , again stro@@ king her fl@@ ank , and left the box with a joyful conviction that the horse was in the very best condition .
the mare 's excitement had communicated itself to V@@ ron@@ sky . he felt that the blood was rushing to his heart , and that he , like the horse , wished to move and to bite ; it was both frightening and joyful .
'@@ Well then , I rely on you , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky to the Englis@@ hman . ' you will be on the spot at half @@@ -@@ @ past six . '
'@@ all right , ' said the Englis@@ hman . ' and where are you going , my lord ? ' he asked unexpectedly , addressing him as ' my lord , ' which he hardly ever did .
V@@ ron@@ sky raised his head in amaz@@ ement and looked as he knew how to , not into the Englis@@ hman 's eyes but at his forehead , surprised at the bold@@ ness of the question .
'@@ How often have I been asked that question to @@@ -@@ @ day ? ' he thought , and bl@@ ushed , a thing he rarely did .
the Englis@@ hman looked at him attentively and , as if he knew where he was going , added :
'@@ the chief thing before a race is to keep cool : Don '@@ t be put out or upset . '
'@@ all right , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky smiling , and jumping into the cal@@ è@@ che , he told the co@@ ach@@ man to drive to Pet@@ er@@ hof .
he had not gone many yards before the clouds , which had been threatening since morning , broke , and there was a down@@ pour of rain .
'@@ This is bad ! ' thought V@@ ron@@ sky , raising the hood of the cal@@ è@@ che . ' it was mud@@ dy before , but now it will be a sw@@ amp . '
sitting alone in the closed chal@@ ice he drew out his mother 's letter and his brother 's note and read them through .
yes , it was the same thing over and over again .
they all , his mother and his brother and everybody , considered it necessary to interfere with his intimate affairs .
this interference r@@ oused him to anger , a feeling he rarely experienced .
why does everybody consider it his duty to look after me ?
if it were an ordinary empty Society intri@@ gue they would let me alone .
they feel that it is something different , that it is not a game , and that this woman is de@@ arer to me than life .
that is incomprehensible , and therefore it v@@ exes them .
they have no conception of what happiness is , and they do not know that without love there is no happiness or un@@ happiness for us , for there would be no life , ' he thought .
he was angry with everybody for their interference , just because he felt in his soul that they were right .
he felt that the love that united him with Anna was not mom@@ entary inf@@ at@@ uation , which would pass , as Society intri@@ gues do , without leaving any trace in the lives of the one or the other except pleasant or dis@@ agre@@ eable memories .
and he experienced a strange feeling which since his union with Anna sometimes over@@ came him .
it was a feeling of re@@ vul@@ sion against something , against K@@ aren@@ in , or against himself or against the whole world - he hardly knew which .
but he always drove away this strange feeling .
'@@ Yes , formerly she was unhappy , but proud and calm ; but now she C@@ AN@@ NOT be calm and dignified , though she still seems so .
yes , this must be brought to an end , ' he decided .
and for the first time the clear idea occurred to him that it was necessary to put an end to all this false@@ hood , and the sooner the better .
'@@ Th@@ row up everything and let us two conceal ourselves somewhere alone with our love , ' said he to himself .
hoping to find her alone , V@@ ron@@ sky , as usual , to attract less attention , ali@@ ghted before crossing the little bridge that led to the house and walked on .
he did not go straight to the entrance from the street but passed through the yard .
'@@ Has your master returned ? ' he asked a gar@@ den@@ er .
go in at the front door ; the servants are there and will open it , ' replied the man .
V@@ ron@@ sky had now forgotten all his thoughts on the way , about the hard@@ ness and difficulty of his situation .
he only thought that he would see her immediately , not merely in fancy , but alive , all of her - as she was in reality .
that boy was a more frequent hind@@ r@@ ance to their relations than anyone else .
they had not arranged this , but it had come about of itself .
they would have considered it un@@ worthy of themselves to deceive that child .
in his presence they talked as acquaintances .
it was as if the child felt that between that man and his mother there was some important relation which he could not understand .
and the boy really felt that he could not understand this relation . he tried but could not make out what he ought to feel toward this man .
'@@ What does it mean ?
who is he ?
how should I love him ?
the presence of that child always aroused in V@@ ron@@ sky that strange feeling of un@@ reasoning re@@ vul@@ sion which had of late come to him .
this child with his naive outlook on life was the compass which showed them their degree of divergence from what they knew , but would not recognize , as the right course .
this time Ser@@ ez@@ ha was not at home , and Anna was quite alone , sitting on the ver@@ and@@ ah waiting for the return of her son , who had gone for a walk and had been caught in the rain .
she had sent a man and a mai@@ d@@ servant to look for him and sat waiting .
she wore a white dress trim@@ med with wide embroi@@ dery , and as she sat in a corner of the ver@@ and@@ ah behind some plants , did not hear V@@ ron@@ sky coming .
b@@ owing her cur@@ ly head she pressed her forehead against a cold wat@@ ering @@@ -@@ @ can that stood on the bal@@ u@@ str@@ ade , and both her beautiful hands , with the rings he knew so well , were holding the can .
the beauty of her whole figure , her head , her neck , and her arms , always struck V@@ ron@@ sky with new surprise .
he stopped , gaz@@ ing at her with rap@@ ture .
but just as he was going to step toward her , she felt his near@@ ness , pushed away the can , and turned her hot face toward him .
are@@ n '@@ t you well ? ' he said in French as he came up to her .
he wished to run toward her , but remembering that there might be others near , turned to look at the ver@@ and@@ ah door and bl@@ ushed , as he always did when he felt that he had reason to fear and to be circum@@ spect .
'@@ no , I am quite well , ' she said , rising and firmly pressing his out@@ stretched hand . ' I did not expect you . '
'@@ Oh , heavens ! what cold hands ! ' he said .
'@@ You frightened me , ' she said . ' I am alone and was expecting Ser@@ ez@@ ha . he went for a walk ; they will return this way . '
but though she tried to be calm her lips trem@@ bled .
'@@ Why " forgive " ?
'@@ But you are ill or in trouble , ' he continued without releasing her hand , but bending over it . ' what were you thinking about ? '
'@@ Always about the same thing , ' she said with a smile .
whenever , - at whatever moment , - she was asked what she was thinking about she could have answered without fail , ' Always about my happiness and my un@@ happiness . '
for certain reasons this thought troubled her more particularly to @@@ -@@ @ day .
V@@ ron@@ sky answered her , and noticing that she was excited , in order to distract her thoughts began giving her in a very matter @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ fact way particul@@ ars of the preparations for the races .
'@@ But you have not told me what you were thinking about when I came in , ' he said , breaking off his narr@@ ation .
she did not answer , but , slightly b@@ owing her head , looked at him from under her brows question@@ ingly , her eyes shining from under their long l@@ ashes .
her hand , to@@ ying with a leaf that she had pulled off , trem@@ bled .
he noticed this , and his face assumed that sub@@ missive , slav@@ ishly @@@ -@@ @ devoted expression that had such an effect on Anna .
'@@ i see that something has happened .
how can I be a moment at peace knowing that you have some sorrow which I am not sharing ?
'@@ i C@@ AN@@ NOT forgive him if he does not understand all the importance of it .
better not tell him , - why put him to the proof ? ' she thought , continuing to look at him in the same way and feeling that her hand with the leaf was trembling more and more .
'@@ Sh@@ all I ? '
the leaf in her hand shook still more violently , but she did not move her eyes from his face , watching to see how he would take it .
he grew pale , tried to say something , but stopped , dropped her hand , and bowed his head .
'@@ Yes , he understands its full significance , ' she thought , and grat@@ efully pressed his hand .
but she was mistaken in thinking that he understood the importance of the news as she , a woman , understood it .
but , besides this , her physical agitation communicated itself to him .
he gave her a look full of emotion , hum@@ bly kis@@ sed her hand , rose , and began silently pac@@ ing up and down the ver@@ and@@ ah .
'@@ Yes , ' he said , resolutely approaching her . ' neither you nor I looked on our union as an amusement , and now our fate is sealed .
we must end ' - he went on , looking round - ' this false@@ hood in which we are living . '
'@@ End it ?
how are we to end it , Alex@@ is ? ' she said softly .
she was quiet now and her face shone with a tender smile .
'@@ They are united already , ' she replied in a scarcely audi@@ ble tone .
'@@ Yes , but entirely . '
'@@ But how , Alex@@ is , teach me how ? ' she said with pathetic irony at the inev@@ itability of her position . ' is there any escape from such a position ?
'@@ There is a way out of every position .
one has to take a decision , ' he said . ' anything would be better than the condition in which you are living .
Don '@@ t I see how suffer from everything - Society , your son , and your husband ? '
'@@ Oh , but not through my husband , ' she said with natural irony . ' I don '@@ t know him and don '@@ t think about him .
'@@ You are not speaking sincerely .
you suffer from him too . '
but to @@@ -@@ @ day he decided to speak out .
'@@ Whe@@ ther he knows or not , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky in his usual firm , calm tone , ' that is not our business . we C@@ AN@@ NOT ...
you C@@ AN@@ NOT remain as you are , especially now . '
'@@ What would you have me do ? ' she asked with the same light irony .
she who had so feared that he might take her pregnancy too lightly now felt v@@ exed that he deduc@@ ed there@@ from the necessity of doing something .
'@@ Tell him everything , leave him . '
'@@ Very well ; suppose I do so ! ' she said . ' do you know what the result will be ?
and he will do what he says , quietly and accurately .
'@@ What then , run away ? '
'@@ And why not run away ?
and not on my account , - I see that you suffer . '
'@@ Yes , run away , and for me to live as your mistress , ' she said mal@@ ici@@ ously .
'@@ Anna , ' he mur@@ mu@@ red with repro@@ ach@@ ful ten@@ derness .
'@@ Yes , ' she continued . ' become your mistress and ruin my ... everything . '
she was again going to say ' son ' but could not utter the word .
'@@ i beg you , I entre@@ at you , ' said she suddenly in quite an altered tone , sincerely and ten@@ derly , taking him by the hand , ' never to speak to me about that ! '
I know all the degradation , all the horror of my position ; but it is not so easy to settle the matter as you think .
leave it to me and listen to me .
never speak to me about it .
'@@ i promise everything , but I C@@ AN@@ NOT be at peace , especially after what you have told me .
I C@@ AN@@ NOT be at peace when you are not . '
'@@ i ? ' she said . ' yes , I do suffer sometimes ; but it will pass if you never speak to me about it .
it is only when you speak to me about it that I suffer . '
'@@ i don '@@ t understand ... ' said he .
'@@ i know , ' she interrupted him , ' how hard it is for your honest nature to lie and I pity you .
I often think how you have ruined your life because of me . '
'@@ i was just thinking the same , ' he said ; ' wondering how you could sacrifice everything for my sake .
I C@@ AN@@ NOT forgive myself for your un@@ happiness . '
'@@ i unhappy ? ' she said , drawing near to him and gaz@@ ing at him with a smile of rap@@ tur@@ ous love . ' I am like a hungry man to whom food has been given .
he may be cold , his clothes may be r@@ agged , and he may be ashamed , but he is not unhappy .
no , this is my happiness ... '
but she heard the voice of her son approaching , and gl@@ ancing quickly round the ver@@ and@@ ah she rose hur@@ ri@@ edly .
'@@ When ? ' he whispered , gaz@@ ing rap@@ tur@@ ously at her .
'@@ To @@@ -@@ @ night at one , ' she whispered , and with her quick light step went to meet her son .
'@@ Well , au revo@@ ir , ' she said to V@@ ron@@ sky . ' it will soon be time to start for the races .
V@@ ron@@ sky looked at his watch and hur@@ ried away .
when V@@ ron@@ sky looked AT H@@ IS W@@ AT@@ CH on the K@@ aren@@ ins ' ver@@ and@@ ah he was so ag@@ itated and so preoccupied that he saw the hands and face of the watch without realizing the time .
he went to the high road , stepping carefully over the mud , and made his way to his cal@@ è@@ che .
he was so full of his feeling for Anna that he did not consider what o 'clock it was or whether he still had time to call on Bry@@ ansky .
he only retained , as often happens , the external capacity of memory which indicated what he had decided to do next .
only after going some five miles did he recoll@@ ect himself sufficiently to look at his watch and to realize that it was already half @@@ -@@ @ past five , and that he was late .
he could be in time for his own race , but , if he called on Bry@@ ansky first he could only just manage it , and the whole Court would already be at the rac@@ ec@@ our@@ se .
but he had promised Bry@@ ansky to call and therefore he decided to go on , telling the co@@ ach@@ man not to spare the horses .
he saw Bry@@ ansky , stayed with him five minutes , and drove back at a gal@@ lo@@ p .
this quick drive soo@@ thed him .
when he reached his quarters he found no one there - they had all gone to the races and his val@@ et was waiting at the gate .
while he was changing his things , the val@@ et told him that the second race had already begun and that many gentlemen had been to inqu@@ ire for him , and a l@@ ad had run over twice from the st@@ ables .
having changed without hur@@ rying ( he never hur@@ ried or lost his self @@@ -@@ @ control ) , V@@ ron@@ sky ordered the co@@ ach@@ man to drive him to the st@@ ables .
from there he could see the sea of carriages , pedestrians , and soldiers surrounding the rac@@ ec@@ our@@ se , and the stands , which were thr@@ ong@@ ed with people .
probably the second race was just taking place , for as he entered the st@@ ables he heard the bell ring .
on his way he met Mak@@ ho@@ tin 's white @@@ -@@ @ leg@@ ged ch@@ est@@ nut G@@ lad@@ i@@ ator , which in a blue @@@ -@@ @ bor@@ dered orange covering , with his ears looking enormous in their blue @@@ -@@ @ trim@@ med cloth , was being led to the course .
'@@ Where is C@@ ord ? ' he asked the g@@ room .
'@@ in the st@@ ables , sadd@@ ling . '
in her open box Fro@@ u @@@ -@@ @ Fro@@ u stood ready sadd@@ led .
V@@ ron@@ sky once again glanced at the beautiful fascinating shape of the mare , whose whole body was trembling , and tearing himself with difficulty from this sight he left the shed .
he came toward the pav@@ ili@@ ons at the very best time to avoid attracting anyone 's attention .
the g@@ el@@ ding , planting its feet with effort , reduced the speed of its enormous body , and the guards ' officer , like one waking from deep sleep , looked round and forced himself to smile .
V@@ ron@@ sky purpos@@ ely avoided the select and fashionable crowd which moved and chat@@ ted with restrained freedom in front of the pav@@ ili@@ ons .
he as@@ cer@@ tained that Anna , Bet@@ sy , and his brother 's wife were there , but in order not to ag@@ itate himself , intentionally avoided going near them .
but he continually met acquaintances who stopped him , told him about the races that had been run , and asked him why he was so late .
'@@ Did you get my note ? ' he asked . ' one can never find you . '
Alexander V@@ ron@@ sky , despite the loose and , in particular , drun@@ ken life for which he was noted , was quite a cour@@ tier .
'@@ i received it , but really do not understand what you are worrying about , ' replied Alex@@ is .
'@@ i am worrying because people have just remarked to me that you were not here and that you were seen in Pet@@ er@@ hof last Monday . '
'@@ There are things which should be discussed only by those who are directly interested , and the matter you are concerning yourself about is one ... '
'@@ i beg you not to interfere , that is all . '
Alex@@ is V@@ ron@@ sky 's fro@@ w@@ ning face turned pale , and his prominent lower jaw t@@ wit@@ ched , a thing that rarely happened to him .
being a very kind @@@ -@@ @ hearted man he seldom got angry , but when he did , and when his chin t@@ wit@@ ched , then he was dangerous , as Alexander V@@ ron@@ sky knew .
Alexander smiled g@@ aily .
'@@ i only wanted to deliver mother 's letter .
answer her , and don '@@ t upset yourself before the race .
Bon@@ ne chance ! ' he added smiling and went away .
but just then another friendly greeting stopped V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ W@@ on '@@ t you recognize your friends ?
'@@ Come to the mess @@@ -@@ @ room to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , and ap@@ olog@@ e@@ tically pressing the sleeve of O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's over@@ coat , he went to the centre of the rac@@ ec@@ our@@ se where the horses were already being led out for the ste@@ epl@@ ech@@ ase .
to the right the sl@@ ender and beautiful Fro@@ u @@@ -@@ @ Fro@@ u was being led up and down , stepping as on springs with her rather long elastic past@@ er@@ ns .
the large , beautiful , perfectly regular shape of the horse , with his wonderful hind@@ quarters and his exceptionally short past@@ er@@ ns just above his hoo@@ fs , involun@@ tarily arrested V@@ ron@@ sky 's attention .
he wished to go up to his own horse , but was again stopped by an acquaintance .
'@@ ah , there is K@@ aren@@ in ! ' said the acquaintance with whom he was talking . ' he is looking for his wife , and she is in the centre of the pavilion .
'@@ no , I have not , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , and without even gl@@ ancing at the pavilion where Anna was pointed out to him , he went to his horse .
he had not had time to examine the sadd@@ le , about which he wished to give some directions , when the riders were summoned to the pavilion to draw their numbers and places .
with serious , stern , and in many cases pale faces , seventeen officers assembled at the pavilion and drew their numbers .
the order was given : ' Mount ! '
feeling that he and the other riders were the centre toward which all eyes were turned , V@@ ron@@ sky , in the highly @@@ -@@ @ str@@ ung state which generally made his movements calm and deliberate , approached his horse .
cord , in honour of the races , was dressed in his best clothes : a black but@@ t@@ oned @@@ -@@ @ up coat , a stiff star@@ ched collar that pressed against his cheeks , a bow@@ ler hat , and top boots .
he was calm and important as usual , and standing in front of the horse , was himself holding both its re@@ ins .
her fiery eyes turned on the approaching V@@ ron@@ sky .
V@@ ron@@ sky pushed his fingers under the gir@@ ths .
the Englis@@ hman p@@ uck@@ ered his lip , wishing to express a smile at anyone testing his sadd@@ ling .
V@@ ron@@ sky glanced round at his rivals for the last time .
two of them were already riding toward the starting @@@ -@@ @ point .
Gal@@ tsin , one of the formidable competitors and a friend of V@@ ron@@ sky 's , was struggling with a sor@@ rel g@@ el@@ ding that would not let him mount .
a short Hus@@ sar in tight riding @@@ -@@ @ bre@@ ech@@ es was gal@@ lo@@ ping along bun@@ ched up like a cat in his desire to imitate an English j@@ ockey .
Prince K@@ us@@ ov@@ le@@ v sat pale @@@ -@@ @ faced on his thorough@@ bred mare from the Gr@@ ab@@ ov stu@@ d farm , which an Englis@@ hman was leading by the bri@@ dle .
V@@ ron@@ sky and all his set knew K@@ us@@ ov@@ le@@ v and his peculiarities , which were weak nerves and terrible van@@ ity .
their eyes met and V@@ ron@@ sky win@@ ked at him kindly and appro@@ v@@ ingly .
the only one V@@ ron@@ sky did not see was his chief rival Mak@@ ho@@ tin on his G@@ lad@@ i@@ ator .
'@@ Don '@@ t hurry , ' said C@@ ord to V@@ ron@@ sky , ' and remember one thing : do not hold back or urge on your horse at an obstacle . let her have her way . '
'@@ Very well , very well , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky taking the re@@ ins .
'@@ Lead if you can , but do not despair till the last moment if you are behind . '
the mare had not time to stir before V@@ ron@@ sky with a powerful and agile movement put his foot in the not@@ ched steel stir@@ r@@ up and seated himself lightly but firmly on the cre@@ aking leather of the sadd@@ le .
having got his right foot also in its stir@@ r@@ up he strai@@ ghtened out the double re@@ ins between his practi@@ sed fingers , and C@@ ord removed his hand .
as if not knowing which foot to step on first , Fro@@ u @@@ -@@ @ Fro@@ u stretched the re@@ ins with her long neck , and started as if on springs , shaking her ri@@ der on her flexible back .
the res@@ tive horse tu@@ gged at the re@@ ins , now to one side , now to the other , trying to deceive her ri@@ der , and V@@ ron@@ sky v@@ ain@@ ly sought by voice and hand to soo@@ the her .
they were already approaching the dam@@ med @@@ -@@ @ up stream on their way to the starting @@@ -@@ @ post .
some of the riders were in front , some behind , when V@@ ron@@ sky suddenly heard a horse gal@@ lo@@ ping through the mud behind him , and Mak@@ ho@@ tin on his white @@@ -@@ @ leg@@ ged , large @@@ -@@ @ e@@ ared G@@ lad@@ i@@ ator went past him .
Mak@@ ho@@ tin smiled , showing his long teeth , but V@@ ron@@ sky looked at him an@@ gr@@ ily .
V@@ ron@@ sky always dis@@ liked him and now considered him his most dangerous rival , and he was v@@ exed with him for gal@@ lo@@ ping past and so exciting Fro@@ u @@@ -@@ @ Fro@@ u .
she broke into a can@@ ter , gave two le@@ aps , and , angry at the tightened rein , changed back into a jer@@ ky tro@@ t , j@@ ol@@ ting her ri@@ der .
cord also fro@@ w@@ ned , following V@@ ron@@ sky almost at a run .
it was to take place on the large four @@@ -@@ @ ver@@ st el@@ lip@@ tical course in front of the pavilion .
three times the riders drew up in line , but each time someone 's horse made a false start and they had to line up again .
Colonel Se@@ str@@ in , an expert star@@ ter , was already getting angry , but at last , at the fourth try , he shouted ' Go ! ' and the race began .
all eyes and all glasses were turned on the bright group of riders while they were getting into line .
'@@ They have started !
they are off ! ' was heard from every side after the h@@ ush of expectation ..
loo@@ kers @@@ -@@ @ on , in groups or sing@@ ly , started running from place to place to get a better view .
in the first minute the group of riders began to stretch out and could be seen in tw@@ os and thre@@ es , and one behind another , approaching the bro@@ ok .
it had looked to the public as if they had all started together , but the riders were aware of a difference of seconds which to them were of great importance .
in the first moments V@@ ron@@ sky was master neither of himself nor of his mare .
up to the first obstacle , the bro@@ ok , he could not control her movements .
these particul@@ ars V@@ ron@@ sky learned later , now he only saw that Diana 's head or legs might come just where Fro@@ u @@@ -@@ @ Fro@@ u had to ali@@ ght .
but Fro@@ u @@@ -@@ @ Fro@@ u , like a falling cat , made an effort with her legs and back while in the air , and clearing the other horse rushed on .
'@@ Oh , you dar@@ ling ! ' thought V@@ ron@@ sky .
after crossing the bro@@ ok V@@ ron@@ sky had the mare quite under control , and held her in , inten@@ ding to cross the big barrier behind Mak@@ ho@@ tin and then to try and pass him on the flat 300 yards before the next obstacle .
the big barrier was right in front of the Imperial Pavilion .
the Emperor , the whole Court , and crowds of people were all looking at them - at him and at Mak@@ ho@@ tin , who was a full length ahead of him when they approached the Devil ( as the solid barrier was called ) .
gl@@ adi@@ ator rose without touching anything , sw@@ ished his short tail , and disappeared from V@@ ron@@ sky 's sight .
'@@ Bra@@ vo ! ' shouted a single voice .
just then the boards of the barrier fl@@ ashed close before V@@ ron@@ sky 's eyes .
without the least change in her action his mare rose under him ; the boards disappeared , only behind him there was a knock .
but her pace did not change , and V@@ ron@@ sky , hit in the face by a lump of mud , realized that he was again at the same distance behind G@@ lad@@ i@@ ator .
he again saw before him that horse 's h@@ ind @@@ -@@ @ quarters , short tail and flashing white legs , no farther away ,
V@@ ron@@ sky had just time to think of coming up on the outside , when Fro@@ u @@@ -@@ @ Fro@@ u changed her legs and started to do so .
Fro@@ u @@@ -@@ @ Fro@@ u 's shoulder , which was already growing dark with sweat , was on a level with G@@ lad@@ i@@ ator 's h@@ ind @@@ -@@ @ quarters .
they ran side by side for a few strides , but before the obstacle they were approaching , V@@ ron@@ sky , not to lose ground , gave the mare her head and just on the dec@@ li@@ vity passed Mak@@ ho@@ tin .
he caught sight of his mud @@@ -@@ @ b@@ esp@@ attered face , and even thought he saw him smile .
he passed , but felt that Mak@@ ho@@ tin was close behind him , and continually heard just behind his back the regular beating of hoo@@ fs and the short , still fresh breathing of G@@ lad@@ i@@ ator 's no@@ str@@ ils .
the next two obstacles , a ditch and a fence , were easily passed , but V@@ ron@@ sky heard G@@ lad@@ i@@ ator gal@@ lo@@ ping and s@@ nor@@ ting closer .
he urged on his mare and felt with joy that she easily increased her speed , and he heard the sound of G@@ lad@@ i@@ ator 's hoo@@ fs again at the former distance behind .
V@@ ron@@ sky now had the lead , as he had wished and as C@@ ord had advised , and he was confident of success .
his excitement and joy , and his ten@@ derness for Fro@@ u @@@ -@@ @ Fro@@ u , grew stronger and stronger .
there remained the most difficult obstacle ; if he crossed it ahead of the others , he would come in first .
he was gal@@ lo@@ ping up to the Irish bank .
he and Fro@@ u @@@ -@@ @ Fro@@ u both saw the bank while still some way off , and to both of them came a mom@@ entary doubt .
'@@ Bra@@ vo , V@@ ron@@ sky ! ' he heard the voices of a knot of people he knew - friends of his regiment who were standing by this obstacle . he could not fail to recognize Y@@ ash@@ vin 's voice , though he did not see him .
'@@ Oh , my beauty ! ' he thought of Fro@@ u @@@ -@@ @ Fro@@ u , as he listened to what was happening behind .
'@@ He is over it ! ' he thought , as he heard G@@ lad@@ i@@ ator again gal@@ lo@@ ping behind him .
there remained one last water jump , only a yard and a half wide .
V@@ ron@@ sky did not even look at it , but hoping to win by a distance , began working the re@@ ins with a circular movement , raising and dropping the mare 's head in time with her stri@@ de .
but he knew that her reserve of strength was more than enough for the remaining five hundred yards .
it was only by feeling himself nearer to the ground and by the smoo@@ th@@ ness of the pace that V@@ ron@@ sky knew how much the mare had increased her speed .
he himself , without knowing it , had made the un@@ par@@ don@@ able mistake of dropping back in his sadd@@ le and pulling up her head .
before he could realize this , the white legs of the g@@ el@@ ding fl@@ ashed close by him and Mak@@ ho@@ tin passed at a rapid gal@@ lo@@ p .
but he only understood this much later .
still not understanding what had happened , V@@ ron@@ sky pulled at the re@@ ins .
the mare again began to struggle like a fish , causing the fl@@ aps of the sadd@@ le to cre@@ ak ; she got her front legs free , but unable to lift her h@@ ind @@@ -@@ @ quarters , struggled and immediately again fell on her side .
'@@ ah , ah , ah ! ' gro@@ an@@ ed V@@ ron@@ sky , seizing his head . ' Ah ! what have I done ? ' he exclaimed .
and this dear , unfortunate mare ruined !
Ah ! what have I done ! '
on@@ loo@@ kers , a doctor , an attendant , and officers of his regiment ran toward him .
to his regret he felt that he was himself sound and un@@ hurt .
the mare had broken her back , and it was decided to shoot her .
V@@ ron@@ sky was unable to reply to questions or to speak to anyone .
he turned away and , without picking up the cap that had fallen from his head , left the rac@@ ec@@ our@@ se without knowing where he was going .
for the first time in his life he experienced the worst kind of mis@@ fortune - one that was ir@@ retri@@ ev@@ able , and caused by his own fault .
Y@@ ash@@ vin over@@ took him with his cap and led him home , and in half an hour V@@ ron@@ sky came to himself .
but the memory of that ste@@ epl@@ ech@@ ase long remained the most painful and dist@@ ressing memory of his life .
externally K@@ aren@@ in 'S RE@@ L@@ ATIONS with his wife remained as before .
the only difference was that he was even more occupied than before .
and as usual his wife had moved to the country house while he remained in Petersburg .
he was rather col@@ der toward her .
he appeared only to be slightly dissatisfied with her for that first night 's talk which she had ev@@ aded .
in his behaviour to her there was a shade of v@@ ex@@ ation , but nothing more .
'@@ You did not wish to have an explanation , ' he seemed to say to her in imagination , ' so much the worse for you .
now you will ask me to expl@@ ain@@ . and I shall not do so .
he who was so wise and ast@@ ute in official affairs did not realize the in@@ sanity of such an attitude toward his wife .
he who had been a consider@@ ate father , since the end of that winter had become particularly cold toward his son , and treated him in the same ban@@ tering manner as he did his wife .
'@@ ah , young man ! ' was the way in which he addressed him .
that was why K@@ aren@@ in 's face bore a stern , proud expression when anyone asked about his wife 's health .
he did not wish to think about his wife 's conduct and feelings at all , and he really did not think about them .
the country house the K@@ aren@@ ins regularly occupied in summer was in Pet@@ er@@ hof , and generally the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna also lived near by and was in constant touch with Anna .
that year the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna refused to live in Pet@@ er@@ hof , did not once come to see Anna , and hin@@ ted to K@@ aren@@ in the un@@ desir@@ ability of Anna 's intim@@ acy with Bet@@ sy and V@@ ron@@ sky .
K@@ aren@@ in stopped her severely , expressing the opinion that his wife was above suspicion , and from that time began to avoid the Countess .
since his return from abroad K@@ aren@@ in had been twice at the country house .
once he d@@ ined there , and the other time he spent an evening with some visitors , but he had not once stayed the night , as he used to do in former years .
he would call on his wife , because he had decided to do so once a week for the sake of propri@@ ety .
besides , he had that day to give her money for her expenses , due according to their custom by the fif@@ teenth of each month .
having with the mental control habitual to him considered these matters concerning his wife , he did not allow his thoughts to run on further about her .
he had a very busy morning .
on the previous day the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna had sent him a pam@@ ph@@ let by a celebrated traveller in China , and a letter asking him to receive this traveller , who for various reasons was very interesting and necessary to them .
the latter did not keep him long .
but the doctor , a celebrated Petersburg physician who was on friendly terms with K@@ aren@@ in , took up a good deal of time .
K@@ aren@@ in had not expected him to @@@ -@@ @ day and was surprised to see him , and yet more surprised that the doctor questioned him very particularly about his state of health , sounding his chest and tapping and feeling his liver .
K@@ aren@@ in did not know that his friend Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna , having noticed that he was not in good health that summer , had asked the doctor to go and see his patient .
'@@ Do it for my sake , ' the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna had said .
'@@ i will do it for the sake of Russia , Countess , ' replied the doctor .
'@@ Dear man ! ' the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna had exclaimed .
in the por@@ ch , after leaving K@@ aren@@ in , the doctor met S@@ ly@@ ud@@ in , K@@ aren@@ in 's private secretary , whom he knew very well .
they had been at the University together , and though they very seldom met , they respected one another and were good friends , and to no one but S@@ ly@@ ud@@ in would the doctor have expressed his opinion about his patient .
'@@ i am very glad you have been to see him , ' said S@@ ly@@ ud@@ in . ' he is not well , and I believe that ...
at the same time as the traveller , a provincial Mar@@ sh@@ al of the Nob@@ ility was announced with whom K@@ aren@@ in had some things to talk over .
when he too had left , he had to finish his everyday business with his private secretary and had also to drive to see an important person@@ age on a grave and serious matter .
he only managed to get back at five , his dinner @@@ -@@ @ time , and having d@@ ined with his private secretary , he invited the latter to drive with him to his country house and to go to the races with him .
without acknowledging it to himself , K@@ aren@@ in now looked out for opportunities of having a third person present at his interviews with his wife .
'@@ It is too early for Bet@@ sy , ' she thought , and gl@@ ancing out of the window she saw the carriage , and sticking out of it a black hat and K@@ aren@@ in 's familiar ears . ' how unfortunate !
'@@ Oh , I will not separate the insepar@@ ables , ' he said in his usual fac@@ e@@ tious tone . ' I will go with S@@ ly@@ ud@@ in .
the doctors have ordered me to walk .
I will walk part way and imagine that I am still taking the waters . '
'@@ There is no hurry , ' said Anna . ' would you like some tea ? ' she rang .
'@@ Tea , please , and tell Ser@@ ez@@ ha that his father is here .
you have not been here before ; look how pretty my ver@@ and@@ ah is , ' she went on , turning now to her husband , now to S@@ ly@@ ud@@ in .
she spoke very simply and naturally , but too much and too fast .
she felt this herself , especially as by the inqui@@ sitive way S@@ ly@@ ud@@ in looked at her she noticed that he seemed to be watching her .
S@@ ly@@ ud@@ in immediately went out on to the ver@@ and@@ ah and she sat down by her husband .
'@@ You are not looking quite well , ' she said .
'@@ no , ' he replied , ' the doctor came to see me this morning and robbed me of an hour .
I feel that some friend of mine must have sent him : my health is so precious ... '
she said all this lightly , rapidly , and with peculi@@ arly sparkling eyes ; but K@@ aren@@ in did not now attach any importance to this tone of hers .
he only heard her words , and gave them only their direct meaning .
and he answered simply , though jo@@ kingly .
in all this conversation nothing particular passed , but never afterwards could Anna recall this short scene without being tor@@ m@@ ented by shame .
Ser@@ ez@@ ha came in , preceded by his govern@@ ess .
had K@@ aren@@ in allowed himself to observe , he would have noticed the tim@@ id , confused look which the child cast first at his father and then at his mother .
but he did not want to see , and did not see , anything .
he has grown .
he is really getting quite a man .
he looked round at his mother , as if asking for protection .
only with his mother he felt at ease .
K@@ aren@@ in meanwhile talked to the govern@@ ess with his hand on his son 's shoulder , and Ser@@ ez@@ ha felt so extremely uncomfortable that Anna saw he was about to cry .
'@@ no , I don '@@ t ... Yes , I do , ' she replied without looking at him , and bl@@ ushing to the roots of her hair . ' but I suppose you will call here after the races . '
'@@ What elegance !
the Princess T@@ ver@@ skaya did not get out , only her foot@@ man in his black hat , cape , and ga@@ it@@ ers jumped down at the front door .
'@@ i am going , good @@@ -@@ @ bye ! ' said Anna , and giving her son a kiss she went up to K@@ aren@@ in and held out her hand to him . ' you were very kind to come . '
K@@ aren@@ in kis@@ sed her hand .
you will come back for tea , that is right ! ' she said , and went out be@@ aming and gay .
but as soon as she ceased to see him she became conscious of the place on her hand his lips had touched and sh@@ ud@@ dered with dis@@ gust .
when K@@ aren@@ in appeared at the rac@@ ec@@ our@@ se Anna was already sitting beside Bet@@ sy in the Grand Stand : the stand where all the highest Society was assembled .
two men - her husband and her lover - were the two centres of her life , and without the aid of her senses she was aware of the presence of either .
from af@@ ar she already felt the approach of her husband , and involun@@ tarily watched him amid the surging crowd through which he was moving .
she knew all these ways of his and they were all re@@ pul@@ sive to her .
he smiled his usual cold smile .
'@@ There is so much spl@@ end@@ our here that my eyes are dazz@@ led , ' he replied , and approached the stand .
with him K@@ aren@@ in entered into conversation .
there was an interval between two races , so that nothing hindered the conversation .
K@@ aren@@ in replied , defending them .
Anna heard his high measured voice and did not miss a single word . each word seemed to her false and gr@@ ated painfully on her ear .
when the four @@@ -@@ @ ver@@ st ste@@ epl@@ ech@@ ase was beginning she leaned forward , and did not take her eyes off V@@ ron@@ sky while he went up to his horse and mounted it , and at the same time she heard her husband 's re@@ pul@@ sive , unc@@ easing voice .
she was tor@@ m@@ ented by anxiety for V@@ ron@@ sky , but suffered even more from what seemed to her the incess@@ ant flow of her husband 's shr@@ ill voice with its familiar int@@ on@@ ations .
'@@ i am a bad woman , a ruined woman , ' she thought , ' but I dislike lies . I C@@ AN@@ NOT stand false@@ hood , but his food is false@@ hood .
he knows everything , sees everything - what then does he feel , if he can talk so calmly ?
but no , lies and propri@@ ety is all he cares about , ' said Anna to herself , without considering what she really wanted of her husband or what she would have liked him to be .
nor did she understand that K@@ aren@@ in 's peculiar vol@@ ub@@ ility , which so irrit@@ ated her , was only an expression of the anxiety and unrest within him .
and as it is natural for the child to skip about , so it was natural for him to speak cl@@ ever@@ ly and well .
'@@ the danger in military , that is , cav@@ alry , ste@@ epl@@ ech@@ ases is an unavoidable element of the racing .
if England can point to the most brilliant cav@@ alry charges in military history , it is entirely due to the fact that she has historically developed this capacity in her men and horses .
sport in my opinion has great value , but we , as usual , see only what is most external . '
'@@ Not external at all , ' said the Princess T@@ ver@@ skaya .
K@@ aren@@ in smiled his usual smile , which showed his teeth but expressed nothing .
'@@ Gran@@ ted , Princess , ' said he , ' that that is not external but internal .
it is directly involved in their military duty .
'@@ no , I Sh@@ an '@@ t come again ; it exc@@ ites me too much , ' said the Princess Bet@@ sy . ' Don '@@ t you think so , Anna ? '
'@@ It is exciting , but one C@@ AN@@ NOT tear oneself away , ' said another lady . ' if I had been a Roman , I should never have missed a gl@@ adi@@ atorial show . '
interrup@@ ting his speech , K@@ aren@@ in rose hur@@ ri@@ edly , but with dignity , and bowed low to this general .
'@@ You are not racing , ' said the latter to him jo@@ kingly .
'@@ My race is a harder one , ' replied K@@ aren@@ in respec@@ tfully .
and though the answer did not mean anything , the general made as though he had heard a clever reply from a clever man , and quite appreciated la Po@@ in@@ te de la sauce . '
'@@ There are two sides to it , ' continued K@@ aren@@ in , ' that of the performers and that of the spectators . the love of such spectac@@ les is the su@@ rest proof of low development in the on@@ loo@@ kers , I admit , but ... '
'@@ Princess , a bet ! ' came the voice of O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky from below , addressing Bet@@ sy . ' whom are you backing ? '
'@@ Anna and I are betting on Kuz@@ ov@@ le@@ v , ' replied Bet@@ sy .
'@@ And I on V@@ ron@@ sky .
K@@ aren@@ in was silent while others were speaking near him , but began again immediately .
'@@ i agree that un@@ man@@ ly sports ... ' he was continuing .
but at that moment the race began and all conversation ceased .
K@@ aren@@ in was silent too , as everybody rose and turned their eyes toward the stream .
K@@ aren@@ in was not interested in races and therefore did not watch the riders , but began absent @@@ -@@ @ min@@ dedly looking at the spectators with his weary eyes .
her face was pale and stern .
he looked at her and hur@@ ri@@ edly turned away , scrutin@@ izing other faces .
'@@ Yes , that lady - and those others - are very excited too ; it is quite natural , ' he said to himself .
he did not wish to look at her , but his eyes were involun@@ tarily drawn toward her .
he again watched her face , trying not to read what was so plainly written on it , but against his will he read in it with horror that which he did not want to know .
the first fall - Kuz@@ ov@@ le@@ v 's at the stream - excited every one , but K@@ aren@@ in saw clearly by Anna 's pale , triumph@@ ant face that he whom she was watching had not fallen .
he looked at her more and more often , and more int@@ ently .
she glanced for an instant at him with a look of inquiry , and , slightly fro@@ w@@ ning , turned away again .
'@@ Oh , I don '@@ t care , ' she seemed to say to him , and then did not once look at him again .
the ste@@ epl@@ ech@@ ase was un@@ lucky : more than half of the seventeen officers were thrown and hurt .
by the end of the race every one was disturbed , and this disturbance was increased by the fact that the Emperor was dis@@ pleased .
but afterwards a change came over Anna 's face which was positively improper .
she began to fl@@ utter like a captive bird , now rising to go , now addressing Bet@@ sy .
but Bet@@ sy did not hear her .
she was leaning over to speak to a General who was below .
K@@ aren@@ in approached Anna and pol@@ itely offered her his arm . ' come , if you like , ' he said in French ; but Anna listened to what the General was saying and did not notice her husband .
'@@ He too has broken his leg , they say . it 's too bad , ' the General said .
Anna , without repl@@ ying to her husband , raised her glasses and looked toward the spot where V@@ ron@@ sky had fallen ; but it was so far off , and so many people had crowded there , that it was impossible to distinguish anything .
she put down her glasses and was about to go ; but at that moment an officer gal@@ lo@@ ped up and reported something to the Emperor .
Anna bent forward to listen .
but he did not hear her .
'@@ i again offer you my arm if you wish to go , ' said her husband , touching her arm .
with a look of re@@ pulsion she drew back , and without looking at him replied :
'@@ no , no , leave me alone , I shall stay here . '
she now saw an officer running to the Grand Stand from the place where V@@ ron@@ sky had fallen .
the officer brought the news that the ri@@ der was un@@ hurt but that the horse had broken its back .
on hearing this Anna quickly sat down and hid her face behind her fan .
K@@ aren@@ in saw that she was crying , and that she was unable to keep back either her tears or the so@@ bs that made her bos@@ om he@@ ave .
he stepped forward so as to screen her , giving her time to recover .
'@@ For the third time I offer you my arm , ' he said after a while , turning toward her .
the Princess Bet@@ sy came to her aid .
'@@ no , Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich , ' she put in , ' I brought Anna here and I have promised to take her back again . '
'@@ Exc@@ use me , Princess , ' he said , smiling pol@@ itely but looking her firmly in the eyes , ' but I see that Anna is not very well , and I wish her to come with me . '
'@@ i will send to him and find out , and will let you know , ' Bet@@ sy whispered to her .
'@@ is he hurt or not ?
shall I see him to @@@ -@@ @ night ? ' she thought .
in spite of all he had seen , K@@ aren@@ in would still not allow himself to think of his wife 's real position .
he only saw the external sights .
he saw that she had behaved with impro@@ pri@@ ety and he considered it his duty to tell her so .
but it was very difficult for him to say that and nothing more .
he opened his mouth to say that she had behaved impro@@ per@@ ly , but involun@@ tarily said something quite different .
'@@ After all , how inclined we all are to these cruel spectac@@ les , ' he said . ' I notice ... '
'@@ What ? I do not understand , ' said Anna cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ously .
he was offended and at once began to tell her what he wanted to .
'@@ i must tell you ... ' he said .
'@@ i must tell you that you behaved impro@@ per@@ ly to @@@ -@@ @ day , ' he said in French .
'@@ Don '@@ t forget , ' said he to her , pointing at the open window behind the co@@ ach@@ man 's box ; and , slightly rising , he lifted the window .
'@@ What did you consider improper ? ' she asked again .
'@@ the despair you were unable to conceal when one of the riders fell . '
'@@ i asked you once before to conduct yourself in Society so that evil tongues might be unable to say anything against you .
there was a time when I spoke about inner relations ; now I do not speak of them .
I speak now of external relations .
your conduct was improper and I do not wish it to occur again . '
she did not hear half that he said , but felt afraid of him and wondered whether it was true that V@@ ron@@ sky was not hurt .
she only smiled with simul@@ ated irony when he had finished ; and she did not reply because she had not heard what he said .
K@@ aren@@ in had begun to speak boldly but when he realized clearly what he was talking about the fear she was experiencing communicated itself to him .
he saw her smile and a strange delusion possessed him .
'@@ She smiles at my suspicions .
in a moment she will tell me what she told me then : that these suspicions are ground@@ less and ridiculous . '
now that a complete disclosure was impending , he expected nothing so much as that she would , as before , answer him mock@@ ingly that his suspicions were ridiculous and ground@@ less .
what he knew was so terrible that he was now prepared to believe anything .
but the expression of her frightened and gloomy face did not now even promise deception .
'@@ Per@@ haps I am mistaken , ' said he . ' in that case I beg your pardon . '
'@@ no , you were not mistaken , ' she said slowly , looking des@@ pair@@ ingly into his cold face . ' you were not mistaken .
I was , and C@@ AN@@ NOT help being , in despair .
I listen to you but I am thinking of him .
do what you like to me . '
as they were driving up to it , he turned his face to her still with the same expression and said :
but I demand that the external conditions of propri@@ ety shall be observed till ' - his voice trem@@ bled - ' till I take measures to safeguard my honour and inform you of them . '
he ali@@ ghted first and helped her out .
in the presence of the servants he pressed her hand , re @@@ -@@ @ entered the carriage , and drove off toward Petersburg .
after he had gone the Princess Bet@@ sy 's foot@@ man brought Anna a note .
'@@ i sent to Alex@@ is to inqu@@ ire about his health . he writes that he is safe and sound , but in despair . '
'@@ Then he will come , ' thought she . ' what a good thing it is that I spoke out . '
'@@ Dear me , how light it is !
it is dreadful , but I love to see his face , and I love this fantastic light ...
'@@ F@@ ür@@ st Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky sam@@ m@@ t G@@ em@@ ah@@ lin und To@@ ch@@ ter , ' [ Prince Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky with his wife and daughter . ] by the premises they occupied , by their name , and by the people they were acquainted with , at once crystalli@@ zed into their definite and pre@@ ordained place .
Kit@@ ty made a low and graceful cur@@ ts@@ y in her very simple dress - that is to say , very stylish summer g@@ own ordered from Paris .
the Royal Princess said : ' I hope the roses will soon return to this pretty little face , ' and at once a definite path was firmly established for the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys from which it was impossible to devi@@ ate .
they made acquaintance with the family of an English ' Lady , ' with a German Countess and her son who had been wounded in the last war , with a Swedish sav@@ ant and with a Mr. Can@@ ut and his sister .
when all this had become firmly established , Kit@@ ty began to feel very dull , especially as her father had gone to Car@@ ls@@ bad and she was left alone with her mother .
she was not interested in the people she knew , for she felt that nothing new would come from them .
her chief private interest at the wat@@ ering @@@ -@@ @ place consisted in observing those whom she did not know and making con@@ jec@@ tures about them .
it was a characteristic of Kit@@ ty 's always to expect to find the most excellent qualities in people , especially in those she did not know .
among these people she was specially interested in a young Russian girl who had come to the wat@@ ering @@@ -@@ @ place with an invalid Russian lady , Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l , as every one called her .
Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l belonged to the highest Society , but she was so ill that she could not walk , and only on fine days occasionally appeared on the pro@@ men@@ ade in a bath @@@ -@@ @ chair .
but not so much from illness as from pride , as the Princess Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ skaya explained - Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l was not acquainted with any of the Russians there .
the Russian girl looked after Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l , and also , as Kit@@ ty noticed , became intimate with all those who were seriously ill ( of whom there were many in the place ) and waited on them in the most natural way .
this Russian girl , Kit@@ ty decided , was not related to Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l , but neither was she a paid companion .
Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l called her by the dimin@@ utive ' V@@ aren@@ ka , ' and others called her M@@ adem@@ o@@ is@@ elle V@@ aren@@ ka .
this M@@ l@@ le V@@ aren@@ ka was not exactly past her early youth , but seemed to be a person des@@ tit@@ ute of you@@ th@@ fulness : she might be ninet@@ een years old or she might be thirty .
if one examined her features , she was good @@@ -@@ @ looking rather than plain , despite her unhealthy compl@@ exi@@ on .
her figure would have been good had she not been too lean and her head too large for her medium height ; but she was not likely to prove attractive to men .
she was like a beautiful flower which though not yet in full blo@@ om is already beginning to fade and has no scent .
another reason why she could not be attractive to men was because she lacked that of which Kit@@ ty had too much - a restrained flame of vitality and consciousness of her own attractiveness .
she seemed always occupied with something there could be no doubt about , and therefore it seemed that no side issue could interest her .
by this contrast to herself Kit@@ ty was specially attracted .
the more Kit@@ ty observed her unknown friend , the more she was convinced that this girl really was the perfect being she imagined her to be , and the more she wished to make her acquaintance .
the two girls came across one another several times a day , and every time they met Kit@@ ty 's eyes said : ' who are you ?
what are you ? surely you are the delightful creature I imagine you to be ?
but for heaven 's sake ' - her look added - ' do not think that I shall force myself on you .
I simply admire and love you . ' ' I too love you , and you are very , very sweet .
I should love you still more if I had the time , ' the stranger 's look replied .
soon after the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys ' arrival , two new persons who provoked everybody 's dis@@ approval began to appear of a morning at the W@@ ells .
having recognized them to be Russians , Kit@@ ty at once began to make up a beautiful and touching romance about them .
but the Princess , having found out from the visitors ' list that they were Nicholas Levin and Mary Ivan@@ ovna , explained to Kit@@ ty what a bad man this Levin was , and all her dreams about those two people vanished .
not so much because of what her mother had told her , as because the man was Constan@@ tine 's brother , these two people appeared very dis@@ agre@@ eable to Kit@@ ty .
this Levin , by his habit of jer@@ king his head , now inspired an irre@@ pres@@ sible feeling of aver@@ sion in her .
it seemed to her that his large , dreadful eyes , which followed her insist@@ ently , expressed hatred and irony , and she tried to avoid en@@ countering him .
it W@@ AS A dull DA@@ Y , it rained the whole morning , and the patients with their umbrel@@ las crowded the covered gallery .
Kit@@ ty was walking with her mother and the Moscow Colonel , who sw@@ agg@@ ered g@@ aily in his short , German coat , bought ready @@@ -@@ @ made in Frank@@ fort .
they kept to one side of the gallery , trying to avoid Levin , who was walking on the other side .
V@@ aren@@ ka , in her dark dress and a black hat with turned @@@ -@@ @ down rim , was pac@@ ing the whole length of the gallery with a blind French@@ woman , and each time she met Kit@@ ty they exchanged a friendly look .
'@@ M@@ ama , may I speak to her ? ' asked Kit@@ ty , following her unknown friend with her eyes and noticing that she was moving toward the Well and that they could meet her there .
'@@ Well , if you want to so much , I will inqu@@ ire about her first and will speak to her myself , ' answered her mother . ' what do you see particular in her ?
I expect she 's a companion .
if you like I will make Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l 's acquaintance .
Kit@@ ty knew that her mother was offended that Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l seemed to avoid making her acquaintance .
'@@ She is wonder@@ fully sweet ! ' she said , looking at V@@ aren@@ k@@ a. who was handing a tum@@ bler to the French@@ woman . ' see how naturally and swe@@ etly she does it . '
they were just turning to go back , when they suddenly heard voices not merely loud , but shouting .
Levin had stopped and was shouting , and the doctor was also excited .
a crowd collected about them .
the Princess and Kit@@ ty withdrew hur@@ ri@@ edly , but the Colonel joined the crowd to find out what the noise was all about .
'@@ What was the matter ? ' asked the Princess .
'@@ It 's shameful and scand@@ al@@ ous , ' replied the Colonel . ' the one thing to fear is meeting Russians abroad .
that tall gentleman has been quar@@ rel@@ ling with the doctor and insul@@ ting him , because he is dissatisfied with the doctor 's treatment . he shook his stick at him !
'@@ ah , how unpleasant ! ' said the Princess . ' but how did it all end ? '
'@@ Luc@@ kily that ... you know the girl with a hat like a mush@@ room - she 's Russian , I think - intervened , ' said the Colonel .
'@@ M@@ l@@ le V@@ aren@@ ka ? ' asked Kit@@ ty in a pleased tone .
'@@ There , M@@ ama , ' said Kit@@ ty . ' and you are surprised that I admire her . '
she went up to them , talked to them , and acted as interpreter for the woman , who spoke nothing but Russian .
choosing a moment when her daughter had gone to the Well and V@@ aren@@ ka had stopped in front of a b@@ aker 's shop , the Princess went up to her .
'@@ It is more than mutual , Princess , ' replied V@@ aren@@ ka hur@@ ri@@ edly .
'@@ What a good action you performed yesterday for our unfortunate fellow @@@ -@@ @ country@@ man ! ' said the Princess .
V@@ aren@@ ka bl@@ ushed .
'@@ i don '@@ t remember ; I don '@@ t think I did anything , ' said she .
'@@ Oh , yes , you saved that Levin from un@@ pleas@@ ant@@ ness . '
'@@ Well , you see , his companion called me , and I tried to soo@@ the him ; he is very ill and was dissatisfied with his doctor .
I am used to looking after inv@@ ali@@ ds of that kind . '
'@@ Oh , yes , I have heard that you live in M@@ ent@@ one with your aunt , I think , Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l .
I call her M@@ ama , but I am not related to her . she adopted me , ' answered V@@ aren@@ ka , and bl@@ ushed again .
this was said so simply , and the frank and open expression of her face was so am@@ i@@ able , that the Princess understood what made Kit@@ ty so fond of this V@@ aren@@ ka .
'@@ Well , and what about that Levin ? '
'@@ He is leaving , ' answered V@@ aren@@ ka .
just then Kit@@ ty , be@@ aming with joy that her mother had made acquaintance with her unknown friend , returned from the Well .
'@@ There , Kit@@ ty , your great wish to make acquaintance with M@@ l@@ le ... '
'@@ V@@ aren@@ ka , ' prompted V@@ aren@@ ka with a smile , ' everybody calls me so . '
but though her hand did not return the pressure , M@@ l@@ le V@@ aren@@ ka 's face shone with a soft and pleased , though rather sad , smile , which disclosed her large but splendid teeth .
'@@ V@@ aren@@ ka , M@@ ama wants you ! ' they shouted .
the particul@@ ars THE Princess SH@@ CH@@ ER@@ B@@ AT@@ SK@@ A@@ Y@@ A learnt about V@@ aren@@ ka 's past and about her relations with Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l , and about Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l herself , were the following :
Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l , of whom some people said that she had tor@@ m@@ ented her husband to death , while others said that , by his immoral conduct , he had tor@@ m@@ ented her , had always been a sick@@ ly and ec@@ static woman .
that child was V@@ aren@@ ka .
Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l learnt afterwards that V@@ aren@@ ka was not her daughter , but continued to bring her up , the more readily because it happened that very soon V@@ aren@@ ka had no relations left .
Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l had lived continuously abroad in the South for more than ten years , hardly ever leaving her bed .
no one knew what her religion was : Roman Catholic , Protestant , or Greek Orthodox , but one thing was certain , namely , that she was in friendly relations with the most highly @@@ -@@ @ placed person@@ ages of all the churches and denominations .
V@@ aren@@ ka always lived with her abroad , and all who knew Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l knew and liked M@@ l@@ le V@@ aren@@ ka , as everybody called her .
when she had made V@@ aren@@ ka 's acquaintance Kit@@ ty became more and more fascinated by her friend and found new virtues in her every day .
the Princess , having heard that V@@ aren@@ ka sang very well , invited her to come and sing to them one evening .
V@@ aren@@ ka , however , came in the evening and brought her music .
V@@ aren@@ ka did not seem at all ab@@ ashed by the fact that strangers were present , and she went straight up to the piano .
she could not accompany herself but she sang at sight admir@@ ably .
Kit@@ ty , who played well , accompanied her .
'@@ You have an exceptional talent , ' said the Princess , after V@@ aren@@ ka had sung her first song excell@@ ently .
Mary Ev@@ gen@@ y@@ evna and her daughter thanked her and praised her singing .
'@@ See , ' said the Colonel , looking out of the window , ' what an audience has assembled to hear you . ' underneath the window a considerable crowd really had collected .
'@@ i am very glad it gives you pleasure , ' said V@@ aren@@ ka simply .
Kit@@ ty looked at her friend with pride .
'@@ If it were I , ' thought Kit@@ ty , ' how proud I should feel !
but she is quite indifferent .
she only wished not to refuse , and to give M@@ ama pleasure .
what is it in her ?
what gives her this power to disregard everything and to be so quietly independent ?
how I should like to know this , and to learn it from her ! ' thought Kit@@ ty , gaz@@ ing into the calm face .
the Princess asked V@@ aren@@ ka to sing again , and she sang another song just as truly , clearly , and well , standing straight at the piano , and beating time on it with her thin brown hand .
the next piece in the music book was an Italian song .
Kit@@ ty played the pre@@ lu@@ de and looked round at V@@ aren@@ ka .
'@@ Let us skip this one , ' said V@@ aren@@ ka , bl@@ ushing .
Kit@@ ty anxi@@ ously and inqu@@ ir@@ ingly fixed her eyes on V@@ aren@@ ka 's face .
'@@ Well then , another one , ' she said , hur@@ ri@@ edly turning over the pages , immediately realizing that there was something particular connected with that song .
'@@ no , ' answered V@@ aren@@ ka , putting her hand on the music and smiling . ' no , let us sing that one . ' and she sang the piece just as calmly , col@@ dly , and well as the previous ones .
when she had finished everybody again thanked her and went to drink tea .
but Kit@@ ty and V@@ aren@@ ka went out into the little garden belonging to the house .
'@@ am I not right , you have some memory attached to that song ? ' asked Kit@@ ty . ' Don '@@ t tell me about it , ' she added hur@@ ri@@ edly , ' only say if I am right ! '
I will tell you , ' said V@@ aren@@ ka simply and without waiting for a reply continued : ' yes , there is a memory attached to it and it was painful once .
I loved a man and used to sing that song to him . '
Kit@@ ty , deeply moved , gaz@@ ed silently with wide @@@ -@@ @ open eyes at V@@ aren@@ ka .
'@@ i loved him and he loved me ; but his mother would not have it , and he married another .
he lives not far from us now , and I see him sometimes .
you did not think that I too have had a romance ? ' she said , and on her handsome face there fl@@ ick@@ ered for an instant a spark of the fire which , Kit@@ ty felt , had once lighted up her whole being .
why , if I were a man I could not have loved anyone else after knowing you .
but I can '@@ t understand how , to satisfy his mother , he could forget you and make you unhappy . he must be quite hear@@ tless . '
'@@ Oh no . he is a very good man , and I am not unhappy ; on the contrary , I am very happy .
well , we Sh@@ an '@@ t sing any more to @@@ -@@ @ day ? ' she added , and went toward the house .
'@@ How good you are , how good ! ' exclaimed Kit@@ ty , stopping her and kis@@ sing her . ' if only I could be a little bit like you ! '
'@@ Why should you be like anyone ?
you 're very good as you are , ' said V@@ aren@@ ka , smiling her gentle , weary smile .
'@@ no , I am not at all good .
wait a bit , let us sit down again , ' said Kit@@ ty , making V@@ aren@@ ka sit down on a garden seat beside her . ' tell me , is it possible that you are not offended at the thought that a man desp@@ ised your love ?
'@@ But he did not desp@@ ise it ; I believe that he loved me , but he was an obedient son ... '
'@@ Then he would have behaved badly and I should not regret him , ' replied V@@ aren@@ ka , evidently conscious that they were now speaking not about her but about Kit@@ ty .
'@@ But the humiliation ? ' said Kit@@ ty . ' one C@@ AN@@ NOT forget the humiliation , one C@@ AN@@ NOT , ' and she remembered the look she gave V@@ ron@@ sky at the ball , when the music stopped .
'@@ Where is the humiliation ?
you did not do anything wrong ? '
'@@ Wor@@ se than wrong , shameful . '
'@@ Sh@@ ame@@ ful in what respect ? ' she said . ' you could not have told a man who was himself indifferent to you that you loved him ? '
no , no ; there are such things as looks and ways of behaving .
the question is , do you love him now or not ? ' said V@@ aren@@ ka , calling everything by its plain name .
'@@ the shame , the humiliation ... '
'@@ Dear me , if every one were as sensitive as you are ! ' said V@@ aren@@ ka . ' there is no girl who has not gone through the same sort of thing .
and it is all so un@@ important . '
'@@ Then what is important ? ' asked Kit@@ ty , looking into her face with surprised curiosity .
'@@ ah , many things are important , ' replied V@@ aren@@ ka , not knowing what to say .
either take a sha@@ w@@ l or come in . '
Kit@@ ty held her hands , and with passionate curiosity and ent@@ reat@@ y questioned V@@ aren@@ ka with her eyes : ' what - what is most important ? what gives you such peace ?
but V@@ aren@@ ka did not even understand what Kit@@ ty 's eyes were asking .
she only knew that she had to call on Mad@@ ame Ber@@ the and get home in time for M@@ ama 's midnight tea .
she went in , collected her music , and having said good @@@ -@@ @ night to everybody , prepared to go .
Kit@@ ty noticed that V@@ aren@@ ka had difficulty in suppressing a smile at the idea that she needed anyone to see her home .
'@@ Oh no , I always go out alone and nothing ever happens to me , ' she said , taking up her hat .
Kit@@ ty AL@@ SO B@@ EC@@ AME acquainted with Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l , and this acquain@@ t@@ anc@@ eship , together with V@@ aren@@ ka 's friendship not only had a great influence on Kit@@ ty , but comfor@@ ted her in her sorrow .
it was revealed to her that besides that instinc@@ tive life she had lived hitherto there was also a spiritual life .
but however lofty may have been Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l 's character , however touching her story , and however elevated and tender her words , Kit@@ ty could not help noticing some perpl@@ exing traits in her .
she noticed that Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l , when inqu@@ iring about Kit@@ ty 's relatives , smiled cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ously , which did not accord with Christian kindness .
and once , when Kit@@ ty met a Roman Catholic priest at the house , she observed that Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l carefully hid her face behind the lam@@ p@@ shade and smiled in a peculiar manner .
tri@@ fling as these things were , they disturbed Kit@@ ty , and she felt doubts about Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l .
but V@@ aren@@ ka , lonely , without relatives or friends , with her sad disillu@@ sion@@ ment , wishing for nothing and regre@@ tting nothing , person@@ i@@ fied that perfection of which Kit@@ ty only allowed herself to dream .
in V@@ aren@@ ka she saw that it was only necessary to forget oneself and to love others in order to be at peace , happy , and lovely .
and such a person Kit@@ ty wished to be .
having now clearly understood what was most important , Kit@@ ty was not content merely to delight in it , but immediately with her whole soul devoted herself to this newly revealed life .
she formed a plan for her future life , based on what V@@ aren@@ ka told her about the work of Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l and of others whom she named .
the idea of reading the Gos@@ p@@ els to criminals , as A@@ line did , char@@ med Kit@@ ty particularly .
but all these were secret dreams , which she did not speak of either to her mother or to V@@ aren@@ ka .
at first the Princess only noticed that Kit@@ ty was strongly influenced by her eng@@ ou@@ ment , [ inf@@ at@@ uation . ] as she called it , for Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l and especially for V@@ aren@@ ka .
she noticed that Kit@@ ty not only im@@ itated V@@ aren@@ ka 's activities , but involun@@ tarily copied her manner of walking , speaking , and bl@@ inking her eyes .
but afterwards the Princess also noticed that , apart from this inf@@ at@@ uation , a serious spiritual change was taking place in her daughter .
Kit@@ ty evidently pri@@ ded herself on fulfilling the duties of a sister @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ mercy in that family .
this was all very well , and the Princess had nothing against it , especially as Pet@@ rov 's wife was quite a well @@@ -@@ @ bred woman , and the German Princess , having noticed Kit@@ ty 's activities , praised her , calling her a minist@@ ering angel .
it would have been quite right had it not been over@@ done .
but the Princess saw that her daughter was getting out of bounds and spoke to her about it .
but her daughter did not reply ; she only felt in her soul that one could not speak of over@@ doing Christianity .
how was it possible to exagg@@ erate , when following the teaching which bids us turn the other cheek when we are struck , and give our coat when our cloak is taken ?
but the Princess dis@@ liked this excess , and dis@@ liked it all the more because she felt that Kit@@ ty did not wish to open her whole heart to her .
and Kit@@ ty really did hide her new views and feelings from her mother .
she kept them secret not from want of respect and love , but just because her mother was her mother .
she would have revealed them to anyone sooner than to her .
'@@ i invited her and she did not seem pleased . '
'@@ i did not notice anything , M@@ ama , ' said Kit@@ ty , fl@@ ushing up .
'@@ is it long since you went to see them ? '
'@@ Well , go if you like , ' said the Princess , looking int@@ ently into her daughter 's confused face and trying to guess the cause of her confusion .
that same day V@@ aren@@ ka came to dinner , and said that Anna Pavlov@@ na had changed her mind about going to the mountains tomorrow .
'@@ Kit@@ ty , have you not had some un@@ pleas@@ ant@@ ness with the Pet@@ rov@@ s ? ' the Princess asked when they were again alone together . ' why has she stopped sending the children here and coming herself ? '
Kit@@ ty replied that nothing had passed between them and that she did not at all understand why Anna Pavlov@@ na seemed dissatisfied with her .
Kit@@ ty spoke the truth : she did not know why Anna Pavlov@@ na had changed toward her , but she guessed it .
she guessed it to be something that she could not tell her mother and did not even say to herself .
it was one of those things which one knows and yet C@@ AN@@ NOT say even to oneself - so dreadful and shameful would it be to make a mistake .
again and again she went over in memory all the relations she had had with that family .
how good it had all been !
she remembered her first efforts to conquer the re@@ pulsion she felt for him , as for all consu@@ mp@@ tives , and her efforts to find something to say to him .
she remembered the tim@@ id look , full of emotion , with which he gaz@@ ed at her , and the strange feeling of compassion and awk@@ wardness followed by a consciousness of her own ben@@ evol@@ ence , that she had experienced .
how good it had all been !
but all that had been at first .
now for some days past all had suddenly been spo@@ ilt .
Anna Pavlov@@ na now met Kit@@ ty with affected am@@ i@@ ability and constantly watched her husband and her .
could his touching pleasure when she drew near be the cause of Anna Pavlov@@ na 's col@@ dness ?
'@@ Yes , and perhaps my giving him his pl@@ aid may also have been unpleasant to her .
it was such a simple thing , but he took it so awk@@ war@@ dly , and thanked me so much that I myself felt awkward .
and then that portrait of me , which he did so well !
and above all - that look , confused and tender ...
yes , yes , it is so ! ' Kit@@ ty said to herself quite horri@@ fied ; and then , ' No , it is impossible , it must not be !
this doubt poisoned her delight in her new life .
quite TO@@ W@@ ARD THE EN@@ D OF THE SE@@ AS@@ ON Prince Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky , who from Car@@ ls@@ bad had gone on to Baden and Kis@@ sing@@ en to see some Russian friends and to ' in@@ hale some Russian spirit , ' as he expressed it , returned to his family .
the views of the Prince and Princess on life abroad were di@@ ame@@ tr@@ ically opposed .
he returned looking thinner , with the skin on his cheeks hanging loose , but in the brightest of spirits .
his spirits were still better when he saw Kit@@ ty completely recovered .
but these unpleasant rumours were soon drowned in that sea of kind @@@ -@@ @ hearted cheer@@ fulness which was always within him and which was increased by the Car@@ ls@@ bad water .
the day after his arrival the Prince , at@@ tired in a long over@@ coat , and with his Russian wrinkles , and his slightly pu@@ ffy cheeks supported by a stiff collar , went out in the brightest of spirits to the Springs with his daughter .
Kit@@ ty was no longer struck by this contrast .
'@@ Intro@@ duce me , introduce me to your new friends , ' he said to his daughter , pressing her arm with his el@@ bow . ' I have even taken a liking to your nasty So@@ den because it has done you so much good .
Kit@@ ty told him the names of the acquaintances and others whom they met .
just at the entrance to the gardens they met the blind Mad@@ ame Ber@@ the with her guide , and the Prince was pleased by the tender look on the old French@@ woman 's face when she heard Kit@@ ty 's voice .
'@@ Oh , M@@ l@@ le V@@ aren@@ ka is a real angel , al@@ le@@ z , ' said Mad@@ ame Ber@@ the .
in the gallery they met V@@ aren@@ ka herself .
she was walking hur@@ ri@@ edly toward them with an elegant little red bag in her hand .
'@@ of course I know you , I 've heard all about you , ' the Prince said to her with a smile , by which Kit@@ ty saw with joy that her father liked V@@ aren@@ ka . ' where are you hur@@ rying so to ? '
'@@ M@@ ama is here , ' said she , turning to Kit@@ ty . ' she did not sleep all night and the doctor advised her to go out .
'@@ i knew her husband and her too , slightly , before she joined the Pi@@ e@@ tists . '
'@@ What are Pi@@ e@@ tists , Pap@@ a ? ' asked Kit@@ ty , frightened by the fact that what she valued so highly in Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l had a name .
'@@ i don '@@ t know very well myself .
I only know that she thanks God for everything , including all mis@@ fortunes , ... and thanks God for her husband 's death .
and it seems funny , for they did not get on well together ...
who is that ? what a p@@ iti@@ ful face , ' he said , noticing an invalid of medium height who sat on a bench in a brown coat and white trous@@ ers which fell into strange fol@@ ds over his em@@ aci@@ ated legs .
the man raised his straw hat above his thin cur@@ ly hair , un@@ covering a tall forehead with an unhealthy redness where the hat had pressed it .
'@@ Poor man , what a nice face he has ! ' said the Prince . ' why did you not go up to him ?
'@@ Well , come back then , ' said Kit@@ ty , turning resolutely . ' how are you to @@@ -@@ @ day ? ' she asked Pet@@ rov .
Pet@@ rov rose with the aid of a stick and looked tim@@ idly at the Prince .
'@@ This is my daughter , ' said the Prince , ' allow me to introduce myself . '
the artist bowed and smiled , exposing his strangely g@@ listening white teeth .
'@@ We were expecting you yesterday , Princess , ' he said to Kit@@ ty .
he stagg@@ ered as he said it , and to make it appear as if he had done this intentionally , he repeated the movement .
'@@ i meant to come , but V@@ aren@@ ka told me that Anna Pavlov@@ na sent word that you were not going . '
'@@ Not going ? ' said Pet@@ rov , fl@@ ushing and immediately beginning to cough and looking round for his wife . ' An@@ net@@ ta , An@@ net@@ ta ! ' he said loudly , and the veins in his white neck pro@@ tru@@ ded like thick cor@@ ds .
'@@ How is it you sent word to the Princess that we were not going ? ' he said in an irrit@@ able whis@@ per , his voice failing him .
I thought we were not going , ' said his wife with v@@ ex@@ ation .
'@@ How so ? when ... ' he was interrupted by a fit of c@@ ough@@ ing , and made a hopeless gesture with his hand .
'@@ Yes , Pap@@ a , ' replied Kit@@ ty . ' and you know they have three children , no servants , and hardly any means .
he receives something from the Academy , ' she explained anim@@ at@@ edly , trying to stifle the excitement resulting from the strange alter@@ ation in Anna Pavlov@@ na 's manner toward her .
'@@ And there 's Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l , ' said Kit@@ ty , pointing to a bath @@@ -@@ @ chair on which , under a sun@@ shade , lay something supported by pil@@ lows , wrapped up in grey and pale @@@ -@@ @ blue .
behind her was a sul@@ len @@@ -@@ @ looking , robust German work@@ man who pushed her bath @@@ -@@ @ chair .
at her side stood a fair @@@ -@@ @ haired Swedish Count , whom Kit@@ ty knew by name .
several patients ling@@ ered near by , gaz@@ ing at this lady as at something out of the common .
the Prince approached her , and Kit@@ ty immediately noticed in his eyes that ir@@ on@@ ical spark which so disturbed her .
he went up to Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l , and spoke to her extremely pol@@ itely and nicely in that excellent French which so very few people speak nowadays .
'@@ i do not know whether you will remember me , but I must recall myself to you in order to thank you for your kindness to my daughter , ' he said , raising his hat and not putting it on again .
'@@ Prince Alexander Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky , ' said Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l , lifting toward him her heavenly eyes , in which Kit@@ ty detected dis@@ pleasure . ' I am very pleased .
'@@ no , but I am accustomed to it , ' said Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l and introduced the Swedish Count to the Prince .
'@@ You are very little changed , ' said the Prince . ' I have not had the honour of seeing you for ten or eleven years . '
it often seems strange to think why this life should drag on ...
on that side ! ' she said irrit@@ ably to V@@ aren@@ ka , who was not wrap@@ ping the pl@@ aid round her feet the right way .
'@@ To do good , probably , ' said the Prince , whose eyes were laughing .
'@@ ah ! ' exclaimed the Prince , seeing the Moscow Colonel standing near by , and with a bow to Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l he moved away with his daughter and with the Moscow Colonel , who had joined them .
'@@ That is our arist@@ ocracy , Prince ! ' remarked the Colonel , wishing to appear sar@@ cas@@ tic . he had a pi@@ que against Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l because she did not wish to be acquainted with him .
'@@ Always the same , ' answered the Prince .
'@@ Did you know her before her illness , Prince ? I mean before she was laid up ? '
'@@ Yes , I knew her when she first became an invalid . '
'@@ i hear she has not been up for ten years . '
'@@ Evil tongues say so , my love . but your V@@ aren@@ ka does get it , ' he added .
'@@ Per@@ haps , ' he said , pressing her arm with his el@@ bow . ' but it is better to do good so that , ask whom you will , no one knows anything about it . '
Kit@@ ty was silent , not because she had nothing to say but because she did not want to reveal her secret thoughts even to her father .
there remained only a short @@@ -@@ @ leg@@ ged woman who was always lying down because she had a bad figure , and who tor@@ m@@ ented poor un@@ resisting V@@ aren@@ ka for not t@@ uc@@ king her pl@@ aid the right way .
and by no efforts of imagination could the former Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l be recalled .
the PR@@ IN@@ CE im@@ parted H@@ IS GO@@ OD SP@@ IR@@ ITS to his household , his friends , and even to his German land@@ lord .
the land@@ lord and the servants bri@@ ghtened up under his influence .
they knew his generosity , and in a quarter of an hour the sick Hamburg doctor , who lived up@@ stairs , was looking with envy from his window at the mer@@ ry party of healthy Russians gathered under the ch@@ est@@ nut tree .
at the other end sat the Prince , making a substantial meal and talking loudly and mer@@ r@@ ily .
the Princess laughed at her husband for his Russian ways , but was liveli@@ er and brighter than she had ever been during her stay at the wat@@ ering @@@ -@@ @ place .
the Colonel smiled , as he always did at the Prince 's jokes ; but with regard to Europe ( which he thought he had carefully studied ) he sided with the Princess .
all this che@@ ered Kit@@ ty up , but she could not help being troubled .
she could not solve the problem unconsciously set her by her father 's j@@ oc@@ ular view of her friends and of the life she had begun to love so much .
to this problem was added the change in her relations with the Pet@@ rov@@ s , which had been so clearly and un@@ pleas@@ antly demonstrated that morning .
everybody was mer@@ ry , but Kit@@ ty could not be mer@@ ry , and this troubled her still more .
she felt almost as she used to feel when , as a child , she was locked up in a room for punishment and heard her sister 's mer@@ ry laughter .
'@@ Now , why have you bought that mass of things ? ' asked the Princess , smiling and passing her husband a cup of coffee .
'@@ One goes out walking , comes to a shop , and they ask one to buy something . it 's " Er@@ lau@@ cht , Excell@@ en@@ z , Dur@@ ch@@ lau@@ cht . "
'@@ That 's all because you are bored , ' said the Princess .
'@@ Bo@@ red , of course I am !
'@@ How can you be bored , Prince ?
there is so much that is interesting in Germany now , ' said Mary Ev@@ gen@@ y@@ evna .
but I know all your interesting things : pl@@ um @@@ -@@ @ soup and pe@@ a @@@ -@@ @ s@@ aus@@ ages . I know them .
'@@ no , say what you please , Prince , their institutions are interesting , ' said the Colonel .
they are as self @@@ -@@ @ satisfied as brass far@@ things ; they 've conquered everybody .
now tell me what am I to be pleased about ?
I have not conquered anybody , but here I have to take off my own boots and even put them outside the door myself .
'@@ But " time is money , " don '@@ t forget that , ' said the Colonel .
there are times when one would give a whole month for a sh@@ illing and there are times when you would not give half an hour at any price .
is not that so , Kit@@ ty ?
why are you so gl@@ um ? '
'@@ Where are you off to ?
stay a little longer , ' he said , turning to V@@ aren@@ ka .
she was not worse , but different from what Kit@@ ty previously had imagined her to be .
'@@ Oh dear , I have not laughed so much for a long time ! ' said V@@ aren@@ ka , collecting her sun@@ shade and bag . ' what a dear your Pap@@ a is ! '
'@@ When shall we meet ? ' asked V@@ aren@@ ka .
'@@ M@@ ama was going to call on the Pet@@ rov@@ s .
will you be there ? ' asked Kit@@ ty , trying to sound V@@ aren@@ ka .
'@@ i will , ' answered V@@ aren@@ ka . ' they are preparing to leave , so I have promised to help them pack . '
'@@ Then I 'll come too . '
'@@ Why not , why not , why not ? ' asked Kit@@ ty with wide @@@ -@@ @ open eyes , and holding V@@ aren@@ ka 's sun@@ shade to prevent her going . ' no , wait a bit , and tell me why not . '
'@@ no , no , tell me why you do not wish me to be often at the Pet@@ rov@@ s ?
why ? '
'@@ i have not said so , ' replied V@@ aren@@ ka quietly .
'@@ no , please tell me ! '
'@@ Sh@@ all I tell you everything ? ' said V@@ aren@@ ka .
'@@ There is nothing special to tell , only Pet@@ rov used to want to leave sooner but now does not want to go , ' said V@@ aren@@ ka smiling .
and you know how exc@@ itable such inv@@ ali@@ ds are . '
Kit@@ ty fro@@ w@@ ned yet more , and remained silent , and only V@@ aren@@ ka spoke , trying to soften and soo@@ the Kit@@ ty , and forese@@ eing an approaching explosion of tears or words , she knew not which .
'@@ So it is better for you not to go ...
and , you understand , don '@@ t be hurt ... '
'@@ It serves me right , it serves me right ! ' Kit@@ ty began hur@@ ri@@ edly , s@@ nat@@ ching V@@ aren@@ ka 's sun@@ shade out of her hands , and looking past her friend 's eyes .
V@@ aren@@ ka felt like smiling at her friend 's chil@@ dish anger but feared to offend her .
'@@ It serves me right because it was all pret@@ ence , all invented and not heart@@ felt .
what business had I with a stranger ?
so it comes about that I am the cause of a quarrel , and have been doing what nobody asked me to do .
'@@ But what motive had you for pretending ? ' said V@@ aren@@ ka softly .
'@@ Oh , how stupid , how stupid !
there was no need at all ...
it was all pret@@ ence ! ' Kit@@ ty said , opening and shutting the sun@@ shade .
'@@ But with what object ? '
'@@ To appear better than others to myself and to God - to deceive everybody .
no , I shall not give in to that again !
let me be bad , but at any rate not false , not a hum@@ bug ! '
'@@ But who is a " hum@@ bug " ? ' asked V@@ aren@@ ka repro@@ ach@@ fully . ' you speak as if ... '
but Kit@@ ty was in one of her fits of passion .
she would not let V@@ aren@@ ka finish .
'@@ i am not talking about you , not about you at all .
yes , yes , you are all perfection but how can I help it if I am bad ?
it would not have happened if I were not bad .
so let me be what I am , but not pretend .
what is Anna Pavlov@@ na to me ?
let them live as they like , and I will live as I like .
I C@@ AN@@ NOT be different ...
'@@ But what is not the thing ? ' said V@@ aren@@ ka , quite perpl@@ exed .
I can '@@ t live except by my own heart , but you live by principles .
I have loved you quite simply , but you , I expect , only in order to save me , to teach me . '
'@@ You are unjust , ' said V@@ aren@@ ka .
'@@ But I am not talking about others , only about myself . '
'@@ Kit@@ ty ! ' came her mother 's voice , ' come here and show Pap@@ a your cor@@ als . '
'@@ What 's the matter ?
why are you so red ? ' asked both her mother and father together .
why have I offended her ?
V@@ aren@@ ka , with her hat on , sat at the table examining the spring of her sun@@ shade , which Kit@@ ty had broken .
'@@ V@@ aren@@ ka , forgive me , forgive me ! ' whispered Kit@@ ty , coming close to her . ' I don '@@ t remember what I said . '
'@@ Re@@ ally , I did not wish to distress you , ' said V@@ aren@@ ka with a smile .
peace was made .
but with her father 's return the world in which she had been living completely changed for Kit@@ ty .
but her affection for V@@ aren@@ ka was not weakened .
'@@ i will come when you are married , ' said V@@ aren@@ ka .
'@@ i shall never marry . '
Kit@@ ty returned to Russia quite cured !
she was not as ca@@ reless and light @@@ -@@ @ hearted as before , but she was at peace . her old Moscow sor@@ rows were no more than a memory .
Sergi@@ us IV@@ AN@@ IC@@ H KO@@ Z@@ NY@@ SH@@ E@@ V , wishing to take a rest from mental work , went to stay with his brother in the country instead of going abroad as usual .
according to his views country life was preferable to any other , and he had now come to his brother 's house to enjoy it .
Constan@@ tine Levin was very pleased , especially as he no longer expected his brother Nicholas to come that summer .
but in spite of his affection and respect for Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , Constan@@ tine did not feel at ease with his step @@@ -@@ @ brother in the country .
to Constan@@ tine the country seemed a good place because it was the scene of un@@ question@@ ably useful labour ; to Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev it seemed good because one could and should do nothing there .
besides this , Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev 's attitude toward the peasants jar@@ red on Constan@@ tine .
had Constan@@ tine been asked whether he liked the peasants , he would not have known what to answer .
he both liked and dis@@ liked them , just as he liked and dis@@ liked all human beings .
to say that he knew the peasants was tantamount to saying that he knew human beings .
his methodical mind had formed definite views on the life of the people , founded partly on that life itself , but chiefly on its contrast .
he never altered his opinions about the people nor his sympathetic attitude toward them .
with an elder brother 's con@@ des@@ cension he sometimes explained to him the meaning of things , but could find no pleasure in discussion , because he could gain too easy a victory .
Constan@@ tine considered his brother to be a man of great intellect , noble in the highest sense of the word , and gifted with the power of working for the general welfare .
his most usual and natural listener was his brother ; and therefore , despite their friendly relations , Constan@@ tine felt uncomfortable at leaving him alone .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev loved to lie bas@@ king in the sunshine , talking laz@@ ily .
'@@ You can '@@ t imagine what a pleasure this complete laz@@ iness is to me : not a thought in my brain - you might send a ball rolling through it ! '
'@@ Hav@@ en '@@ t you walked about enough in this heat ? ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev .
'@@ no ; I must just look in at the counting @@@ -@@ @ house for a moment , ' answered Levin , and off he ran to the fields .
at THE beginning OF J@@ UN@@ E Levin 's old nurse and house@@ keeper , Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na , happened to slip as she was carrying to the cellar a jar of mush@@ rooms which she had just pick@@ led , and spra@@ ined her wrist .
after the doctor 's departure Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev felt inclined to go to the river with his fishing rod .
he was fond of ang@@ ling , and seemed proud of being able to like such a stupid occupation .
Constan@@ tine , who was obliged to go to the cor@@ n@@ fields and meadows , offered to give his brother a lift in his trap .
it was the time of that short pause before the labour , yearly renewed , of getting in the harvest , which always demands all the peasants ' strength for its accomplishment .
the promise of the harvest was splendid , the weather clear and hot , and the short night de@@ w@@ y .
the brothers had to pass through the forest on their way to the meadows .
Constan@@ tine Levin did not like talking or hearing about the beauty of nature .
words seemed to de@@ tract from the beauty of what he was looking at .
he ass@@ ented to what his brother said but could not help thinking of other things .
when they emerged from the forest his attention was arrested at the sight of a f@@ allow field and a hil@@ lock , here and there yellow with grass or broken up and cut into squares , in some parts spec@@ k@@ led with he@@ aps of man@@ ure , or even pl@@ ough@@ ed .
Levin counted the car@@ ts , and was pleased to see that sufficient man@@ ure was being brought . at sight of the meadows his thoughts turned to the ha@@ y harvest .
the thought of the ha@@ y harvest always touched him to the quick .
when they reached the me@@ adow Levin stopped .
though Constan@@ tine was lo@@ th to crush his grass , he drove across the me@@ adow .
the tall grass tw@@ ined softly about the wheels and the horse 's legs , leaving seeds on the wet spok@@ es and hubs .
'@@ Have you found it , F@@ om@@ ich ? ' he asked .
'@@ F@@ ound it , indeed , Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich !
day , but you always mo@@ w earlier .
why not , God willing ?
'@@ And what do you think of the weather '
though he had caught nothing , Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev did not feel bored and seemed in the best of spirits .
Levin saw that he had been r@@ oused by his conversation with the doctor and wanted to have a talk .
Levin , on the contrary , was impati@@ ent to get home in order to give orders about hiring the m@@ ow@@ ers on the mor@@ row , and to decide about the ha@@ y harvest , which greatly occupied his mind .
'@@ Well , let 's go , ' said he .
'@@ Where 's the hurry ?
how wet you are !
though nothing b@@ ites , it 's pleasant ; hunting and similar sports are good because they bring one in touch with nature ...
'@@ i don '@@ t know that rid@@ dle , ' replied Levin in a dull tone .
if all the better sort stand aside , of course heaven only knows what will happen .
we expen@@ d money for salaries , but there are no schools , no medical assistance , no mid@@ wives , no chemists , no anything ! '
'@@ You know I have tried , ' Levin replied slowly and reluctantly , ' but I can '@@ t ! so what am I to do ? '
'@@ Why can '@@ t you ?
I confess I don '@@ t understand .
'@@ N@@ either the one nor the other - nor the last .
I have tried and seen that I can do nothing , ' said Levin .
he did not pay much attention to what his brother was saying .
pe@@ ering into the distance across the river , he made out something black in the cor@@ n@@ field , and could not see whether it was only a horse or the ste@@ ward on horse@@ back .
'@@ Why can you do nothing ?
you have made an attempt , and because according to your judgment it was a failure , you gave it up .
fancy having so little ambition ! '
'@@ Am@@ bition ? ' reiterated Levin , stun@@ g by his brother 's words . ' I do not understand it .
'@@ Come now ! after all , ' continued the elder brother with a fro@@ wn on his handsome , intelligent face , ' there are limits to everything !
it is all very well to be a c@@ rank , to be sincere and dislike hypocrisy - I know that very well - but what you are saying has either no meaning at all or a very bad meaning .
how can you consider it un@@ important that the people , whom you love , as you maintain ... '
'@@ i never maintained it , ' thought Levin ...
' ... are dying without help ?
Constan@@ tine felt that there was nothing for him but to submit or else to own to a lack of love for the common cause , and he felt wounded and griev@@ ed .
'@@ Bo@@ th the one and the other , ' said he resolutely . ' I can '@@ t see how it is to be done ... '
'@@ Well , it seems impossible to me ...
besides , I have no faith in medicine generally ... '
'@@ Come now ! that is unjust ...
I could cite thousands of cases to you ...
'@@ Scho@@ ols ? what for ? '
'@@ What do you mean ?
is it possible to doubt the utility of education ?
if it is good for you , why not for everybody ? '
Constan@@ tine felt himself morally cor@@ nered , and in consequence became excited and involun@@ tarily betrayed the chief cause of his indifference to social questions .
this unexpected view of the question took Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev by surprise ; but he immediately formed a new plan of attack .
he remained silent a@@ while , lifted his rod and threw the line again , and then turned to his brother with a smile .
there is need of a medical centre after all .
did we not send for the district doctor for Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na ? '
'@@ But I think her hand will remain cro@@ oked all the same . '
ask anyone you like , ' said Constan@@ tine , deci@@ dedly . ' a peasant who can read and write is far worse as a lab@@ ou@@ rer .
they can '@@ t m@@ end the roads , and when they build a bridge they steal . '
do you admit that education is a good thing for the people ? '
he felt that , since he admitted this much , it would be proved to him that he was talking meaningless tw@@ add@@ le .
how it would be proved to him he did not know ; but he knew that it certainly would be proved logically , and waited for that proof .
the proof turned out to be far simpler than Constan@@ tine anticipated .
'@@ If you admit it to be good , ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , ' then , as an honest man , you C@@ AN@@ NOT help loving and sympath@@ izing with such movements and wishing to work for them . '
'@@ But I am not yet prepared to say that such work is desirable , ' returned Levin .
'@@ i mean I consider it neither desirable nor possible . '
'@@ You can '@@ t tell without having tried it . '
'@@ Well , let 's grant it is so , ' said Levin , though he did not grant it at all . ' still , I don '@@ t see why I should he bothered with it . '
'@@ What do you mean ? '
'@@ i don '@@ t see what philosophy has to do with it , ' replied Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev in a tone that made it seem - at least Levin thought so - that he did not consider his brother had a right to argue on philosophical questions .
this irrit@@ ated Levin .
'@@ This is what it has to do with it , ' he said , getting heated . ' I believe that in any case the motive power of all our actions is our personal happiness .
at present I , a no@@ bl@@ eman , see nothing in our Zem@@ st@@ vo that could con@@ duce to my welfare .
the roads are not better and C@@ AN@@ NOT be made better , and my horses do manage to pull me over the bad ones .
I don '@@ t require doctors and medical centres ; I don '@@ t need the magistr@@ ate ; I never apply to him and never will .
I not only do not require schools , but they would even do me harm , as I have already told you .
'@@ Come , ' smil@@ ingly interrupted Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , ' it was not our personal interest which induced us to work for the emancip@@ ation of the ser@@ fs , and yet we did it . '
'@@ no , no ! ' Constan@@ tine interrupted , growing more and more heated .
but Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev shrugged his shoulders .
'@@ Well , what do you want to prove by that ? '
'@@ And to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row you may be going to law . would you rather be tried in the old Criminal Court ? '
that is the common and philosophical truth , ' said he , emphasizing the word philosophical , as if he wanted to show that he might talk about philosophy as much as anyone else .
'@@ He too has some philosophy or other to serve his in@@ clin@@ ations , ' he thought
but that is not the point . I need only correct your illustration to get at the point .
the bir@@ ches are not stuck in : some of them are planted , and others are s@@ own and have to be tended carefully .
only those peoples have a future , only those peoples can be called historic , that have a sense of what is important and great in their institutions , and value them . '
and to prove the in@@ accuracy of Levin 's views , Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev carried the conversation into the realm of philosophy and history , which was beyond Constan@@ tine 's reach .
but he did not go deeply into these questions , and without repl@@ ying to his brother began reflecting on a totally different and personal matter .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev wound up his last line , unti@@ ed the horse , and they started on their home@@ ward way .
since his brother 's arrival , however , he was in doubt whether to go m@@ owing or not .
he did not feel comfortable at the thought of leaving his brother alone all day long , and he also feared that Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev might laugh at him .
but while walking over the me@@ adow he recalled the impression m@@ owing had made on him , and almost made up his mind to do it .
after his irrit@@ ating conversation with his brother he again remembered his intention .
'@@ i need physical exercise ; without it my character gets quite spo@@ ilt , ' thought he , and determined to go and mo@@ w , however uncomfortable his brother and the peasants might make him feel .
in the evening Constan@@ tine went to the office and gave orders about the work , sending round to the villages to tell the m@@ ow@@ ers to come next day to the Kal@@ ina me@@ adow , the largest and finest he had .
'@@ And please send my sc@@ y@@ the to Tit@@ us to be sharpen@@ ed , and have it taken to the me@@ adow to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row : I may go m@@ owing myself , ' he said , trying to overcome his confusion .
the ste@@ ward smiled and said ,
'@@ the weather looks settled ; to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row we begin m@@ owing . '
'@@ i like that work very much , ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev looked up at his brother in surprise . ' how do you mean ?
all day , just like the peasants ? '
'@@ Yes , it is very pleasant , ' replied Levin .
'@@ It is splendid physical exercise , but you will hardly be able to hold out , ' remarked Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , without the least sar@@ cas@@ m .
'@@ i have tried it .
I don '@@ t think I shall lag behind ... '
but tell me , how do the peasants take it ?
I expect they laugh at their c@@ rank of a master ? '
'@@ But how can you dine with them ?
'@@ no ; I will just come home at their dinner @@@ -@@ @ time . '
next morning Constan@@ tine got up earlier than usual , but giving instructions about the farming delayed him and when he came to the me@@ adow each man was already m@@ owing his second sw@@ ath .
he counted forty @@@ -@@ @ two of them .
they moved slowly along the uneven bottom of the me@@ adow , where a we@@ ir had once been .
Levin dis@@ mounted and , te@@ ther@@ ing his horse by the road@@ side , went up to Tit@@ us , who fetched another sc@@ y@@ the from behind a bush and gave it to Levin .
'@@ It 's ready , master ! like a ra@@ zor , it will mo@@ w of itself , ' said Tit@@ us , taking off his cap and smiling as he handed the sc@@ y@@ the .
the peasants , per@@ spir@@ ing and mer@@ ry , who had finished their sw@@ aths came out on to the road one after another , and laugh@@ ingly exchanged greetings with the master .
'@@ Mind , master ! having put your hand to the pl@@ ough , don '@@ t look back ! ' and Levin heard the sound of repressed laughter among the m@@ ow@@ ers .
'@@ i will try not to lag behind , ' he said , taking his place behind Tit@@ us and waiting his turn to fall in .
'@@ Mind ! ' repeated the old man .
he heard voices behind him :
'@@ You are taking too wide a sw@@ ath , you 'll get knocked up . ' ...
'@@ He 's the master , he must work ; he 's working for himself ' ...
'@@ But look how uneven ! ' ...
they came to softer grass , and Levin , who was listening without repl@@ ying , followed Tit@@ us and tried to mo@@ w as well as possible .
when they had gone some hundred steps Tit@@ us was still going on without pa@@ using , showing no signs of fatigue , while Levin was already beginning to fear he would not be able to keep up , he felt so tired .
but just at that moment Tit@@ us stopped of his own accord , sto@@ op@@ ed , took up some grass and wiped his sc@@ y@@ the with it .
the peasant behind him was still m@@ owing but was obviously tired too , for he stopped without coming even with Levin and began wh@@ et@@ ting his sc@@ y@@ the .
Tit@@ us wh@@ et@@ ted his own and Levin 's , and they began m@@ owing again .
the same thing happened at Levin 's second attempt .
Tit@@ us swung his sc@@ y@@ the , swing after swing , without stopping and without getting tired .
in this way they finished the sw@@ ath .
what gave him most pleasure was the knowledge that he would be able to keep up with the peasants .
the only thing mar@@ ring his joy was the fact that his sw@@ ath was not well m@@ own .
the next sw@@ aths were easier , but still Levin had to work with all his might to keep even with the peasants .
he thought of nothing and desired nothing , except not to lag behind and to do his work as well as possible .
suddenly he was conscious of a pleasant cool@@ ness on his hot per@@ spir@@ ing shoulders , without knowing what it was or wh@@ ence it came .
a dark cloud was hanging low overhead , and large drops of rain were falling .
some of the peasants went to put on their coats ; others as well as Levin felt pleasure in the refreshing rain and merely moved their shoulders up and down .
they went on m@@ owing long and short rows , good and poor grass .
Levin had lost all count of time and had really no idea whether it was late or early .
his work was undergoing a change which gave him intense pleasure .
but as soon as he began thinking about it and trying to work better , he at once felt how hard the task was and m@@ owed badly .
he finished a sw@@ ath and was about to start another when Tit@@ us paused and went up to the old man , and both looked at the sun .
'@@ Breakfast @@@ -@@ @ time , master , ' said the old man .
only then he remembered that he had not been right about the weather and that the rain was wet@@ ting the ha@@ y .
'@@ It won '@@ t hurt , master . " mo@@ w in the rain , r@@ ake when it 's fine ! " -@@ '
Levin unti@@ ed his horse and rode home to his coffee .
by the time Levin had finished breakfast Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev had only just got up , and Levin went back to the me@@ adow before Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev had come to table .
his pleasant young face , with a wis@@ p of grass tied round the forehead over his hair , worked all over with the effort ; but whenever anyone glanced at him he smiled .
evidently he would have died rather than confess that the work was ti@@ ring .
those were happy moments .
it 's good ! ' said he , with a win@@ k .
and really Levin thought he had never t@@ asted any nic@@ er drink than this lu@@ ke@@ warm water with green stuff floating in it and a flav@@ our of the ru@@ sty tin box .
these were blessed moments .
it was trying only when thought became necessary in order to mo@@ w around a mol@@ e@@ hill or a space where the hard sor@@ rel stal@@ ks had not been we@@ eded out .
Levin and the young fellow on the other side of him found such changes of action difficult .
both of them , having got into one strained kind of movement , were in the grip of f@@ ever@@ ish labour and had not the power to change the motion of their bodies and at the same time to observe what lay before them .
had he been asked how long he had been m@@ owing , he would have answered ' half an hour , ' although it was nearly noon .
'@@ Look at the mid@@ ges crawling along ! ' he said , pointing to the children and gl@@ ancing at the sun from under his lifted hand .
'@@ Come , master ! it 's dinner @@@ -@@ @ time , ' said he with decision .
all the m@@ ow@@ ers on reaching the river went across the sw@@ aths to where their coats lay , and where the children who had brought their dinners sat waiting for them .
Levin sat down beside them ; he did not want to go away .
some had a wash . the young lad@@ s bath@@ ed in the river ; others arranged places for their after @@@ -@@ @ dinner rest , un@@ fast@@ ened their bags of bread and un@@ stop@@ pered their ju@@ gs of k@@ vas .
'@@ Come , master , have some of my dinner , ' said he , kne@@ eling in front of his bowl .
he shared the old man 's meal and got into conversation with him about his domestic affairs , taking a lively interest in them and telling him about his own , giving him all the particul@@ ars which would interest the old peasant .
the old man had already been long awake and sat setting the sc@@ y@@ thes for the young men .
Levin looked round and hardly recognized the place , everything was so altered .
a wide expan@@ se of the me@@ adow was already m@@ own , and with its sw@@ aths of grass already giving off perf@@ ume , shone with a peculiar fresh brilli@@ ance in the obli@@ que rays of the descending sun .
an extraordinary amount had been done by the forty @@@ -@@ @ two men .
the larger me@@ adow , which in the days of ser@@ f@@ dom had taken thirty men two days to mo@@ w , was all finished except some short patches at the corners .
but Levin wanted to get as much as possible done that day , and it was v@@ ex@@ ati@@ ous to see the sun already declining .
he was not feeling at all tired and was only longing to work again and to accomplish as much as he could .
'@@ What do you think - could we manage to get Mash@@ kin Heights m@@ own to @@@ -@@ @ day ? ' he asked the old man .
'@@ Now then , lad@@ s ! keep going ! ' said Tit@@ us , starting off ahead almost at a tro@@ t .
'@@ Go on , go on ! ' said the old man , hur@@ rying after him and easily catching him up .
and young and old vi@@ ed with each other at m@@ owing .
but in spite of their ha@@ ste they did not spoil the grass , and the sw@@ aths fell just as evenly and exactly as before .
the sun was already setting toward the trees when , with their tin boxes ratt@@ ling , they entered the woo@@ ded rav@@ ine of the Heights .
the grass that in the middle of the rav@@ ine reached to their wai@@ sts was delicate , soft , and broad @@@ -@@ @ bl@@ aded , spec@@ k@@ led here and there with cow @@@ -@@ @ wheat .
after a short consultation as to whether they should mo@@ w the rav@@ ine across or leng@@ th@@ wise , Pro@@ kh@@ or - a gigantic dark man and a famous m@@ ower - took the lead .
on the short sw@@ aths the m@@ ow@@ ers crowded together , their tin boxes cl@@ attering , their sc@@ y@@ thes ringing whenever they touched , the wh@@ et@@ stones whist@@ ling upon the blades , and their mer@@ ry voices res@@ ounding as they urged each other on .
Levin was again m@@ owing between the old man and the l@@ ad .
the old man , who had put on his she@@ ep@@ skin jacket , was still as j@@ ol@@ ly , wit@@ ty , and easy in his movements as before .
in the wood their sc@@ y@@ thes continually cut down wood mush@@ rooms , grown pl@@ ump amid the ju@@ icy grass .
the old man sto@@ op@@ ed each time he came upon one , picked it up , and put it inside his jacket , saying , ' Another treat for my old woman . '
it was easy to cut the wet soft grass , but on the other hand it was very difficult to go up and down the steep slopes of the rav@@ ine .
Levin followed , and often thought he would certainly fall when climbing a m@@ ound with his sc@@ y@@ the in his hand - a m@@ ound so steep that it would have been hard to climb even un@@ enc@@ um@@ bered .
Levin , having regre@@ tfully taken leave of them , mounted and rode home .
'@@ We have finished the whole of the me@@ adow !
how delightful it is ! wonderful !
and how have you got on ? ' Levin had quite forgotten the unpleasant conversation of the previous day .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev could not bear flies , and opened the windows in his room only at night , keeping the door carefully closed .
'@@ no , not one , I swear .
you would not believe what enjoyment it was !
'@@ Qu@@ ite well .
but have you really been m@@ owing all day ?
you must be as hungry as a wolf .
'@@ no , I don '@@ t want to eat ; I have had something there .
'@@ What rain was that ?
so you have spent the day all right ?
that 's good . ' and Levin went off to dress .
though Levin had imagined that he was not hungry , and sat down to table only not to offend Kuz@@ ma , yet when he began eating he thought everything delicious .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev smiled as he looked at him
'@@ Oh , yes , there 's a letter for you , ' said he . ' Kuz@@ ma , please bring it .
the letter was from O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
Levin read it aloud .
she is in Er@@ g@@ ush@@ evo , and everything is out of gear there .
please go and see her and help her with your advice - you know all about everything .
I will certainly go and see her , ' said Levin .
'@@ i shall be very glad , ' replied Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , still smiling .
'@@ i must say you have an appetite ! ' he said , gl@@ ancing at the sun@@ burnt rud@@ dy face bent over the plate .
you would hardly believe what a remedy it is for every kind of folly .
'@@ You would hardly require it , I should say . '
'@@ Yes , it ought to be tested .
you know , I thought of coming to the me@@ adow to have a look at you , but it was so un@@ bear@@ ably hot that I got only as far as the forest !
'@@ P@@ ossi@@ bly ; but it is a pleasure such as I have never in my life experienced before , and there is nothing wrong in it .
'@@ If they don '@@ t like it , it can '@@ t be helped .
besides , I think it 's all right .
'@@ i see that on the whole you are well satisfied with your day . '
'@@ Very well indeed !
we finished the me@@ adow .
and I ch@@ um@@ med up with such a fine old man !
you can '@@ t imagine what a charming fellow he is . '
I 'll show it you .
and afterwards I thought over our yesterday 's conversation . '
'@@ What about yesterday 's conversation ? ' asked Levin , who had finished dinner and sat blis@@ s@@ fully bl@@ inking and pu@@ ffing , quite unable to remember what yesterday 's conversation had been about .
'@@ i think you are partly right .
our disagreement lies in the fact that you consider personal interests the motive power , while I think every man with a certain degree of education ought to be interested in the general welfare .
Levin listened to his brother but understood absolutely nothing and did not wish to understand .
he was only afraid his brother might put some question which would el@@ icit the fact that he was not paying attention .
'@@ That 's what it is , old cha@@ p , ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , pat@@ ting Constan@@ tine 's shoulder .
'@@ Yes , of course !
I don '@@ t insist on my view , ' replied Levin , with a guilty , child@@ like smile .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev smiled too . ' shall we go for a stroll together ? ' he said , not wishing to part from his brother , who seemed to be ex@@ hal@@ ing fresh@@ ness and vig@@ our . ' come along ! we could call in at the office if you want to . '
'@@ Oh , dear me ! ' exclaimed Levin , so loudly that he scared Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev .
'@@ What 's the matter ? '
'@@ How 's Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na 's arm ? ' asked Levin , sl@@ apping his head . ' I had forgotten all about it . '
'@@ Well , I 'll run and see her , all the same .
and his heels cl@@ attered swiftly down the stairs , making a noise like a r@@ attle .
some twenty years before , when Dol@@ ly was still a child , that house had seemed ro@@ omy and convenient , though in common with all houses of the kind it stood away from the drive and had not a south aspect .
it was old and beginning to decay .
in the spring , when O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky went there to sell the forest , Dol@@ ly had asked him to look over the house and have all necessary repairs done .
like all guilty husbands O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky was very anxious about his wife 's comfort , so he looked over the house himself and gave orders to have everything done that seemed to him necessary .
try as he would to be a consider@@ ate husband and father , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky never could remember that he had a wife and children .
he had the tastes of a bachelor and understood no others .
when he returned to Moscow he informed his wife that all was being prepared , that the house would look like a new toy , and advised her to move thi@@ ther .
her departure for the country suited O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky in every way : it was good for the children , expenses would be cut down , and he would be freer .
Kit@@ ty wrote from her wat@@ ering @@@ -@@ @ place that nothing seemed so attractive as spending the summer with Dol@@ ly at Er@@ g@@ ush@@ evo , which was full of childhood 's memories for both of them .
the first days in the country were very trying for Dol@@ ly .
but when she came there as mistress of the house she saw that things were quite different from what she had expected .
the day after her arrival it poured with rain and in the night the rain came through into the passage and nur@@ sery , so that the children 's beds had to be carried into the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room .
there were no eggs .
no peasant women could be got to sc@@ rub the floors : they were all out planting potatoes .
there was nowhere to hang dresses , because what few wardro@@ bes there were would not shut , or else opened of themselves when anyone passed by .
there was no man@@ gle in the laundry , not even an ironing board , and no large pots or p@@ ans .
the position seemed ir@@ remedi@@ able ; but just as in other households , there was here in the O@@ bl@@ on@@ sk@@ ys ' house one in@@ conspicuous yet most important and useful person : Mat@@ ren@@ a Fil@@ im@@ on@@ ovna .
she consol@@ ed her mistress , assuring her that everything would ' shape itself ( this phrase was her own , and Matthew had learnt it from her ) , and she went to work deliberately and without excitement .
she at once made friends with the ste@@ ward 's wife , and on the very day of the removal drank tea with her and with the ste@@ ward beneath the lab@@ ur@@ num@@ s , discussing arrangements .
'@@ There , you see ! and you were quite in despair ! ' said Mat@@ ren@@ a Fil@@ im@@ on@@ ovna , pointing to the board .
L@@ ily started bathing , and at least part of Dol@@ ly 's expectations were fulfilled , if not that of a quiet , at least that of a comfortable , country life .
very , very rare were the short intervals of quiet .
but these cares and anxi@@ eties were the only kind of happiness possible for Dol@@ ly .
had it not been for them she would have been left to her thoughts about the husband who did not love her .
now in the country sol@@ itude she grew more often aware of these jo@@ ys .
at THE EN@@ D OF MA@@ Y , when the house was more or less in order , Dol@@ ly received from her husband an answer to her letter of complaint .
he wrote asking her to forgive his not having seen to everything , and saying that he would come as soon as possible .
on the Sunday before St Peter 's Day Dol@@ ly took all her children to Comm@@ union .
she had a strange religion of her own , firmly believing in the trans@@ migration of souls , and not caring about Church dog@@ mas .
several days previously she decided how all the children should be dressed .
new fro@@ cks were made , old ones altered , h@@ ems and fr@@ ills let down , buttons se@@ wn on , and rib@@ bons got ready .
one of the fro@@ cks , which the English govern@@ ess had undertaken to alter , was the cause of much bad blood .
the govern@@ ess put the bod@@ ice dar@@ ts in the wrong places , cut out the arm @@@ -@@ @ holes too big , and nearly spo@@ ilt the dress .
the fro@@ ck was put right but it very nearly caused a quarrel with the govern@@ ess .
Dol@@ ly , somewhat excited , had dressed and done her hair with care .
she was not dressing for her own sake , not for her own beauty , but in order , as the mother of all those charming children , not to spoil the general effect .
she gave her mirror a last glance and was satisfied with herself .
she looked well : not in the way she had wished to look when going to a ball , but well for the object she had in view at present .
there was no one in church except peasants , in@@ n@@ keepers and their w@@ omen@@ folk ; but Dol@@ ly saw , or thought she saw , the rap@@ ture produced in them by her children and herself .
the children were not only beautiful in their fine clothes but were also very sweet in their behaviour .
it 's true Al@@ es@@ ha did not stand very well : he kept turning round to see the back of his jacket ; but nevertheless he was wonder@@ fully sweet .
little L@@ ily was charming in her naive wonder at everything around , and it was difficult to re@@ press a smile when , having swallowed the bread and wine , she said in English , ' More , please ! '
on the way home the children were very quiet , feeling that something solemn had taken place .
at home also all went well , only at lunch G@@ ris@@ ha began whist@@ ling and - what was still worse - would not obey the govern@@ ess and had to go without his p@@ ud@@ ding .
Dol@@ ly would not have sanctioned any punishment on such a day had she been present , but she was obliged to support the govern@@ ess and so confirmed the sentence that G@@ ris@@ ha was not to have p@@ ud@@ ding .
this rather spo@@ ilt the general joy@@ fulness .
this was too sad , and Dol@@ ly decided to speak to the govern@@ ess and get her to forgive G@@ ris@@ ha , and went off to find her .
but as she was passing through the dancing @@@ -@@ @ room she saw a scene which filled her heart with such joy that tears came to her eyes and she par@@ d@@ oned the little cul@@ pri@@ t herself .
on the ple@@ a of giving her dolls some dinner she had obtained leave from the govern@@ ess to take her plat@@ eful of p@@ ud@@ ding to the nur@@ sery , but had brought it to her brother instead .
still crying over the injustice done him , he ate the p@@ ud@@ ding , mut@@ tering between so@@ bs : ' eat some yourself ... let us both eat ... together ! '
T@@ anya , affected first by pity for G@@ ris@@ ha and then by the consciousness of her own virtuous action , also had tears in her eyes , but did not decline to eat her share of the p@@ ud@@ ding .
your nice white fro@@ ck !
G@@ ris@@ ha ! ' cried their mother , trying to save the fro@@ ck , but smiling a blis@@ s@@ ful , rap@@ tur@@ ous smile .
the sound of rap@@ tur@@ ous sque@@ aling filled the nur@@ sery , and did not cease till they started on their drive .
they gathered a bas@@ ket@@ ful of mush@@ rooms ; even L@@ ily found one .
previously Miss H@@ ull used to find one and point it out to her ; but this time L@@ ily herself found a fine big one and there was a general shout of delight : ' L@@ ily has found a mush@@ room ! '
when half the children were dressed again , some smar@@ tly @@@ -@@ @ dressed peasant women who had been gathering herbs came up and halted sh@@ y@@ ly by the bathing @@@ -@@ @ house .
Mat@@ ren@@ a Fil@@ im@@ on@@ ovna called to one of these to ask her to dry a bath @@@ -@@ @ sheet and a chem@@ ise that had fallen into the water , and Dol@@ ly entered into conversation with them .
the peasant women , who had begun by laughing behind their hands without compreh@@ ending her questions , soon became b@@ older and more tal@@ k@@ ative , and at once cap@@ tiv@@ ated Dol@@ ly by their frank admiration of her children .
'@@ Just look at the little beauty , as white as sugar ! ' said one , gaz@@ ing admir@@ ingly at T@@ anya and stro@@ king her head . ' but she 's thin . '
'@@ no , she is only three months old , ' Dol@@ ly answered proudly .
'@@ Dear me ! '
'@@ And have you any children ? '
'@@ i had four ; two are left , a boy and a girl .
I we@@ an@@ ed her in the spring . '
'@@ How old is she ? '
'@@ Why did you nurse her so long ? '
'@@ It 's our custom . '
and the conversation turned upon the topic that interested Dol@@ ly more than any other : confin@@ ements , children 's illnesses , husbands ' whereabouts , and whether they came home often .
Dol@@ ly did not want to part from the peasant women ; their conversation pleased her so much because their interests were exactly similar to hers .
the women am@@ used her and offended the English govern@@ ess , who noticed that she was the object of their laughter , which she did not understand .
she was always glad to see him , but on this day was more pleased than ever because he would now see her in all her glory .
no one could understand the dignity of her position better than Levin .
on seeing her he found himself confronted by just such a picture of family life as his fancy painted .
'@@ You 're glad , yet you never sent me word .
my brother is staying with me .
'@@ From Stephen ? ' asked Dol@@ ly in a surprised tone .
he was confused because he imagined that Dol@@ ly might not like to accept the help of a stranger in matters that ought to be attended to by her husband .
she really did not like the way O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky had of forcing his family affairs upon strangers , and knew at once that Levin understood this .
it was for his quick perception and del@@ icacy of feeling that Dol@@ ly liked him .
'@@ of course I understood that this only meant you wanted to see me , and was very pleased .
I can well imagine how strange everything here must seem to you , used as you are to managing a town house ; and if you require anything I am quite at your disposal . '
she knew him , knew that he would be a good match for the young lady , and hoped the affair would come off .
'@@ no , I will walk .
children , who will race the horses with me ? '
whatever Levin 's defects may have been , there was not a trace of pret@@ ence about him ; therefore the children ev@@ inc@@ ed toward him the same friend@@ liness that they saw in their mother 's face .
the two el@@ dest , responding to his invitation , at once jumped out to him and ran with him as they would have done with their nurse , Miss H@@ ull , or their mother .
L@@ ily wanted to go too , and her mother handed her to him ; he put her on his shoulder and ran on .
'@@ Don '@@ t be afraid ! Don '@@ t be afraid , Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na ! there 's no fear of my hurting or dropping her , ' said he , smiling brightly at the mother .
and as she looked at his easy , strong , consider@@ ate , careful and ultra @@@ -@@ @ cautious movements , the mother lost her fears and looked at them with a smile of approval .
he ran about with the children , taught them gymnastics , am@@ used Miss H@@ ull by his broken English and talked to Dol@@ ly about his rural occupations .
'@@ Re@@ ally ? ' said he , fl@@ ushing up ; and to change the subject he at once added : ' well , then , shall I send you two cows ?
if you insist on squ@@ aring accounts , pay me five roubles a month , if your conscience allows it . '
'@@ no , thank you .
'@@ Well , then , I will just have a look at your cows and , with your permission , will give directions about the feeding .
to change the conversation Levin went on to explain to Dol@@ ly a theory of dairy farming which maintained that a cow was only a machine for the transformation of fodder into milk , and so on .
while saying all that , he was passi@@ on@@ ately longing and yet d@@ reading to hear every particular concerning Kit@@ ty .
he feared that the peace of mind he had acquired with so much effort might be destroyed .
'@@ Yes , but all that has to be looked after , and who is going to do it ? ' remarked Dol@@ ly un@@ willingly .
having with Mat@@ ren@@ a Fil@@ im@@ on@@ ovna 's help got her household into working order , she did not care to make any change ; besides , she had no confidence in Levin 's knowledge of farming .
arguments about cows being milk @@@ -@@ @ producing machines did not comm@@ end themselves to her , for she imagined that such arguments were calculated only to interfere with farming .
that was clear .
but arguments about cere@@ al and grass feeding were questionable and vague and , above all , she was anxious to talk about Kit@@ ty .
'@@ And her health ! is she better ? ' asked Levin anxi@@ ously .
'@@ Yes , thank God ! she has quite recovered .
I never believed that she had lung trouble . '
'@@ Oh , I am so glad ! ' said Levin , and Dol@@ ly thought she saw something pathetic and helpless in his face as he said it , and then silently looked at her .
'@@ Tell me , Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich , ' said Dol@@ ly with her kind though slightly ir@@ on@@ ical smile , ' why are you angry with Kit@@ ty ? '
I am not angry , ' said Levin .
'@@ Yes , you are .
why did you not call either on us or on them when you were in Moscow ? '
'@@ Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na , ' said he , bl@@ ushing to the roots of his hair , ' I am surprised that one so kind as you are should not feel what the reason was .
how is it that you have no pity for me , knowing as you do ... '
'@@ You know I proposed and was rejected , ' mut@@ tered Levin , and the ten@@ derness he had a moment ago felt for Kit@@ ty was changed into a feeling of anger at the insult .
'@@ Why did you think I knew ? '
'@@ Because everybody knows it . '
'@@ in that , at any rate , you are mistaken ; I did not know it , though I had my suspicions . '
'@@ Well , any@@ how you know it now . '
'@@ all I knew was that something had happened that tor@@ m@@ ented her dread@@ fully , and she asked me never to speak about it .
well , what did happen between you ?
'@@ i have told you what happened . '
'@@ When I last visited you . '
'@@ Do you know , ' said Dol@@ ly , ' I am terribly , terribly sorry for her !
you are suffering only through pride ... '
'@@ That may be , ' said Levin , ' but ... '
now I understand everything . '
'@@ Well , Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na , please excuse me ! ' he said rising .
'@@ no , wait a bit , ' she answered , holding him by the sleeve . ' wait a bit . sit down . '
'@@ Please , please don '@@ t let us talk about it ! ' said he , sitting down again , conscious as he did so that a hope which he had thought dead and buried was waking and stirring within him .
'@@ If I did not care for you , ' Dol@@ ly went on , the tears rising to her eyes , ' if I did not know you as well as I do ... '
the feeling that seemed dead was coming to life again , rising and taking possession of Levin 's heart .
'@@ Yes , now I understand it all , ' continued Dol@@ ly . ' you can '@@ t understand it , you men who are free and have the choice .
'@@ Well , it 's not quite like that . '
'@@ Never mind ! you propose when your love is ripe or when the balance falls in favour of one of those between whom your choice lies .
but a girl is not asked .
she is expected to choose for herself , yet she has no choice ; she can only say " Yes " or " No . " -@@ '
'@@ Yes , a choice between me and V@@ ron@@ sky , ' thought Levin , and the dead hope that had begun to revive in his soul died again and only weighed painfully on his heart .
'@@ Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na , ' said he , ' in that way one may choose a dress , or ... purchases ... anything ... but not love .
the choice is made , and so much the better ... a repetition is impossible . '
she had said , ' No , it C@@ AN@@ NOT be . '
'@@ Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na , ' he replied dr@@ ily , ' I value your confidence in me , but think you are mistaken .
whether I am right or wrong , that pride which you so desp@@ ise makes any thought of your sister impossible for me - do you understand me ? - perfectly impossible . '
'@@ i will only add just this : you understand that I am speaking about my sister , whom I love as much as my own children .
I do not say she loves you ; I only wished to tell you that her refusal proves nothing . '
'@@ i don '@@ t know ! ' said Levin , jumping up . ' if you know how you hurt me !
of course I will not avoid her , but whenever I can I will try to save her the un@@ pleas@@ ant@@ ness of meeting me . '
'@@ i am speaking French , and you must answer in French . '
the little girl had forgotten the French for sp@@ ade , so her mother told her and went on to say , still in French , where she would find the sp@@ ade .
all this was dis@@ agre@@ eable to Levin .
nothing in Dol@@ ly 's house , or about her children seemed half as charming as before .
'@@ Why does she talk French with the children ? ' he thought . ' how un@@ natural and false it is !
and the children feel it .
'@@ Where are you hur@@ rying to ?
so Levin stayed to tea , though his bright spirits had quite vanished and he felt ill at ease .
after tea he went out to tell his co@@ ach@@ man to harness and when he returned he found Dol@@ ly excited , a worried look on her face and tears in her eyes .
in Levin 's absence an event took place which suddenly put an end to the joy and pride that Dol@@ ly had been feeling all day .
G@@ ris@@ ha and T@@ anya had a fight about a ball .
Dol@@ ly , hearing their scre@@ ams , ran up to the nur@@ sery and found them in a dreadful state .
T@@ anya was holding G@@ ris@@ ha by the hair , and he , his face distorted with anger , was hitting her at random with his fi@@ sts .
she could think and speak of nothing else , and yet could not tell Levin her trouble .
in THE MID@@ D@@ LE OF J@@ UL@@ Y the Elder from the village belonging to Levin 's sister ( which lay fifteen miles from Pok@@ rovsk ) came to see Levin and report on business matters and on the ha@@ y @@@ -@@ @ harvest .
when Levin took over the management of the estate he looked into the matter , and , concluding that the grass was worth more , fixed the price at eight roubles .
the peasants would not pay so much , and Levin suspected them of keeping other buyers off .
the local men opposed this innovation by all the means in their power , but the plan succeeded , and in the first year the meadows brought in almost double .
the next and third years the peasants still held out and the harvest was got in by the same means .
there were only thirty @@@ -@@ @ two loads in the stack .
after lengthy disputes it was settled that the peasants themselves should take those eleven st@@ acks , counting them at fifty loads each and that the owner 's share should be measured af@@ resh .
men with ha@@ y@@ for@@ ks followed the women , and the ri@@ dges grew into tall , wide and light ha@@ y@@ c@@ ocks .
to the left , car@@ ts ratt@@ led along the bare me@@ adow , and one after another the ha@@ y@@ c@@ ocks vanished , picked up in enormous for@@ k@@ ful@@ s , and their places were taken by heavy car@@ ts with their huge loads of s@@ cent@@ ed ha@@ y over@@ hanging the horses ' backs .
'@@ Make ha@@ y while the sun shines , and you 'll have plenty , ' remarked the old be@@ e@@ keeper , sitting down beside Levin . ' it 's more like tea than ha@@ y !
is that the last ? ' he shouted to a l@@ ad who was driving past , standing on the front of a cart and fl@@ icking the ends of his h@@ emp@@ en re@@ ins .
'@@ My youngest , ' replied the old man with a smile of affection .
'a fine fellow ! '
'@@ Yes , just over two years . '
'@@ Have they any children ? '
all the first year he did@@ n '@@ t understand anything ; and we cha@@ ffed him , ' answered the old man .
Levin looked more attentively at Van@@ ka Par@@ men@@ ich and his wife .
Van@@ ka stood inside the cart pat@@ ting and stam@@ ping down evenly in the cart the enormous bal@@ es of ha@@ y which his young wife first passed to him in arm@@ ful@@ s and then pit@@ ched up on the for@@ k .
the young woman was working with ease , cheer@@ fulness and skill .
Van@@ ka , with evident desire to save her every moment of unnecessary exer@@ tion , hur@@ ri@@ edly caught the ha@@ y in his out@@ spread arms and smoo@@ thed it evenly in the cart .
Van@@ ka showed her how to do this , and burst out laughing at something she said .
strong , young , newly @@@ -@@ @ awakened love shone in both their faces .
having come out upon the road , Van@@ ka took his place in the line of car@@ ts .
the women , carrying their r@@ akes over their shoulders , followed the car@@ ts , their coloured dresses gle@@ aming brightly and their chat@@ ter ringing mer@@ r@@ ily .
the singing women were drawing nearer to Levin and he felt as if a thunder@@ cloud of mer@@ ri@@ ment were approaching .
Levin envi@@ ed them their healthy g@@ ai@@ ety and felt a wish to take part in that expression of the joy of living ; but he could do nothing except lie and look and listen .
when the company and their songs vanished out of sight and hearing , an oppressive feeling of discontent with his own lonely lot , his physical id@@ l@@ eness and his hostility to the world over@@ came Levin .
all had been drowned in the sea of their joyful common to@@ il .
the old man who had been sitting beside him had long since gone home .
Levin , unnoticed by them , still lay on the ha@@ y@@ cock , looking , listening , and thinking .
the peasants who were staying in the me@@ adow kept awake almost all the short summer night .
the whole long day of to@@ il had left upon them no trace of anything but mer@@ ri@@ ment .
the sounds of night - the ceas@@ eless cro@@ aking of fro@@ gs , the s@@ nor@@ ting of horses through the morning mist over the me@@ adow - could alone be heard .
aw@@ aking to reality Levin rose from his ha@@ y@@ cock , and gl@@ ancing up at the stars realized that the night was nearly over .
'@@ Well , then , what shall I do ?
how shall I do it ? ' he asked himself , trying to find expression for what he had been thinking and the feelings he had lived through in that short night .
all his ideas and feelings separated themselves into three different lines of thought .
the first was how to renounce his old life and discard his quite useless education .
this ren@@ unciation would afford him pleasure and was quite easy and simple .
the second was concerned with his notion of the life he now wished to lead .
he was distinctly conscious of the simplicity , purity , and ri@@ ghtness of that life , and was convinced that in it he would find satisfaction , peace , and dignity , the absence of which was so painful to him .
but the third thought was the question of how to make the change from his present life to that other one .
and here no clear idea presented itself to his mind .
should he have a wife ?
one thing is certain : this night has decided my fate .
all my former dreams of a family life were nonsense - not the right thing . everything is much simpler and better than that ... '
and how did this shell get formed so quickly ?
a little while ago when I looked at the sky all was clear , but for two white strips .
my views of life have changed in just the same un@@ noticeable way . '
leaving the me@@ adow , he went down the high road toward the village .
a slight breeze was blowing and all looked grey and dull .
at a distance of forty p@@ aces along the road on which he was walking he saw a coach with four horses ab@@ re@@ ast and luggage on top approaching him .
the horses were pressing close together away from the ru@@ ts , but the sk@@ il@@ ful driver , sitting side@@ ways on the box , guided them so that the coach wheels ran smoothly in the ru@@ ts .
that was all Levin noticed , and without wondering who might be inside he glanced in at the window absent @@@ -@@ @ min@@ dedly .
in one corner an elderly woman was do@@ zing ; and close to the window sat a young girl who had just w@@ ak@@ ened and was holding the rib@@ bons of her white night@@ cap with both hands .
bright and thoughtful , full of that complicated refin@@ ement of a life to which Levin was a stranger , she looked across him at the glow of dawn .
at the very moment when this vision was about to disappear , her can@@ did eyes fell on him .
she recognized him and joyful surprise lit up her face .
he could not be mistaken .
there were no other eyes in the world like them .
in the whole world there was only one being able to unite in itself the universe and the meaning of life for him .
it was Kit@@ ty .
he guessed that she was on her way from the station to her sister 's house at Er@@ g@@ ush@@ evo .
all that had so disturbed Levin during the sle@@ e@@ pless night and all his resolutions vanished suddenly .
he recalled with dis@@ gust his thoughts of mar@@ rying a peasant girl .
there alone , inside that coach on the other side of the road , so rapidly rec@@ eding from him , was the one possible solution of that rid@@ dle which had been weighing on him so painfully of late .
the bar@@ king of dogs proved that the coach was passing through the village , and only the empty fields , the village before him , and he himself walking solitary on the deserted road , were left .
'@@ no , ' said he to himself . ' beautiful as is that life of simplicity and to@@ il , I C@@ AN@@ NOT turn to it .
I love her ! '
none B@@ UT TH@@ O@@ SE WHO K@@ NE@@ W K@@ aren@@ in most intim@@ ately knew that this apparently cold and sober @@@ -@@ @ minded man had one weakness , quite inconsistent with the general trend of his character .
K@@ aren@@ in could not with equ@@ anim@@ ity hear or see a child or a woman we@@ eping .
the sight of tears upset him and made him quite incapable of reasoning .
'@@ He will get angry and won '@@ t listen to you , ' they said ; and in such cases the mental per@@ turb@@ ation which tears produced in K@@ aren@@ in really found expression in hur@@ ried bursts of anger .
'@@ i can do nothing for you .
kindly go away ! ' he would shout on these occasions .
that was the cause of the strange De@@ ath@@ like look on his face which had so struck Anna .
his wife 's words , confirming as they did his worst suspicions , had given K@@ aren@@ in a cruel pain in his heart .
this pain was rendered more acute by physical pity for her , ev@@ oked by her tears .
what K@@ aren@@ in experienced was a feeling of this kind : it had been a strange and terrible pain , but it was past , and he felt he could again live , and think of other things beside his wife .
'@@ Without honour , without heart , without religion ; a de@@ pra@@ ved woman !
I knew it and could see it all along , though I tried out of pity for her to deceive myself , ' thought he .
'@@ i made a mistake when I bound up my life with hers , but in my mistake there was nothing bl@@ ame@@ worthy , therefore I ought not to be unhappy .
what would happen to her and to her son , toward whom his feelings had changed as they had toward her , no longer occupied his mind .
yes , even D@@ ram - that honest , business @@@ -@@ @ like fellow ...
'@@ It is a mis@@ fortune that may be@@ fall anyone and it has be@@ fallen me .
the only question is , how best to face the situation . '
and he began mentally reviewing the courses pursued by other men in similar positions .
'@@ Dar@@ y@@ alov fought a du@@ el ... '
in his youth K@@ aren@@ in had been particularly attracted by the idea of du@@ elling , just because he was physically a tim@@ id man and was quite aware of it .
he could not think without horror of a pistol being lev@@ elled at him and had never used any kind of weapon .
nevertheless , I shall have to decide what to do with her .
then I , an innocent man , should be the victim .
and this is not all . a challenge from me would not be an honest action .
do I not know beforehand that my friends would never allow me to go so far as to fight a du@@ el , would not allow a statesman whom Russia needs to expose himself to danger ?
this would happen : I , knowing beforehand that matters would never be allowed to reach a dangerous point , should have challenged a man in order to cover myself with false glam@@ our .
no ! a du@@ el is unthinkable and no one expects it of me .
my aim is to safeguard my reputation , which I need for the uninterrupted pursuit of my career . '
his official pursu@@ its , which had always appeared essential to K@@ aren@@ in , now assumed even greater importance .
having considered and rejected the idea of a du@@ el , K@@ aren@@ in turned his thoughts to divorce , the next expedient of which some of the wrong@@ ed husbands he remembered had avail@@ ed themselves .
in all these cases the husband had c@@ eded or sold the un@@ faithful wife , and the very person who according to law had no right to re @@@ -@@ @ marry entered into fic@@ ti@@ tious , pseudo @@@ -@@ @ legal relations with a pre@@ tended husband .
K@@ aren@@ in saw that in his own case it would be impossible to obtain a legal divorce - that is , a divorce in which the guilty wife would be simply cast off .
to attempt a divorce could only lead to a lawsuit and a scandal which would give his enemies great opportunity for cal@@ um@@ ny , and would lower his high position in Society .
besides , it was evident that as a consequence of divorce the wife would break off relations with her husband and unite with her lover .
'@@ no , it is impossible , impossible ! ' he said aloud , again wrap@@ ping the rug round his legs , ' I C@@ AN@@ NOT be unhappy , but she and he must not be happy . '
the jealousy that had tor@@ m@@ ented him during the period of uncertainty had left him when his wife 's words had with great pain drawn that aching tooth .
but another feeling had now taken the place of the jealousy : it was a wish that his wife 's guilt should meet with re@@ tribution .
he did not acknowledge it to himself , but in the depths of his soul he wished her to suffer for im@@ pairing his peace of mind and his honour .
proceeding to consider further details , K@@ aren@@ in could not even see why his relations with his wife should not remain almost the same as before .
she must be unhappy , but I am not guilty and therefore I C@@ AN@@ NOT suffer . '
by THE T@@ IME H@@ E reached PE@@ TER@@ SB@@ UR@@ G K@@ aren@@ in had not only resolved to keep to his decision , but had mentally composed a letter to his wife .
on entering the hall of his house he glanced at the letters and papers which had been sent from the Ministry and ordered them to be brought into his study .
'@@ Tell him to un@@ harness ; and no one is to be admitted , ' he said in answer to the hall @@@ -@@ @ porter 's inquiry , accent@@ u@@ ating with a certain pleasure the word admitted . it was a sign that he was in good spirits .
he paced twice up and down his study and then halted at the gigantic writing @@@ -@@ @ table , on which his val@@ et had already lit six candles . cracking his fingers , he sat down and arranged his writing materials .
with his el@@ bow on the table and his head bent to one side he sat and thought for a minute , and then wrote without an instant 's pause .
he did not begin by addressing her , and wrote in French , using the pl@@ ural pron@@ ou@@ n you , which in French does not sound as cold and distant as it does in Russian .
'@@ During our last conversation I expressed my intention of communicating my decision with reference to the subject of that conversation .
having carefully and fully considered everything , I now write to fulfil my promise .
my decision is as follows : whatever your actions may have been , I do not consider myself justified in sever@@ ing the bonds with which a Higher Power has united us .
a family must not be broken up through the cap@@ rice , per@@ versity , or even crime , of one of the married couple , and our life must go on as her@@ et@@ o@@ fore .
this is unavoidable for my sake , for yours , and for that of our son .
if not , you can yourself foresee what awaits you and your son .
as the summer season is drawing to a close , I would ask you to return to Petersburg as soon as possible , and not later than Tuesday .
all necessary preparations shall be made for your return .
I beg you to note that I attach importance to this request of mine .
'@@ P.@@ S. - I enc@@ lose some money , which you may need for your expenses . '
he read the letter over and was satisfied with it , especially with having remembered to enc@@ lose the money ; there was not a single cruel word or threat in it , yet it was not yielding in tone .
above all it provided a golden bridge for her to return by .
'@@ Yes , your Excell@@ ency ! shall tea be served in the study ? '
K@@ aren@@ in ass@@ ented , and , to@@ ying with his paper @@@ -@@ @ knife , went to his arm @@@ -@@ @ chair , beside which a lamp was burning and a French book about the E@@ ug@@ ub@@ ine T@@ ables was lying ready .
above the arm @@@ -@@ @ chair hung a beautifully painted portrait of Anna by a celebrated artist .
after looking at the portrait for about a minute he sh@@ ud@@ dered and his lips trem@@ bled and made a sound like ' br@@ r ' as he turned away .
he sat down hur@@ ri@@ edly and opened his book .
he tried to read but could not awaken in himself the lively interest he had felt for the E@@ ug@@ ub@@ ine T@@ ables .
he was not thinking of his wife but of a compl@@ ication that had recently arisen in his official activity and at present constituted the chief interest of his work .
as soon as the foot@@ man , who had brought in the tea , had left the room , K@@ aren@@ in rose and went to the writing @@@ -@@ @ table .
K@@ aren@@ in knew that this was really so .
a great deal of money had been and was being spent quite un@@ produc@@ tively on that business , and it was evident that the scheme would lead to nothing .
like all such matters it went on of itself , by inertia .
( many people lived by it , especially one very moral and musical family in which the daughters all played str@@ ing@@ ed instruments .
K@@ aren@@ in was acquainted with that family and gave away one of the daughters at her marriage . )
the raising of this question by a hostile Department was , in K@@ aren@@ in 's opinion , dishonest , because in every Ministry there were still gra@@ ver matters which , out of recognized official dec@@ ency , no one ever questioned .
the case of the subject races had been accidentally raised at the Committee of 2nd June and had been energe@@ tically insisted on by K@@ aren@@ in , as a matter of urgency in view of their w@@ ret@@ ched condition .
at the Committee this question had caused conflict between several Ministries .
a flush of animation suff@@ used K@@ aren@@ in 's face as he rapidly wrote out a summary of these ideas .
after walking up and down the room he again looked at the portrait , fro@@ w@@ ned , and smiled cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ously .
on her way back from the races , in a moment of excitement in spite of the pain it caused her - she had told her husband everything , and she was glad she had done so .
after he left her , she told herself that she was glad she had told him , that now everything would be definite - at any rate , the false@@ hood and deception would no longer exist .
she thought it quite certain that her position would be cleared up for good .
her new position might be a bad one but it would be definite , and there would be no vagu@@ eness or false@@ hood .
the pain she had inflicted on herself and her husband would now , she thought , be compensated for by the fact that the matter would be settled .
she saw V@@ ron@@ sky that same evening , but did not tell him what had passed between her and her husband , though he would have to be told before her position could be settled .
but the words had been spoken and K@@ aren@@ in had gone away without saying anything .
and in answer to this question a hot bl@@ ush of shame spread all over her face .
she knew what had stopped her , knew she had been ashamed .
the situation which the night before had appeared to be clearing up now seemed quite hopeless .
when she thought of what her husband would do , the most terrible fan@@ cies came into her head .
she f@@ anci@@ ed that presently the ste@@ ward would come and turn her out of the house and that her dis@@ grace would be proclaimed to all the world .
when she thought about V@@ ron@@ sky , she imagined that he did not love her , that he was beginning to find her a burden , and that she could not offer herself to him ; and in consequence she felt hostile toward him .
she felt as if the words she had used to her husband , which she kept repeating in imagination , had been said by her to every one and that every one had heard them .
she had not the courage to look into the eyes of the people she lived with .
Anna looked inqu@@ ir@@ ingly into her eyes and bl@@ ushed with alarm .
the maid beg@@ ged pardon and said she thought she had heard the bell .
she brought a dress and a note .
the note was from Bet@@ sy , who reminded her that she ( Bet@@ sy ) was that day expecting Lisa Mer@@ kal@@ ova and the Bar@@ on@@ ess Stol@@ z , with their admir@@ ers Kalu@@ zh@@ sky and old St@@ remo@@ v , to a game of cro@@ quet .
Anna read the note and sigh@@ ed deeply . ' I don '@@ t want anything , anything at all , ' she said to Ann@@ ush@@ ka , who was moving the bottles and br@@ ushes on the dressing table .
'@@ Oh , my God !
my God ! ' she kept repeating , but neither the word God or my had any meaning for her .
she knew that she could find no help in religion unless she was prepared to give up that which alone gave a meaning to her life .
she was not only disturbed , but was beginning to be afraid of a new mental condition such as she had never before experienced .
she felt as if everything was being doubled in her soul , just as objects appear doubled to weary eyes .
'@@ Oh , dear ! what am I doing ! ' she said to herself suddenly , feeling pain in both sides of her head .
when she came to her senses she found that she was cl@@ ut@@ ching her hair and pressing her temples with both hands .
'@@ Coffee is ready , and Ma '@@ m@@ '@@ sel@@ le and Ser@@ ez@@ ha are waiting , ' said Ann@@ ush@@ ka , coming in again and finding Anna in the same position .
Anna asked , reviving suddenly , as for the first time that morning she remembered the existence of her son .
'@@ It seems he has got into trouble , ' answered Ann@@ ush@@ ka with a smile .
'@@ You had some pe@@ aches in the corner room ; it seems he has eaten one of them on the quiet . '
the thought of her son at once took Anna out of the hopeless condition she had been in .
whatever position she might accept she could not give up her son .
she must be calm and escape from this terrible situation .
she dressed quickly and with determined steps entered the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room , where Ser@@ ez@@ ha and his govern@@ ess were waiting breakfast for her as usual .
his govern@@ ess was looking exceptionally stern .
the govern@@ ess began to give a long and detailed account of his mis@@ conduct , but Anna did not listen to her . she was wondering whether to take her also or not .
'@@ no , I won '@@ t , ' she decided . ' I will go alone with my son . '
I ... I ... ' he said , trying to find out from her face what he was to expect for eating the pe@@ ach .
'@@ Ser@@ ez@@ ha , ' she said as soon as the govern@@ ess had gone away , ' it was wrong , but you won '@@ t do it again ? ... You love me ? '
the tears were already streaming down her cheeks , and in order to hide them she jumped up abruptly and went out on to the ver@@ and@@ ah .
she shi@@ vered with cold , and with the terror that seized her with new power out in the open air .
'@@ Go to Mari@@ ette , ' she said to Ser@@ ez@@ ha , who had come out after her , and she began pac@@ ing up and down the straw mat@@ ting of the ver@@ and@@ ah .
'@@ is it possible that they could not forgive me or understand that it could not have been otherwise ? ' she asked herself .
'@@ no , no , I must not think , ' she said to herself ; ' I must get ready to go .
'@@ To Moscow ? yes , by the evening train , with Ann@@ ush@@ ka and Ser@@ ez@@ ha , and with only the most necessary things .
but first I must write to both of them . '
she quickly went to her sitting @@@ -@@ @ room and wrote to her husband .
'@@ After what has happened I can no longer remain in your house .
I am going away and taking my son .
I do not know the law and therefore I do not know to which of his parents a son must be left , but I am taking him because I C@@ AN@@ NOT live without him .
be generous and leave him to me ! '
up to that point she wrote quickly and naturally , but the appeal to his generosity , in which she did not believe , and the necessity of finishing the letter with something moving , stopped her ...
'@@ i C@@ AN@@ NOT speak of my fault and my repentance because ... '
she stopped again , unable to connect her thoughts .
'@@ i have informed my husband , ' she began , and was unable to write any more .
it seemed so coarse and un@@ wom@@ an@@ ly .
'@@ Be@@ sides , what can I write to him ? ' she asked herself ; and again she bl@@ ushed with shame .
she thought of his calm@@ ness , and a feeling of v@@ ex@@ ation with him made her tear the paper to pieces , with the one sentence written on it .
'@@ There is no need to write anything , ' she thought , closed her blo@@ tting @@@ -@@ @ book , went up@@ stairs to tell the govern@@ ess and the servants that she was going to Moscow that evening , and then began packing .
in ALL THE RO@@ O@@ MS of the country house porters , gar@@ den@@ ers , and foot@@ men went about carrying out the things .
cu@@ p@@ boards and ch@@ ests of draw@@ ers stood open , twice the nearest shop had been sent to for balls of string . the floor was stre@@ wn with newspapers .
Anna looked out and saw K@@ aren@@ in 's messenger in the por@@ ch ringing the bell .
'@@ Go and see what it is , ' she said , and , calmly prepared for anything , sat down in an easy @@@ -@@ @ chair and folded her hands on her knees .
a foot@@ man brought her a thick envelope addressed in her husband 's hand@@ writing .
'@@ the messenger has been told to wait for an answer , ' he said .
'@@ all right , ' she replied , and as soon as he had gone she t@@ ore open the envelope with trembling fingers .
a packet of new still unfol@@ ded notes in a paper band fell out .
I beg you will note that I attach importance to this request of mine , ' she read .
having glanced through it , she went back and read it again from the beginning .
when she had finished she felt cold , and knew that a more dreadful mis@@ fortune had be@@ fallen her than she had ever expected .
yes , a mean , hor@@ rid man !
and no one but I understands or will understand it , and I C@@ AN@@ NOT explain it .
they say he 's a religious , moral , honest , and wise man , but they do not see what I have seen .
they do not know how for eight years he has been smo@@ ther@@ ing my life , smo@@ ther@@ ing everything that was alive in me , that he never once thought I was a live woman , in need of love .
they do not know how at every step he hurt me and remained self @@@ -@@ @ satisfied .
have I not tried , tried with all my might , to find a purpose in my life ?
have I not tried to love him , tried to love my son when I could no longer love my husband ?
but the time came when I understood that I could no longer deceive myself that I am alive , and C@@ AN@@ NOT be blamed because God made me so , that I want to love and to live .
if he killed me - if he had killed him , - I would have borne anything , I would have forgiven anything ! but no !
he will do what is consistent with his low nature .
but don '@@ t I know why he said it ? he does not believe in my love for my son or he desp@@ ises it .
'@@ That life was painful before , lately it has been dreadful . what will it be now ?
I know him ; I know that he swim@@ s and deli@@ ghts in false@@ hood as a fish does in water . but no !
I will not give him that pleasure , come what will . I will break this web of lies in which he wishes to ent@@ angle me .
was a woman ever as unhappy as I am ? ...
no , I shall break it off , break it off ! ' she exclaimed , jumping up and forcing back her tears .
she sat down at her writing @@@ -@@ @ table , but instead of writing she folded her arms on the table and put her head on them , and began to cry , so@@ b@@ bing with her whole bos@@ om heav@@ ing , as a child cries .
she knew beforehand that everything would remain as it was and would be even far worse than before .
she knew that it would be so , and yet it was so terrible that she could not even imagine how it would end .
and she cried , without restraint , like a punished child .
the approaching step of the foot@@ man recalled her to herself , and hiding her face from him she pre@@ tended to be writing .
'@@ the messenger is asking for the answer , ' he said .
yes , let him wait : I will ring , ' said Anna .
that I am in love ? '
and she felt again a sch@@ ism in her soul , and again was frightened by the feeling ; so she seized the first pretext for action that occurred to her to divert her thoughts from herself .
'@@ i must see Alex@@ is , ' as she called V@@ ron@@ sky in her thoughts . ' he alone can tell me what to do .
she wrote to her husband : ' I have received your letter . - A. , ' rang , and gave the note to the foot@@ man .
'@@ no , but don '@@ t un@@ pack till to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row , and let the carriage wait .
'@@ What dress shall I put out ? '
the cro@@ quet MAT@@ CH to which the Princess T@@ ver@@ skaya had invited Anna was to be played by two ladies and their admir@@ ers .
the two ladies were the chief representatives of a choice new Petersburg circle called , in imitation of an imitation of something , Les S@@ ept m@@ erv@@ e@@ illes du mon@@ de .
these ladies belonged to a circle which , though higher , was entirely hostile to the set Anna frequ@@ ented .
old St@@ remo@@ v - one of Petersburg 's influential men , and Lisa Mer@@ kal@@ ova 's ad@@ orer - was also officially hostile to K@@ aren@@ in .
these considerations had made Anna reluctant to come , and it was to her refusal that the hints in Princess T@@ ver@@ skaya 's note had referred .
but now the hope of seeing V@@ ron@@ sky had brought Anna .
she arrived at the Princess T@@ ver@@ skaya 's house before the other visitors .
just as she arrived V@@ ron@@ sky 's foot@@ man , who with his well @@@ -@@ @ br@@ ushed whis@@ kers looked like a Gent@@ l@@ eman of the bed@@ chamber , also came up .
he stopped at the door , took off his cap , and let her pass .
Anna saw him , and only then remembered that the evening before V@@ ron@@ sky had said that he was not coming .
probably he had sent a note to say so .
as she was taking off her outdoor things in the hall she heard the foot@@ man - who even pronounced his r 's like a Gent@@ l@@ eman of the bed@@ chamber - say : ' from the Count to the Princess , ' as he delivered the note .
she felt inclined to ask where his master was ; she wanted to go home and write to him to come to her house , or to go to him herself . but none of these things could be done .
will you not come into the garden ? ' said another foot@@ man in the next room .
everything did itself .
when she met Bet@@ sy coming toward her in a white costume that struck Anna by its elegance , Anna smiled at her as usual .
there must have been something unusual about Anna 's look , for Bet@@ sy noticed it at once .
'@@ i have slept badly , ' answered Anna , gaz@@ ing at the foot@@ man , who she guessed was bringing V@@ ron@@ sky 's note .
why she had said something she had not even thought of a moment before she could not have explained .
her only reason for saying it was that since V@@ ron@@ sky was not coming she must secure her freedom and try to see him in some other way .
'@@ no , I won '@@ t let you go on any account , ' said Bet@@ sy , fixing her eyes int@@ ently on Anna . ' I should be really hurt , if I were not so fond of you .
she took the note from him and read it . ' Alex@@ is has failed us , ' she said in French .
Anna was aware that Bet@@ sy knew everything , but when she heard her talk about V@@ ron@@ sky she always felt a mom@@ entary conviction that Bet@@ sy knew nothing about it .
'@@ no ! perhaps you do not want to meet St@@ remo@@ v ?
let him and Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich break lan@@ ces at their Committee Meetings ; that has nothing to do with us .
in Society he is the most am@@ i@@ able man I know , and a passionate cro@@ quet player .
you 'll see !
and in spite of his ridiculous position as Lisa 's old ad@@ mi@@ rer , you should see how he carries it off .
he is very charming .
Sap@@ ph@@ o Stol@@ z you do not know ?
she is quite a new type . '
while Bet@@ sy was saying this Anna saw by her bright intelligent look that she partly understood Anna 's position and was dev@@ ising something .
they were in a small sitting @@@ -@@ @ room .
'@@ But I must write to Alex@@ is ; ' and Bet@@ sy sat down at the table , wrote a few words , and put the paper in an envelope .
without thinking for an instant Anna sat down at the table with Bet@@ sy 's note , and without reading it added at the bottom : ' I must see you .
I shall be there at six . '
she closed it , and Bet@@ sy returning sent it off in her presence .
'@@ She is very nice and was always attractive to me , ' said Anna .
'@@ You must love her : she do@@ tes on you .
she said that you are a real hero@@ ine for a novel , and that were she a man she would have committed a thousand fol@@ lies for your sake .
St@@ remo@@ v tells her she is committing them as it is ! '
I have not often met them ...
what are they ? '
Bet@@ sy looked at her with smiling eyes .
'@@ It is a new fashion , ' she replied .
'@@ They have all adopted that fashion .
'@@ Yes , but what are her relations with Kalu@@ zh@@ sky ? '
Bet@@ sy burst into an unexpected , mer@@ ry and un@@ controllable Pe@@ al of laughter , a thing she rarely did .
'@@ You are encro@@ aching on the Princess My@@ ag@@ k@@ aya 's domain !
'@@ It is all very well for you to laugh , ' said Anna , who could not help laughing too , ' but I never was able to understand it .
I C@@ AN@@ NOT understand the husband 's position . '
'@@ the husband 's !
Lisa Mer@@ kal@@ ova 's husband carries her ru@@ gs after her and is always at her service .
but what there is behind it all , no one really cares to know .
Don '@@ t you know that in good Society no one talks or even thinks about certain details of the toilet ?
'@@ Will you be at Rol@@ and@@ aki 's fate ? ' asked Anna in order to change the subject .
'@@ i don '@@ t think so , ' answered Bet@@ sy , and while looking at her friend she began filling the little transl@@ uc@@ ent cup with aromatic tea .
'@@ You see , ' she said , ' I am in a lucky position ! I understand you and I understand Lisa .
Lisa 's is one of those naive nat@@ ures who , like children , are unable to understand the difference between right and wrong .
at least she did not understand it when she was very young .
and now she knows that that role of not understanding becomes her .
now perhaps she is purpos@@ ely ingen@@ uous , ' and Bet@@ sy smiled poin@@ tedly . ' but still it becomes her .
you see a thing may be looked at trag@@ ically and turned to a tor@@ ment , or looked at quite simply , and even g@@ aily .
perhaps you are inclined to take things too trag@@ ically . '
sounds OF footsteps and a man 's voice , then that of a woman followed by laughter , reached them , and the expected visitors entered the room , Sap@@ ph@@ o Stol@@ z and a young man , shining with a super@@ abundance of health , known as Vas@@ ka .
it was evident that he flourished on under@@ done beef , tru@@ ff@@ les , and B@@ urg@@ un@@ dy .
he came into the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room behind Sap@@ ph@@ o and followed her across the room as if he were tied to her , with his glit@@ tering eye fixed on her as if he were ready to eat her .
Sap@@ ph@@ o Stol@@ z had fair hair and black eyes .
she entered with a short , b@@ risk step , in shoes with high French heels and shook hands with the ladies with a firm grip like a man .
Anna had never met this celebrity before , and was struck by her beauty , by the extravag@@ ant fashion of her costume , and by the bold@@ ness of her manners .
Bet@@ sy ha@@ st@@ ened to introduce her to Anna .
Vas@@ ka again bowed to Anna , but said nothing .
he turned to Sap@@ ph@@ o : ' you have lost the bet : we have arrived first .
pay up ! ' he said smiling .
Sap@@ ph@@ o laughed still more mer@@ r@@ ily .
'@@ Su@@ rely not now ! ' she said .
'@@ Never mind , I will have it later . '
'@@ all right ! all right !
I have brought you a visitor !
the unexpected young visitor Sap@@ ph@@ o had brought with her and forgotten was nevertheless so important a person@@ age that , in spite of his youth , both ladies rose to greet him .
he was Sap@@ ph@@ o 's new ad@@ mi@@ rer , and followed at her heels just like Vas@@ ka .
then the Prince Kalu@@ zh@@ sky arrived , and Lisa Mer@@ kal@@ ova with St@@ remo@@ v .
Lisa Mer@@ kal@@ ova was a slight br@@ un@@ ette with a lazy Oriental type of face and beautiful ( everybody said un@@ fa@@ th@@ om@@ able ) eyes .
the character of her dark costume , as Anna at once noticed and appreciated , was perfectly suited to her style of beauty .
she was really ingen@@ uous , and a perver@@ ted but a sweet and irresponsible woman .
this radi@@ ance shone out of her beautiful and really un@@ fa@@ th@@ om@@ able eyes .
'@@ Yes , I never thought it would be so exciting , ' replied Anna , bl@@ ushing .
the company rose to go into the garden .
'@@ i won '@@ t go , ' said Lisa , smiling and sitting down beside Anna . ' you won '@@ t go either ? who wants to play cro@@ quet ? '
it che@@ ers me to look at you .
why , yours is the g@@ ay@@ est set in Petersburg , ' said Anna .
'@@ It may be that those who are not in our set are still more bored , but we - I at any rate - do not feel mer@@ ry , but terribly , terribly bored . '
Sap@@ ph@@ o lit a cigarette and went out into the garden with the two young men .
Bet@@ sy and St@@ remo@@ v stayed at the tea @@@ -@@ @ table .
'@@ Bo@@ red ! ' said Bet@@ sy . ' Sap@@ ph@@ o said that they had a very j@@ ol@@ ly time at your house yesterday . '
'@@ i do not do anything , ' said Anna , bl@@ ushing at these insist@@ ent questions .
Lisa Mer@@ kal@@ ova was his wife 's ni@@ ece and he spent all his spare time with her .
that is what Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna says . '
'@@ i should have been pleased to have said it , for it is not only wise , but true , ' said Anna , smiling .
'@@ no , but tell me why one C@@ AN@@ NOT fall asleep and C@@ AN@@ NOT help being bored ? '
'@@ To fall asleep one must have worked , and also to am@@ use oneself one must have worked . '
'@@ You are in@@ cor@@ ri@@ gible , ' said St@@ remo@@ v without looking at her , and again turned to Anna .
T@@ ush@@ kevich came in to say that everybody was waiting for the cro@@ quet players .
St@@ remo@@ v joined her in the ent@@ reat@@ y .
'@@ the contrast will be too great , ' he remarked , ' if you go to see the old Countess V@@ re@@ de after leaving this company here .
besides , your visit will give her an opportunity to back@@ bite , while here , on the contrary , you ar@@ ouse the best feelings , quite opposed to back@@ b@@ iting . '
in spite OF H@@ IS apparently reckless EX@@ IST@@ ENCE , V@@ ron@@ sky W@@ AS a man who hated disorder .
while quite young and still in the Cad@@ et Corps he had experienced the humiliation of a refusal when , having got into debt , he had tried to borrow money , and since then he had never again allowed himself to get into such a position .
the morning after the races he woke late , and without having a bath or sha@@ ving he put on a linen tun@@ ic and , spreading out before him his money , his accounts , and his bills and letters , he set to work .
when Petr@@ itsky - who knew that on such occasions V@@ ron@@ sky was often cross - on waking saw his friend at his writing @@@ -@@ @ table , he dressed quietly and went out without disturbing him .
and so thought V@@ ron@@ sky .
and not without some inward pride , nor without some justification , he reflected that any other man would long ago have got embro@@ iled and been obliged to act badly if placed in a situation as difficult as his .
but V@@ ron@@ sky felt that it was necessary for him to investigate his affairs just at that time in order to keep out of trouble .
he began by first attacking his money problems , as the easiest to deal with .
having noted down in his small hand@@ writing on a piece of not@@ ep@@ aper all he owed , he made up the account and found that it came to seventeen thousand and a few hundred roubles .
these debts came to about 4000 roubles : 1500 for a horse and 2500 he had incurred by standing security for his young com@@ rade Ven@@ evsky , who in V@@ ron@@ sky 's presence had lost that sum to a card @@@ -@@ @ shar@@ per .
V@@ ron@@ sky had wished to pay at the time - he had the money with him - but Ven@@ evsky and Y@@ ash@@ vin insisted that they would pay , and would not permit V@@ ron@@ sky , who had not even been playing , to do so .
so that for the first part of his debt he must have 4000 roubles ready .
eight thousand roubles under the second heading were less important : they were owing chiefly for the use of the rac@@ ec@@ our@@ se st@@ ables , to the o@@ ats and ha@@ y @@@ -@@ @ dealer , to the Englis@@ hman , to the Sadd@@ ler and others .
in respect of these debts it was necessary to pay out 2000 roubles , in order to be quite secure .
the remaining debts were owing to shops , hotels , and to his tailor , and there was no need to trouble about them .
so he needed 6000 roubles for immediate use , and had only 1800 roubles ready money .
his father 's immense fortune , which alone brought in 200,000 a year , had not been divided between the brothers .
at that time Alex@@ is told his brother that this would suffice for him till he married , which in all probability he never would do .
and his brother , commanding one of the most expensive regim@@ ents , and newly married , could not refuse this gift .
their mother , who had her own private fortune , allowed Alex@@ is about 20,000 roubles a year in addition to the 25,000 agreed upon , and Alex@@ is spent it all .
lat@@ terly his mother , having quar@@ rel@@ led with him about his connection with Anna and his departure from Moscow , had stopped his allowance .
consequently V@@ ron@@ sky , who was in the habit of spending 4@@ 5,000 roubles a year , having this year received only 25,000 , found himself in difficulties .
he could not ask his mother to help him out of them .
his mother 's wish to bribe him offended him to the bottom of his soul and increased his col@@ dness toward her .
it was as impossible as to beat a woman , to steal , or to tell a lie .
having decided on this , he at once wrote a note to Rol@@ and@@ aki , who had more than once offered to buy his horses .
then he sent for the money @@@ -@@ @ lender and the Englis@@ hman , and allo@@ tted what money he had among the different bills .
having finished this business he wrote a cold and abrupt reply to his mother .
V@@ ron@@ sky W@@ AS particularly fortunate in that he had a code of rules which clearly defined what should and should not be done .
these rules might be irrational and bad but they were absolute , and in complying with them V@@ ron@@ sky felt at ease and could carry his head high .
his present relations to her and her husband were clear and simple to him .
they were very clearly and exactly defined in the code of rules by which he was guided .
she was a respectable woman who had given him her love , and he loved her ; therefore she was for him a woman worthy of as much or even more respect than a legitimate wife .
he would have let his hand be cut off before he would have allowed himself by word or hint to insult her , or fail to show her all the respect that a woman can possibly desire .
his relations toward Society were also clear .
his relations to her husband were simplest of all .
from the moment that Anna gave him her love he considered his own right to her inde@@ feasible .
her husband was only a super@@ flu@@ ous person and a hind@@ r@@ ance .
no doubt he was in a p@@ iti@@ able position , but what was to be done ?
the only right the husband had was , weapon in hand , to demand satisfaction , and that V@@ ron@@ sky from the first was prepared to give him .
but lat@@ terly new inner relations had sp@@ run@@ g up between himself and her , which frightened him by their inde@@ fin@@ it@@ eness .
he was taken by surprise , and at the moment when she told him of her condition his heart had suggested his proposal to her to leave her husband .
he had made this proposal , but now , thinking it over , he saw clearly that it would be better to avoid that plan , and yet , while he told himself so , he feared that this might be wrong .
'@@ When I told her to leave her husband , that meant that she should unite herself with me .
am I ready for that ?
how can I take her away now that I have no money ?
no doubt I could arrange that ... but how could I go away with her while I am in the army ?
having proposed it , I must be ready to carry it out - that is to say I must find the money and leave the army . '
the question of whether to leave or not to leave the army led him to another private matter - almost the chief , though the secret , interest of his life .
ambition was the old motive of his childhood and youth , one which he did not acknowledge even to himself , but which was so strong a passion that it now struggled against his love .
his first steps in Society and in the service had been successful , but two years ago he had made a bad bl@@ under .
in reality he had begun to feel dissatisfied about the time that he went to Moscow the year before .
'@@ of course I am not jeal@@ ous and could not be jeal@@ ous of Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy , but his promotion shows me that if one bid@@ es one 's time the career of such a man as myself may be very quickly made .
three years ago he and I were in the same position .
by remaining in the service I lose nothing .
she herself said that she did not want to change her position ; and I , having her love , C@@ AN@@ NOT envy Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy . '
everything was clear and distinct , as after his former period@@ ical stock@@ takings .
he sha@@ ved , had a cold bath , dressed , and went out .
'@@ i HAV@@ E CO@@ ME FOR YOU ; your washing has taken a long time ! ' said Petr@@ itsky . ' well , is it done ? '
V@@ ron@@ sky looked at his com@@ rade without answering , thinking about something else .
'@@ is that where the music is ? ' he said , listening to the familiar strains , now audi@@ ble , of brass instruments playing pol@@ kas and wal@@ t@@ zes . ' what 's up ? '
'@@ Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy has arrived . '
'@@ ah ! I did not know , ' exclaimed V@@ ron@@ sky .
his smiling eyes shone still more brightly .
Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy was a good friend and he was glad that he would see him .
'@@ i am very glad . '
Dem@@ in the C.@@ O. occupied a large country house , and the whole party were gathered together on the ro@@ omy ver@@ and@@ ah .
after returning to the table , the Commander again came forward with a glass of champagne in his hand and announced a to@@ ast : ' to the health of our late com@@ rade , the gall@@ ant General , Prince Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy !
following the Commander , champagne glass in hand , Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy came down smiling .
V@@ ron@@ sky had not seen Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy for three years .
one change V@@ ron@@ sky noticed in him was that quiet and permanent radi@@ ance which comes upon the faces of people who have succeeded and feel assured that everybody recognizes their success .
V@@ ron@@ sky knew that kind of radi@@ ance , and noticed it at once on Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy 's face .
as he was descending the steps Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy noticed V@@ ron@@ sky .
a smile of joy lit up his face .
he jer@@ ked his head backwards and raised his glass , welcoming V@@ ron@@ sky and showing by this gesture that he must first go to the ser@@ ge@@ ant @@@ -@@ @ major , who was already stretching himself and p@@ uck@@ ering his lips for a kiss .
'@@ ah , here he is ! ' exclaimed the Commander , ' and Y@@ ash@@ vin told me that you were in one of your dismal moods . '
Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy kis@@ sed the smart @@@ -@@ @ looking ser@@ ge@@ ant @@@ -@@ @ major on his mo@@ ist fresh lips and , wi@@ ping his mouth on his hand@@ ker@@ chief , stepped up to V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ Well , I am glad ! ' he said , taking him apart and pressing his hand .
'@@ You look after him , ' shouted the Commander to Y@@ ash@@ vin , and went out to the soldiers .
'@@ Why were you not at the races yesterday ?
I thought I should see you there , ' asked V@@ ron@@ sky , examining Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy .
excuse me ! ' he added , and turned to his ad@@ j@@ ut@@ ant . ' please give orders to distribute this money equally among the men . '
'@@ V@@ ron@@ sky , will you eat something , or have a drink ? ' said Y@@ ash@@ vin . ' Hey !
they drank a great deal .
then the C.@@ O. danced with Petr@@ itsky in front of the singers .
after that , feeling rather weak , he sat down on a bench in the yard and began demonstrating to Y@@ ash@@ vin Russia 's superiority to Prussia , especially in cav@@ alry charges , and the car@@ ous@@ al qui@@ eted down for a moment .
Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy went to the dressing @@@ -@@ @ room to wash his hands , and found V@@ ron@@ sky there .
V@@ ron@@ sky had taken off his coat and was washing his hair@@ y red neck under the wash@@ stand tap , rubbing it and his head with his hands .
when he had finished his ab@@ lu@@ tions V@@ ron@@ sky sat down beside Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy on a little sofa in the dressing @@@ -@@ @ room and began a conversation of great interest to both of them .
'@@ i used to hear all about you from my wife , ' said Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy . ' I am glad you saw a good deal of her . '
'@@ She is friends with Var@@ ya , and they are the only women in Petersburg whom it is a pleasure for me to meet , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky with a smile .
he smiled because he fores@@ aw the turn their conversation would take and was pleased .
'@@ the only ones ? ' asked Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy , smiling .
'@@ Yes , and I used to hear about you , but not only from your wife , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , checking the hint by a serious look . ' I am very glad of your success but not at all surprised .
I expected even more . '
Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy smiled .
V@@ ron@@ sky 's opinion of him evidently gave him pleasure and he saw no reason to hide it .
'@@ i , on the contrary - I must frankly admit - expected less .
but I am pleased , very pleased ; I am ambitious , it is my weakness , and I acknowledge it . '
'@@ Per@@ haps you would not if you were not successful , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ i do not think so , ' and Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy smiled again . ' I do not mean to say I could not live without it , but it would be a bore .
'@@ It may be so for you , but not for every one .
I used to think the same , yet here I am living and find that it is not worth while living for that alone , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky .
there you are ! ' said Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy , laughing . ' I had begun by saying that I used to hear about you , about your refusal ...
of course I approved of it .
but there is a way of doing a thing , and I think that , though your action was good in itself , you did not do it in the right way . '
'@@ What is done is done , and you know that I never go back on what I have done .
but you will not remain satisfied for long .
I should not say that to your brother .
he is a dear child , just like this host of ours : hear him ! ' he added , listening to the cries of ' Hur@@ rah ! '
'@@ What do you mean ?
'@@ no ; ' said Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy , fro@@ w@@ ning with v@@ ex@@ ation at being suspected of such nonsense . ' t@@ out ç@@ a est une bl@@ ague . '
it always has existed and always will .
there are no Communists whatever .
but schem@@ ing people always have invented and always will invent some harmful and dangerous Party .
that 's an old trick .
what is wanted is an influential Party of independent men like you and me . '
'@@ But why - ' V@@ ron@@ sky named several influential men , ' why are not they independent men ? '
'@@ Only because they have not , or had not by birth , an independent position - had no name , were not born as near the sun as we were .
they can be bought by money or by aff@@ ability , and must invent a theory to keep their positions .
and they bring forward some idea , some theory ( in which they themselves do not believe and which does harm ) merely as a means of pro@@ curing government quarters and a salary .
maybe I am worse and more foolish than they , though I do not see why I am worse than they .
any@@ how you and I have one great advantage : we C@@ AN@@ NOT be bought so easily .
and such men are more needed than ever . '
and , ashamed as he was of the fact , he felt jeal@@ ous .
'@@ all the same I lack the most necessary thing , ' he replied . ' I lack the wish for power .
'@@ Par@@ don me , that is not true , ' said Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy with a smile .
'@@ Yes , it is , it is true ... at present to be quite frank , ' added V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ Yes , it is true at present - that is another matter , but the present will not last for ever . '
'@@ You say " perhaps , " - ' continued Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy as if he had guessed V@@ ron@@ sky 's thoughts ; ' but I say , certainly .
that is why I wanted to see you . you acted rightly : I quite understand it .
but you must not pers@@ ev@@ ere in it .
I only ask you to give me carte bl@@ anche .
I am not patron@@ izing you ...
though why should I not patron@@ ize you ?
you have so often patron@@ ized me !
I hope our friendship is above that sort of thing !
yes , ' he said with a smile tender as a woman 's , ' Gi@@ ve me carte bl@@ anche , leave the regiment , and I will draw you on im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly . '
'@@ But try to understand that I do want nothing except that everything should remain as it is , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ You say , " that all should remain as it is " !
I know what you mean , but hear me !
V@@ ron@@ sky was anxious now to hear the rest of what Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy had to say .
women are the chief stumbling @@@ -@@ @ block in a man 's career .
it is difficult to love a woman and do anything else .
to achieve it and to love in comfort and un@@ hampered , the only way is to marry !
how am I to put to you what I think ? ' and Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy , who was fond of simil@@ es , went on : ' wait a bit ! wait a bit ! ...
yes , if you had to carry a load and use your hands at the same time , it would be possible only if the load were str@@ apped on your back : and that is marriage .
I found that out when I married .
I suddenly had my hands free .
but if you drag that load without marriage , your hands are so full that you can do nothing else .
they have ruined their careers because of women . '
'@@ But what women ! ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , recalling the French@@ woman and the actress with whom these men were ent@@ angled .
that is not like merely dragging a load with one 's hands , it is like w@@ ren@@ ching it from some one else . '
'@@ You have never loved , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky softly , with his eyes looking straight before him and with Anna in his thoughts .
but another point : women are always more materi@@ alistic than men .
men make of love something enormous , but women are always Ter@@ re @@@ -@@ @ à @@@ -@@ @ Ter@@ re . [ matter @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ fact . ]
'@@ Coming , coming ! ' he said , turning to a foot@@ man who had entered .
but the foot@@ man had not come to call them , as Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy thought .
he brought V@@ ron@@ sky a note .
'@@ Your man brought this from the Princess T@@ ver@@ skaya . '
V@@ ron@@ sky opened the note and his face fl@@ ushed .
'@@ My head has begun aching , ' he said . ' I shall go home . '
it W@@ AS AL@@ RE@@ AD@@ Y P@@ AST FI@@ VE , and in order not to be late and not to use his own horses , which were known to everybody , V@@ ron@@ sky took Y@@ ash@@ vin 's hired carriage and told the co@@ ach@@ man to drive as fast as possible .
this feeling was so strong that he could not help smiling .
'@@ Deli@@ ghtful ! O delightful ! ' he thought .
he had often before been joy@@ fully conscious of his body , but had never loved himself , his own body , as he did now .
it gave him pleasure to feel the slight pain in his strong leg , to be conscious of the muscles of his chest moving as he breath@@ ed .
that clear , cool August day which made Anna feel so hopeless seemed ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating and in@@ vigor@@ ating to him and refresh@@ ed his face and neck , which were glowing after their washing and rubbing .
the scent of brilli@@ antine given off by his mou@@ st@@ ache seemed peculi@@ arly pleasant in the fresh air .
the co@@ ach@@ man felt something in his hand , the whi@@ p cracked , and the carriage rolled quickly along the smooth mac@@ adam@@ ized high road .
where ?
why has she given me an appointment here , in a letter from Bet@@ sy ? ' he thought ; but there was no longer any time for thinking .
before reaching the avenue he ordered the co@@ ach@@ man to stop , opened the carriage door , jumped out while the carriage was still moving , and went up the avenue leading to the house .
there was no one in the avenue , but turning to the right he saw her .
on reaching him she cl@@ as@@ ped his hand firmly .
'@@ You are not angry that I told you to come ?
it was absolutely necessary for me to see you , ' she said ; and at sight of the serious and severe expression of her mouth under her veil his mood changed at once .
but how did you get here ? '
'@@ Never mind ! ' she said , putting her hand on his arm . ' come , I must speak to you . '
he felt that something had happened , and that this interview would not be a happy one .
in her presence he had no will of his own : without knowing the cause of her agitation he became infected by it .
'@@ What is it ? what ? ' he asked , pressing her hand against his side with his el@@ bow and trying to read her face .
she took a few steps in silence to gather courage , and then suddenly stopped .
'@@ i did not tell you last night , ' she began , breathing quickly and heavily , ' that on my way back with Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich I told him everything ... said I could not be his wife , and ... I told him all . '
he listened , involun@@ tarily leaning forward with his whole body as if trying so to ease her burden .
'@@ Yes , yes , that is better ! a thousand times better !
after reading her husband 's letter she knew in the depths of her heart that all would remain as it was , that she would not have the courage to disregard her position and give up her son in order to be united with her lover .
the afternoon spent at the Princess T@@ ver@@ skaya 's house had confirmed that thought .
yet this interview was still of extreme importance to her .
she hoped that the meeting might bring about a change in her position and save her .
if at this news he would firmly , passi@@ on@@ ately , and without a moment 's hesitation say to her : ' give up everything and fly with me ! ' she would abandon her son and go with him .
but the news had not the effect on him that she had desired : he only looked as if he had been offended by something .
'@@ It was not at all hard for me - it all came about of itself , ' she said , irrit@@ ably . ' and here ... ' she pulled her husband 's note from under her g@@ love .
'@@ Why do you tell me this ? ' she said . ' do you think I could doubt it ?
if I doubted it ... '
'@@ Who 's that coming ? ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , pointing to two ladies who were coming toward them . ' they may know us ! ' and he moved quickly in the direction of a side@@ walk , drawing her along with him .
after he had read the letter he looked up at her , but his look was not firm .
she understood at once that he had already considered this by himself , knew that whatever he might say he would not tell her all that he was thinking , and knew that her last hopes had been deceived .
'@@ You see what a man he is ! ' she said in a trembling voice . ' he ... '
'@@ Why impossible ? ' said Anna , forcing back her tears and clearly no longer att@@ aching any importance to what he would say .
she felt that her fate was decided .
V@@ ron@@ sky wanted to say that after what he considered to be the inevitable du@@ el it could not continue ; but he said something else .
'@@ It C@@ AN@@ NOT continue .
I hope that you will now leave him .
I hope ... ' he became confused and bl@@ ushed ' that you will allow me to arrange and to think out a life for ourselves . to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row ... '
'@@ And my son ? ' she exclaimed . ' you see what he writes ? I must leave him , and I C@@ AN@@ NOT do that and do not want to . '
'@@ De@@ grading for whom ? '
'@@ For everybody , and especially for you . '
'@@ You call it degrading ! do not call it that ; such words have no meaning for me , ' she replied trem@@ ulously .
she did not wish him to tell un@@ truths now .
she had only his love left , and she wanted to love him . ' try to understand that since I loved you everything has changed for me .
there is only one single thing in the world for me : your love !
if I have it , I feel so high and firm that nothing can be degrading for me .
tears of shame and despair cho@@ ked her . she stopped and burst into so@@ bs .
he also felt something rising in his throat , and for the first time in his life he felt ready to cry .
she silently shook her head . ' would it not be possible to take your son away with you and go away all the same ? '
now I go back to him , ' she said dr@@ y@@ ly .
'@@ on Tuesday I shall go back to Petersburg and everything will be decided . '
'@@ Yes , ' she said , ' but don '@@ t let us talk about it . '
Anna 's carriage , which she had sent away and ordered to return to the gate of the V@@ re@@ de Garden , drove up .
Anna took leave of V@@ ron@@ sky and went home .
K@@ aren@@ in entered the Council room , greeted the members and the president as usual , and took his seat , his hand lying ready on the paper before him .
among these papers were the statistics that he needed and a draft of the statement he was going to make .
but he did not really require the figures .
he remembered them all and did not even consider it necessary to go over in his mind what he was going to say .
he felt that the contents of his speech would be so important that every word would be significant .
yet as he listened to the general reports his face wore a most innocent and art@@ less look .
when he came to the Fundamental and Organ@@ ic Law his opponent jumped up and began to raise objections .
K@@ aren@@ in 's success was even greater than he had expected .
busy with the secretary , K@@ aren@@ in quite forgot that it was Tuesday , the day fixed for Anna 's return , and was surprised and un@@ pleas@@ antly star@@ tled when the foot@@ man came in to inform him of her arrival .
Anna returned to Petersburg early in the morning , and as she had wired that the carriage should be sent for her he might have expected her .
she sent word to her husband that she had arrived and went to her bou@@ do@@ ir , where she set to work sorting her things , expecting that he would come in to see her .
she knew that according to his habits he would soon go away to his work and she wished to see him first .
she passed through the ball@@ room to his study and resolutely went in .
when she entered he was sitting in his official uniform evidently ready to start , with his el@@ b@@ ows on a little table , looking wear@@ ily in front of him .
he came up , took her hand , and asked her to sit down .
'@@ i am very glad you have come , ' he said , sitting down beside her . he evidently wished to say something , but f@@ altered .
several times he tried to speak , but stopped .
although while preparing for this interview she had been teaching herself to desp@@ ise and blame him , she did not know what to say , and p@@ iti@@ ed him .
there was silence for some time . ' is Ser@@ ez@@ ha well ? ' he asked ; and without waiting for a reply he added , ' I am not dining at home to @@@ -@@ @ day and must be going at once . '
'@@ i meant to go away to Moscow , ' she said .
'@@ Oh no , you were quite right to come , ' he replied , and again became silent .
seeing that he had not the strength to begin , she began for him .
'@@ But our relations C@@ AN@@ NOT be what they were before , ' Anna began in a tim@@ id voice , looking at him with frightened eyes .
'@@ i C@@ AN@@ NOT be your wife , since I ... ' she began .
he laughed in a cruel , cold manner .
'@@ i suppose the kind of life you have chosen has affected your principles .
I respect or desp@@ ise both so much - I respect your past and desp@@ ise your present that the interpretation you give to my words was far from my thoughts ! '
Anna sigh@@ ed and hung her head .
'@@ Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich , what do you want of me ? '
'@@ What I want , is not to meet that person here , and for you to behave in such a way that neither Society nor the servants shall be able to accuse you , - for you not to see that man .
I think that is not much to ask !
and in return you will enjoy all the advantages of a wife without fulfilling her duties .
he stopped and let her pass first .
why did Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na tell me this ? I might have met her accidentally and then all would have come naturally , but now it is impossible ! '
'@@ i have been told , ' she wrote , ' that you have a side @@@ -@@ @ sadd@@ le . I hope you will bring it yourself . '
that was more than he could stand .
'@@ How can an intelligent woman with any del@@ icacy so humili@@ ate a sister ? '
he wrote ten notes and t@@ ore them all up , sending the sadd@@ le at last without any reply .
to say that he would come was impossible , because he could not come ; to say that something prevented him from coming , or that he was leaving home , was still worse .
but now he was glad to go away from the proximity of Kit@@ ty and from his farm , and especially to go shooting , an occupation which served him as the best sol@@ ace in all his troubles .
there W@@ AS NO RA@@ IL@@ WA@@ Y or stage @@@ -@@ @ coach to the S@@ uro@@ vsky district , and Levin went in his own tar@@ ant@@ as .
a clean@@ ly @@@ -@@ @ dressed young woman with gol@@ os@@ hes on her stock@@ ing@@ less feet was washing the floor in the passage .
the dog that followed Levin frightened her , but when she was told that it would not hurt her she at once began to laugh at her own alarm .
after pointing to the door with her bare arm she again sto@@ op@@ ed , hiding her handsome face , and went on sc@@ rubbing .
'@@ Yes , please . '
by the door stood a little cu@@ pboard with cro@@ ck@@ ery .
'@@ Look alive ! ' the old man called mer@@ r@@ ily after her , and approached Levin . ' is it to Nicholas Ivan@@ ich S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky you are going , sir ?
he too stops at our place , ' he began gar@@ rul@@ ously , leaning on the ban@@ isters of the por@@ ch .
in the midst of his conversation about his acquain@@ t@@ anc@@ eship with S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky the gates cre@@ aked again , and the lab@@ our@@ ers returning from the fields came into the yard with their Pl@@ ough@@ s and har@@ rows .
the horses harn@@ essed to the Pl@@ ough@@ s and har@@ rows were big and well @@@ -@@ @ fed .
Don '@@ t let the g@@ el@@ ding out , Fed@@ ot , lead him to the tr@@ ough . we 'll harness another . '
'@@ i say , father ! have those pl@@ ough@@ shares I ordered been brought ? ' asked a tall , robust young fellow , evidently the old man 's son .
'@@ There in the passage , ' answered the old man , winding the re@@ ins into a ring and throwing them on the ground . ' fix them on before we finish dinner . '
other women , young and handsome , middle @@@ -@@ @ aged , old and plain , some with children , others without , appeared from somewhere .
Levin took his provisions out of the tar@@ ant@@ as and invited the old man to have tea with him .
'@@ Why , I don '@@ t know ! we have had tea once to @@@ -@@ @ day , ' said he , evidently pleased to accept the invitation . ' well , just for company ! '
ten years previously he had rented about four hundred acres from the land@@ owner , and the year before he had bought them outright and rented another nine hundred from a neighbouring propri@@ et@@ or .
a small part of the land - the worst - he let , and with the aid of his family and two hired men cultivated about a hundred and twenty acres .
but Levin knew that he only did so for propri@@ ety 's sake and that in reality his farm was flourishing .
had his affairs been in a bad way he would not have bought land at thirty @@@ -@@ @ five roubles an acre , would not have married three of his sons and a ne@@ phe@@ w , and would not have twice rebuilt his hom@@ este@@ ad after fires , nor rebuilt it better each time .
from their conversation Levin gathered that he was not against new methods either .
he had planted many potatoes which had already flow@@ ered and were forming fruit , as Levin had noticed when passing the fields on the way , while Levin 's own potatoes were just beginning to flower .
he pl@@ ough@@ ed the land for the potatoes with an English pl@@ ough , which he had borrowed from a land@@ owner .
he also s@@ owed wheat .
Levin was struck especially by one little detail . the old peasant used the thin@@ nings of the ry@@ e as fodder for the horses .
many a time when Levin had seen this valuable food wasted he had wanted to have it gathered up , but had found this impossible .
'@@ There now ! we land@@ lords don '@@ t get on well because of the lab@@ our@@ ers , ' said Levin , handing him a tum@@ bler of tea .
take S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky now .
'@@ And yet you too use hired labour on your farm ? '
we can manage for ourselves . '
'@@ Father , Fin@@ ni@@ gan wants some tar fetched , ' said the woman with the gol@@ os@@ hes , coming in .
'@@ That 's how it is , sir , ' said the old man , rising ; and after crossing himself several times he thanked Levin and went out .
when Levin went into the back room to call his co@@ ach@@ man he found the whole peasant family at dinner .
the women served standing .
the vigorous young son with his mouth full of buck@@ wheat por@@ ridge was saying something funny , and everybody laughed hear@@ tily - the woman with the gol@@ os@@ hes laughing more mer@@ r@@ ily than anyone as she ref@@ illed the bowl with cab@@ bage soup .
and all the rest of the way to S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky 's he every now and then recalled that household , as if the impression it had left on him demanded special attention .
S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky W@@ AS marsh@@ al OF THE nobility in his district .
he was five years older than Levin and had long been married .
his young sister @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , whom Levin thought very pleasant , lived with them .
he knew that both S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky and his wife wanted to see her married to him , Levin .
and this knowledge spo@@ ilt the pleasure which he hoped his visit to S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky would give him .
S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky 's home life was extremely pleasant , and S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky himself was the best type of social worker that Levin had ever known , and Levin always found him very interesting .
S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky was an extreme Liberal .
but he could not call him a fool because S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky was not only very intelligent but also a very well @@@ -@@ @ educated man , who carried his education with extreme modesty .
there was no subject with which he was not acquainted , but he only exhibited his knowledge when forced to do so .
Levin tried but could not understand him , and regarded him and his life as animated rid@@ dles .
the S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sk@@ ys were friendly with Levin , and therefore he allowed himself to sound S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky and try to get to the very foundation of his philosophy of life , but it was all in vain .
now , after his dis@@ illusion with the work on his estate , Levin was especially pleased to stay a while with S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky .
'@@ These matters might not have been so important in the time of ser@@ f@@ dom and may be un@@ important in England .
the shooting did not prove as good as he had expected .
the mar@@ sh had dried up and there were hardly any sni@@ pe .
in the evening at tea a very interesting conversation sprang up , just as Levin had expected , in the company of two land@@ lords who had come about some guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship business .
Levin sat beside the host@@ ess at the tea table , and was obliged to con@@ verse with her and her sister , who was sitting opposite him .
the host@@ ess was a short , fair , round @@@ -@@ @ faced woman , be@@ aming with smiles and dim@@ ples .
Levin tried to find out through her the answer to the rid@@ dle , so important to him , presented by her husband ; but he had not full freedom of thought because he felt painfully uncomfortable .
Levin felt as if he were decei@@ ving some one , as if he ought to offer some explanation which was impossible , and therefore he kept bl@@ ushing and was rest@@ less and uncomfortable .
his discomfort communicated itself to the pretty sister , but the host@@ ess did not seem to notice anything and purpos@@ ely drew her sister into the conversation .
'@@ You say , ' the host@@ ess continued , ' that my husband C@@ AN@@ NOT feel an interest in anything Russian ?
on the contrary , though he is happy abroad , he is never so happy there as here .
he feels in his own sphere .
Oh ! you have not been to see our school ! '
'@@ i saw it ...
'@@ Yes , that is N@@ ast@@ ya 's business , ' she said , pointing to her sister .
'@@ You yourself teach ? ' asked Levin , trying to look beyond the bod@@ ice , but conscious that if he looked in her direction he must see it .
'@@ Yes , I have been and am still teaching , but we have a splendid master .
he looked with his glit@@ tering black eyes straight at an excited land@@ owner , with a grey mou@@ st@@ ache , whose words evidently am@@ used him .
this land@@ owner with the grey mou@@ st@@ ache was evidently an inv@@ eter@@ ate believer in ser@@ f@@ dom , and a passionate farmer who had lived long in the country .
'@@ But we see you don '@@ t give it up , ' said Nicholas Ivan@@ ich S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky , ' so it seems it has its advantages . '
you would hardly believe what drun@@ ken@@ ness and deb@@ au@@ ch@@ ery there is !
they are starving , yet if you hire one of them as a lab@@ ou@@ rer , he 'll spoil and break things , and will even lodge complaints with the magistr@@ ate . '
'@@ on the other hand you , too , complain to the magistr@@ ate . '
'@@ i complain ? never !
it would cause such gossip that one would be sorry one tried it .
and what did the magistr@@ ate do ?
he thr@@ ashes them in the old style .
the land@@ owner evidently meant to te@@ ase S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky , but the latter did not take offence ; on the contrary , he evidently enjoyed it .
'@@ Well , you see , we carry on our work without such measures , I and Levin and he , ' S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky said smiling , and pointing to the other land@@ owner .
'@@ My farming is very simple , thank heaven ! ' said Michael Pet@@ rovich .
'@@ My farming is to have money ready for the autumn taxes .
but it is true there are some dishonest ones among them . '
Levin , who had long been acquainted with these patri@@ arch@@ al methods , exchanged a glance with S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky , and , interrup@@ ting Michael Pet@@ rovich , addressed the land@@ owner with the grey mou@@ st@@ ache .
'@@ How then , in your opinion , should one carry on at present ? '
'@@ Why , carry on the way Michael Pet@@ rovich does : either pay the peasants in kind , or rent it to them ! that is quite possible , but the wealth of the community as a whole is ruined by such methods .
where my land used to yield nin@@ ef@@ old under ser@@ f@@ dom with good management , it only now yields thre@@ ef@@ old when the lab@@ our@@ ers are paid in kind .
S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky looked at Levin with smiling eyes , and even made a just percep@@ tible sar@@ cas@@ tic sign to him ridicul@@ ing the old man , but Levin did not consider the land@@ owner 's words ridiculous , he understood him better than he did S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky .
much of what the land@@ owner said subsequently , to prove that Russia was ruined by the E@@ man@@ cip@@ ation , even appeared to him to be very true , new , and undeniable .
take European history .
they must have been introduced at the time of the R@@ ur@@ ik Prin@@ ces , and doub@@ tless by force .
now that ser@@ f@@ dom has been abolished and the power taken out of our hands , our agriculture where it has been brought to a high level must descend to a savage and primitive condition .
if your farming is rational you can carry it on with hired labour , ' said S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky .
by means of whose labour am I to carry it on ? '
'@@ Here we have it ! the labour @@@ -@@ @ power is the chief element of agriculture , ' thought Levin .
'@@ Hi@@ red lab@@ our@@ ers don '@@ t want to work well with good tools .
our lab@@ our@@ ers understand one thing only : to get drunk like swine , and when drunk to spoil everything you put into their hands .
they hate to see anything that is beyond them .
that is why the level of agriculture has gone down .
and he began to develop his plan of emancip@@ ation , which might have prevented this dis@@ location .
'@@ the fact that our agriculture is sinking , that it is impossible , our relation to the peasants being what it is , to carry on our rational farming prof@@ itably , is quite true . '
we have no machines , no good horses , no proper management , and we do not know how to keep accounts .
ask any farmer ; he C@@ AN@@ NOT tell you what is profitable for you and what is not . '
'@@ Italian book@@ keeping ! ' said the land@@ owner scor@@ n@@ fully . ' keep your accounts as you will - if they spoil everything you have got , you won '@@ t have a profit ! '
'@@ Why spoil everything ?
they will break your inferior Russian thresh@@ ers , but they C@@ AN@@ NOT break my steam thresh@@ ing @@@ -@@ @ machine .
'@@ Yes ; if one can afford it , Nicholas Ivan@@ ich !
no , thank you ! '
'@@ i do not believe that it is either advisable or possible to raise the level of agriculture , ' said Levin . ' I go in for it , and have means , but I never could do anything .
I at any rate never spent money on improvements without loss . expensive cattle bring me a loss , and machinery too . '
'@@ Yes , that is quite true , ' said the land@@ owner with the grey mou@@ st@@ ache , and he even laughed with pleasure .
'@@ And I am not the only one , ' continued Levin . ' I can refer you to many farmers who carry on rational farming , and with rare exceptions they all make a loss on it .
besides , this question was not quite honest .
she did not remember the exact figure , though the German had calculated it down to a quarter of a kop@@ eck .
the land@@ owner smiled when the profits of S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky 's farming were mentioned , evidently aware of the sort of profits that his neighbour the Mar@@ sh@@ al of the Nob@@ ility was able to make .
'@@ It may be unprofitable , ' answered S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky , ' but that only shows that I am either a bad farmer or that I spend capital to raise the rent . '
but you had better tell us how the theory of rent can be ... '
Mary , send us some cur@@ ds and wh@@ ey or some r@@ asp@@ berries here , ' said S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky to his wife .
'@@ This year the r@@ asp@@ berries are lasting an extraordinarily long time , ' and S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky got up cheer@@ fully and moved away , evidently regarding the conversation as finished at the very point where to Levin it seemed to be just beginning .
'@@ Why do you think , ' asked Levin , trying to bring him back to the question , ' that we could not establish some relation with labour which would make it remun@@ er@@ ative ? '
'@@ It will never be done with Russians !
the lab@@ ou@@ rer , the hired man , the farmer , you C@@ AN@@ NOT get away from them . '
'@@ all I wish to say is , ' said Levin , ' why should we not seek them for ourselves ? '
'@@ Because it would be just the same as inventing new methods of building a railway .
'@@ But if they don '@@ t suit us ? if they are stupid ? ' said Levin .
and again he noticed a look of fear in the eyes of S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky .
'@@ Oh yes , it is all child 's play for us : we have discovered what Europe is looking for !
I know all that , but excuse me , do you know what has been accomplished in Europe with regard to the labour question ? '
'@@ the question is at present occupying the best brains in Europe .
then there is a whole gigantic literature on the labour question , with the most Liberal L@@ ass@@ al@@ le tendency ...
the Mul@@ hausen system - that is already a fact . I expect you know about it . '
'@@ i have some idea about it , but very vague . '
'@@ Oh , you only say so , I am sure you know about it just as well as I do !
I am , of course , not a professor of Soci@@ ology , but it interests me , and really if it interests you , you had better study the matter . '
'@@ Exc@@ use me ... '
the land@@ owners had risen , and S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky , having again checked Levin in his dis@@ agre@@ eable habit of pr@@ ying beyond the reception rooms of his mind , went to see his visitors off .
and he felt that it could be solved , and that he must try to do it .
beside the writing @@@ -@@ @ table was a stand with gold @@@ -@@ @ lab@@ elled draw@@ ers containing various business papers .
'@@ What is it you are looking at ? ' he asked Levin , who , having stopped at the round table , was looking at one of the journals .
and with characteristic clear@@ ness he briefly recoun@@ ted these new and very important and interesting discoveries .
though at present Levin was more interested in agriculture than in anything else , he asked himself while listening to his host , ' What is there inside him ?
and why , why does the Parti@@ tion of Poland interest him ? '
and when S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky had finished he could not help asking him , ' Well , and what of it ? '
but S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky had no answer to give .
it was interesting that ' it turns out , ' and he did not consider it necessary to explain why it interested him .
'@@ Yes , and I was greatly interested by that cross old land@@ owner , ' said Levin with a sigh . ' he is intelligent and said much that is true . '
he is secretly a rooted partisan of ser@@ f@@ dom like all of them ! ' said S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky .
'@@ Wh@@ ose Mar@@ sh@@ al you are ... '
'@@ Yes , but I marsh@@ al them in the opposite direction , ' said S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky , laughing .
whose fault is it ? '
'@@ Our own , of course ! but it is not true that it does not pay .
the people are on so low a level both of material and moral development that they are certain to oppose what is good for them .
in Europe rational farming answers because the people are educated ; therefore we must educate our people - that 's all . '
'@@ But how is one to educate them ? '
'@@ To educate the people three things are necessary : schools , schools , schools ! '
'@@ But you yourself just said that the people are on a low level of material development : how will schools help that ? '
'@@ But how will schools help ? '
'@@ By giving people other wants . '
'@@ Now that I never could understand , ' replied Levin , ho@@ tly . ' how will schools help the peasants to improve their material conditions ?
you say that schools and education will give them new wants .
so much the worse , for they won '@@ t be able to satisfy them .
and in what way knowing how to add and sub@@ tract and to say the cat@@ ech@@ ism will help them to improve their material condition , I never could understand !
the other evening I met a woman with an infant in her arms and asked her where she was going .
she replied that she had been to see the " wise woman " because her boy was fr@@ acti@@ ous , and she took him to be cured .
I asked her what cure the wise woman had for fr@@ acti@@ ousness .
" she puts the baby on the per@@ ch among the f@@ ow@@ ls and says something . " -@@ '
'@@ Well , there is your answer !
education will stop them from carrying their children to the ro@@ o@@ sts to cure them of fr@@ acti@@ ousness , ' said S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky with a mer@@ ry smile .
'@@ Oh , not at all ! ' said Levin , cros@@ sly . ' that treatment seems to me just a parallel to treating the peasants by means of schools .
the people are poor and ignorant , this we know as surely as the woman knows that the child is fr@@ acti@@ ous because it cries .
but why schools should cure the ills of poverty and ignorance is just as incomprehensible as why h@@ ens on their per@@ ches should cure fr@@ acti@@ ousness .
what needs to be cured is their poverty . '
'@@ Well , I am very glad , or rather very sorry , that I coincide with Spencer ; but it is a thing I have long known .
schools are no remedy , but the remedy would be an economic organization under which the people would be better off and have more leisure . then schools would come . '
'@@ Y@@ et all over Europe education is now compulsory . '
'@@ And how do you agree with Spencer yourself in this matter ? '
a frightened look fl@@ ashed up in S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky 's eyes and he said with a smile :
Levin saw that he would not succeed in finding a connection between this man 's life and his thoughts .
it was evidently all the same to him what conclusions his reasoning led to : he only needed the process itself , and he did not like it when the process of reasoning led him up a blind alley .
that he dis@@ liked and ev@@ aded by turning the conversation to something pleas@@ antly j@@ oc@@ ular .
all the impressions of that day , beginning with the impression of the peasant at the halfway @@@ -@@ @ house which seemed to serve as a foundation for all the other impressions and ideas , ag@@ itated Levin greatly .
left alone in the room assigned to him , and lying on a spring matt@@ ress which b@@ ounced unexpectedly whenever he moved a leg or an arm , it was long before Levin could sleep .
not one of the talks he had had with S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky , though much that was clever had been said by the latter , interested him , but the land@@ owner 's arguments required consideration .
Levin involun@@ tarily remembered all that the man had said , and corrected in imagination the answers he himself had given .
your and our common dissatisfaction with farming shows that we , and not the peasants , are at fault .
we have long pushed on in our own way - the European way - without considering the nature of the labour force available .
let us consider the lab@@ ou@@ rer not as an abstract labour force but as a Russian peasant with his own instincts , and let us arrange our farming accordingly .
divide equally and give half the produce to labour , and the share left for you will be larger , and the labour force will receive more .
and to do this we must lower the level of cultivation and give the peasants an interest in its success .
how this can be done is a question of details , but it is certainly possible . " -@@ '
this thought strongly excited Levin .
he lay awake half the night considering the details necessary for carrying his thought into effect .
he had not meant to leave next day , but now decided to go away early in the morning .
one of the chief difficulties was that the farming was actually going on and it was impossible to stop it all and start af@@ resh ; so that the machine had to be altered while it was working .
he remarked that he had always said so but had not been listened to .
another stumbling @@@ -@@ @ block was the peasant 's inv@@ inci@@ ble mistrust of the possibility of a land@@ lord having any other aim than that of rob@@ bing them as much as possible .
they were firmly convinced that his real aim ( whatever he might say ) would always be hidden in what he did not tell them .
and they themselves , when they talked , said much , but never said what they really wanted .
yet in spite of all these difficulties he got his way , and by autumn the scheme began to work , or at any rate it seemed so to him .
the cattle @@@ -@@ @ yard , the fruit and vegetable gardens , the meadows and the corn @@@ -@@ @ fields , divided into several parts , should come under different sections .
the rest remained as before ; but these three sections were the beginning of a new order and fully occupied Levin .
it was true that Theodore Re@@ z@@ un@@ w 's group did not pl@@ ough the corn land twice with the English pl@@ ough as they had agreed to do , ple@@ ading lack of time .
it was true that Sh@@ ur@@ aev had taken steps to sub@@ let the kitchen garden in small lots to the other peasants ; he evidently quite misunderstood , and apparently intentionally misunderstood , the conditions on which the land was let to him .
these affairs added to the rest of the farming which remained on his hands , and the indoor work on his book , so filled Levin 's whole summer that he hardly ever made time to go out shooting .
at the end of August he heard from a servant who brought back the side @@@ -@@ @ sadd@@ le that the O@@ bl@@ on@@ sk@@ ys had gone back to Moscow .
he felt that by not having answered Dol@@ ly O@@ bl@@ on@@ skaya 's letter ( a ru@@ den@@ ess he could not remember without bl@@ ushing ) he had burned his boats and could never visit there again .
he had treated the S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sk@@ ys just as badly , having left their house without saying good @@@ -@@ @ bye .
that made no difference to him now .
the re@@ arrangement of his farming interested him more than anything had ever done in his life .
political economy maintained that the laws by which the wealth of Europe had developed and is developing are universal and un@@ questionable laws .
the soci@@ alistic teaching declared that development on those lines leads to ruin .
often , just as he was beginning to understand the idea in his interloc@@ utor 's mind and to explain his own , he would suddenly be asked : and what about K@@ au@@ ff@@ mann and Jones , and Du@@ bo@@ is and Michel@@ li ? '
have you not read them ?
he now clearly saw that K@@ au@@ ff@@ mann and Michel@@ li had nothing to tell him .
this he wanted to prove theoretically in his book and practically by his farming .
everything on the estate was going well practically , at least Levin thought so .
but rain set in , making it impossible to get in what remained of the corn and potatoes , stopped all the work , and even prevented the delivery of the wheat .
the mud made the roads im@@ pass@@ able : two mills had been carried away by floods , and the weather was getting worse and worse .
on the thir@@ ti@@ eth of September the sun showed itself in the morning , and , in hopes of fine weather , Levin began seriously preparing for his departure .
notwithstanding the gloomy aspect of nature around him he felt peculi@@ arly el@@ ated .
his conversation with the peasants of the out@@ lying village showed that they were beginning to get used to the new conditions .
an old inn @@@ -@@ @ keeper , into whose house he had gone to dry himself , evidently approved of Levin 's plan and had offered to join a group to buy cattle .
'@@ i need only push on steadily toward my aim and I shall achieve it , ' he thought , ' and it is worth working and striving for .
it is not a personal affair of my own but one of public welfare .
the whole system of farming , and above all the position of the people , must be completely altered : instead of poverty - wealth and satisfaction for all ; instead of hostility - con@@ cord and a bond of common interest .
in a word - a revolution bloo@@ dless but immense ; first in our own small district , then throughout the province , throughout Russia , and the whole world - for a good thought must be fruitful .
yes it is an aim worth working for !
I feel sure that Franklin felt just as insignificant and distr@@ usted himself just as I do when he remembered his past .
he too probably had an Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na to whom he confi@@ ded his secrets . '
with such thoughts Levin reached home when it was already dark .
the ste@@ ward , having been to the merchant , had returned bringing an inst@@ al@@ ment of the money for the wheat .
having d@@ ined , Levin as usual sat down in his easy @@@ -@@ @ chair with a book , and while reading continued to think about his impending journey in connection with the book he was writing .
to @@@ -@@ @ day the importance of his work presented itself to him with especi@@ al clear@@ ness , and whole paragraphs of their own accord shaped themselves in his mind , expressing the g@@ ist of his thoughts .
'@@ i must write that , down , ' thought he . ' that must form a short pre@@ face , such as I formerly considered unnecessary . '
he rose to go to his writing @@@ -@@ @ table , and L@@ aska , who was lying at his feet , stretched herself , also got up , and looked round at him as if asking where she was to go to .
but he had no time to write his thoughts down , for the lab@@ our@@ ers ' fo@@ remen had come , and Levin went into the hall to speak to them .
after arranging about the next day 's work by seeing the peasants who had come on business , Levin went to his study and sat down to his work .
L@@ aska lay down under the table , and Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na with her knit@@ ting sat down in her usual place .
having written for some time , Levin suddenly with particular vivi@@ dness remembered Kit@@ ty , her refusal , and their last meeting .
he rose and began to pace up and down the room .
'@@ What is the use of f@@ ret@@ ting ? ' said Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na . ' why do you always sit at home ?
have you not done enough for the peasants as it is !
'@@ i am not bother@@ ing about them : I am doing it for myself . '
he often laid bare his thoughts before her in all their details , and frequently argued with her and dis@@ agreed with her explanations .
but this time she quite misunderstood what he said .
'@@ i am not speaking about that , ' he said . ' I mean that I am doing it for my own profit .
my gains are bigger when the peasants work better . '
if he has a conscience he will work , if not , you can do nothing with him . '
'@@ But you yourself say that Ivan looks after the cattle better now . '
'@@ i only say , ' answered Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na , evidently not speaking at random but with strict sequence of thought , ' you must marry , that is all ! '
her mention of the very thing he was just thinking about griev@@ ed and hurt him .
he fro@@ w@@ ned , and without repl@@ ying again sat down to his work , repeating to himself all that he had been thinking about its importance .
only occasionally , in the sti@@ ll@@ ness , he listened to the clicking of her needles and , remembering what he did not wish to remember , made a w@@ ry face .
'@@ There now ! visitors have come to you , ' said Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na , rising and going toward the door .
but Levin over@@ took her . his work was not getting on now and he was glad of a visitor , whoever it might be .
Levin was fond of his brother , but to be with him was always a tor@@ ment .
under the sway of the thoughts that had come to him and of Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na 's reminders , he was in an un@@ settled and confused state of mind and the forthcoming meeting with his brother seemed particularly dist@@ ressing .
and that was what he did not desire .
angry with himself for this bad feeling Levin ran into the hall ; and as soon as he had a near view of his brother this feeling of disappointment vanished and was replaced by pity .
dreadful as his em@@ aci@@ ation and illness had previously made Nicholas , he was now still thinner and weaker .
he was a mere skeleton covered with skin .
he stood in the hall jer@@ king his long , thin neck , drawing a scarf from it , and smiling in a strangely pit@@ eous manner .
when he saw this me@@ ek , sub@@ missive smile , Levin felt his throat contract convul@@ sively .
'@@ There ! I have come to see you , ' said Nicholas in a hollow voice , without taking his eyes for an instant from his brother 's face .
he was still more terrified when , kis@@ sing his brother 's face , his lips felt the dr@@ y@@ ness of the skin and he saw his large strangely brilliant eyes close at hand .
Nicholas said that he had now come to fetch that money , but chiefly to visit his own nest and touch his native soil , in order like the heroes of old to gather strength from it for the work that lay before him .
in spite of the fact that he was more round @@@ -@@ @ shoul@@ dered than ever and that , being so tall , his lean@@ ness was startling , his movements were quick and sudden as formerly .
Levin took him to his room .
Nicholas dressed carefully , a thing he never used to do , br@@ ushed his thin , straight hair and went smiling up@@ stairs .
he was in a most aff@@ ection@@ ate and cheerful mood , such as Levin remembered his often being in as a child : and he even mentioned Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich without irritation .
when he met Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na he jo@@ ked with her and questioned her about the other old servants : the news of Par@@ f@@ en Den@@ is@@ ich 's death affected him strangely .
a look of fear appeared on his face but he immediately recovered himself .
'@@ After all , he was old , ' he remarked and changed the subject . ' well , I will spend a month or two with you and then I will go to Moscow .
D '@@ you know , My@@ ag@@ kov has promised me a post and I am entering the Civil Service .
I will now arrange my life quite differently , ' he continued . ' you know , I have got rid of that woman ? '
she has caused me a lot of un@@ pleas@@ ant@@ ness , ' but he did not say in what the un@@ pleas@@ ant@@ ness consisted .
of course , like everybody else , I have done stupid things , but property is the least consideration and I don '@@ t regret mine .
health is the great thing , and my health , thank God , has improved . '
Levin listened , trying but unable to think of what to say .
Nicholas probably felt the same ; he began questioning his brother about his affairs , and Levin was glad to talk about himself because he could do so without any pret@@ ence : he told Nicholas of his plans and activities .
Nicholas listened but evidently was not interested .
these two men were so near akin and so intimate with one another , that between them the least movement or int@@ on@@ ation expressed more than could be said in words .
at present the same thought filled both their minds and dominated all else : Nicholas 's illness and approaching death .
but neither of them dared speak of it , and not having expressed the one thing that occupied their thoughts , whatever they said rang false .
never before had Levin felt so glad when an evening was over and it was time to go to bed .
never had he been so un@@ natural and artificial , even with an out@@ sider or when making a formal call , as he was that day .
and his consciousness of this artif@@ ici@@ ality and his repentance made him more un@@ natural .
he wished to we@@ ep over his dear , dying brother , but had to listen and keep up a conversation about how Nicholas was going to live .
the house being damp , and only his bedroom heated , Levin put his brother to sleep behind a partition in that room .
Nicholas went to bed but , whether he slept or not , kept tos@@ sing and c@@ ough@@ ing like a sick man and , when unable to clear his throat , mut@@ tering some complaint .
sometimes he sigh@@ ed deeply and said , ' Oh , my God ! '
sometimes , when the ph@@ leg@@ m cho@@ ked him , he mut@@ tered an@@ gr@@ ily , ' Oh , the devil ! '
Levin long lay awake listening to him .
his thoughts were very various , but they all led up to death .
death , the inevitable end of everything , confronted him for the first time with irresisti@@ ble force .
and that Death which was present in this dear brother ( who , waking up , mo@@ an@@ ed and by habit called in@@ discrimin@@ ately on God and on the devil ) was not so far away as it had hitherto seemed to be .
it was within himself too he felt it .
if not to @@@ -@@ @ day , then to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row or thirty years hence , was it not all the same ?
but what that inevitable Death was , he not only did not know , not only had never considered , but could not and dared not consider .
'@@ i am working , I want to do something , and I had forgotten that it will all end in Death ! '
he sat on his bed in the dark , doubled his arms round his knees and thought , scarcely breathing from the mental strain .
he lit a candle , got up carefully , went to the looking @@@ -@@ @ glass , and began examining his face and hair .
yes ! there were grey ha@@ irs on his temples .
he b@@ ared his muscular arms .
yes , he was very strong .
'@@ And now that sunk and hollow chest ... And I , who do not know what will happen to me , or why ... '
why don '@@ t you sleep ? ' his brother 's voice called to him .
'@@ Oh , I don '@@ t know , just sle@@ epl@@ essness . '
'@@ And I have slept well ; I don '@@ t per@@ sp@@ ire now .
see , feel my shirt , it 's not damp ! '
Levin felt it , returned behind the partition , and put out the candle , but was long unable to sleep .
just when the question of how to live had become a little clearer to him , a new in@@ soluble problem presented itself - Death .
'@@ Well , he is dying , he will die before spring . how can he be helped ?
what can I say to him ?
what do I know about it ?
I had forgotten there was such a thing ! '
Levin H@@ AD LO@@ NG AG@@ O noticed that after people have made one uncomfortable by their pli@@ ancy and sub@@ mis@@ siveness they soon become un@@ bear@@ ably exac@@ ting and aggressive .
he felt that this would happen with his brother .
and really Nicholas 's me@@ ek@@ ness did not last long .
the very next morning he grew irrit@@ able and cav@@ illed at everything his brother said , touching his most sensitive spots .
Levin felt guilty but could do nothing .
that was all they would say if only they spoke straight from the heart .
on the third day of his stay Nicholas challenged his brother to explain his plans to him once more , and not only found fault with them but purpos@@ ely confused them with communism .
'@@ But I tell you that the two things have nothing in common !
'@@ But my idea has nothing in common ... '
'@@ That idea , ' said Nicholas Levin with a sar@@ cas@@ tic smile and an@@ gr@@ ily g@@ listening eyes , ' that idea at any rate , if one may say so , has a geometric charm of defin@@ it@@ eness and certainty .
it may be utop@@ ian ; but granting the possibility of making a tab@@ ula r@@ asa of the past - and abol@@ ishing private property and families - then labour comes by its own . but you have nothing ... '
'@@ Why do you mud@@ dle it ? I never was a communist . '
'@@ But I have been , and now I think it is premature but reasonable , and that it has a future as Christianity had in the first centuries . '
'@@ i only think that the force of labour must be dealt with in a scientifically experimental manner . it must be studied and its characteristics ... '
'@@ But that is quite unnecessary !
that force finds its own form of activity in accord with its degree of development .
there used to be slaves everywhere , then vil@@ le@@ ins ; and we have labour paid in kind , and le@@ as@@ e@@ holders , and hired labour : so what are you looking for ? '
at these words Levin suddenly grew warm , for at the bottom of his heart he felt that it was true - true that he wished to balance between communism and the existing forms of life , and that this was hardly possible .
'@@ i want to establish ... '
'@@ You do not want to establish anything . you simply want to be original , as you always have done , and to show that you are not just exploiting the peasants , but have ideas ! '
'@@ You think so ? well , then , leave me alone ! ' said Levin , and he felt that a muscle was un@@ control@@ l@@ ably qui@@ vering in his left cheek .
'@@ You have no convictions and never had any ; you only want to fl@@ atter your self @@@ -@@ @ esteem . '
'@@ Well , all right ! but leave me alone . '
you can go to the devil !
and I am sorry I came ! '
however much Levin tried afterwards to paci@@ fy his brother , Nicholas would not listen to it , but said that it was much better for them to part . and Levin saw that life had become simply intolerable for his brother .
Nicholas had quite made up his mind to go . Constan@@ tine came to him again and in an un@@ natural manner asked his forgiveness if he had offended him in any way .
'@@ ah , this is mag@@ n@@ anim@@ ity ! ' said Nicholas , and smiled . ' if you wish to be in the right , I can let you have that pleasure .
only just before he left Nicholas kis@@ sed Constan@@ tine , and suddenly said with a strange and serious look at his brother ,
'@@ Do not think too badly of me , Ko@@ st@@ ya ! ' and his voice trem@@ bled .
these were the only sincere words that had passed between them .
Levin understood that they were meant to say , ' You see that I am in a bad way , and perhaps we shall not meet again . '
he understood this , and tears trem@@ bled in his eyes .
he again kis@@ sed his brother , but he did not know what to answer .
three days after his brother 's departure Levin left for abroad .
he surprised young Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky , Kit@@ ty 's cousin , whom he happened to meet at a railway station , by his mor@@ os@@ eness .
'@@ What is the matter with you ? ' asked Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky .
'@@ Little ? you 'd better come to Paris with me instead of going to some Mul@@ hausen or other .
'@@ That is a fine thing ! ' said Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky , laughing . ' I am only preparing to begin to live . '
'@@ Yes , I thought so too till lately ; but now I know that I shall soon die . '
Levin was saying what of late he had really been thinking .
he saw death and the approach of death in everything ; but the work he had begun interested him all the more .
after all , he had to live his life somehow , till death came .
the K@@ aren@@ ins , husband AND W@@ IF@@ E , continued to live in the same house and to meet daily , but they were wholly e@@ strang@@ ed .
K@@ aren@@ in made it a rule to see his wife every day , so as not to give the servants any grounds for making con@@ jec@@ tures , but he avoided dining at home .
V@@ ron@@ sky never came to the K@@ aren@@ ins ' house , but Anna met him elsewhere and her husband knew it .
K@@ aren@@ in expected the passion to pass , as everything passes ; all would be forgotten and his name not dis@@ honoured .
she had not the least idea what would settle it , but was quite certain that it would now come very soon .
involun@@ tarily submitting to her judgment , V@@ ron@@ sky too expected something , not dependent on him , to clear up all these difficulties .
in the middle of the winter he spent a very dull week .
he had been chosen to act as guide to a foreign Prince , and was obliged to show him the sights of Petersburg .
in the mor@@ nings they went sight @@@ -@@ @ seeing , and in the evenings took part in the national amus@@ ements .
he had been to Spain , where he arranged ser@@ en@@ ades and became intimate with a Spanish woman who played the man@@ dol@@ ine .
in Switzerland he had shot a cham@@ ois , in England he had jumped h@@ edges in a pink coat and shot two hundred phe@@ as@@ ants for a bet .
he had been in a ha@@ re@@ m in Turkey , ridden an elephant in India , and now in Russia he wanted a taste of distinctive Russian amus@@ ements .
but , on the whole , of all the Russian amus@@ ements the Prince liked the French actresses , a ballet girl , and white @@@ -@@ @ seal champagne best .
he was obliged to be on his guard the whole time not to devi@@ ate from the path of severe official respect , for fear of being insul@@ ted .
the Prince 's manner toward the very people who , to V@@ ron@@ sky 's aston@@ ishment , were ready to go through fire and water to provide Russian amus@@ ements for him , was cont@@ emp@@ tuous .
his opinion of Russian women , whom he wanted to study , more than once made V@@ ron@@ sky flush with indignation .
but the chief reason why the Prince 's presence oppressed V@@ ron@@ sky was that he saw himself reflected in the Prince , and what he saw in that mirror was not fl@@ attering to his van@@ ity .
the Prince was a very stupid , very healthy and very clean@@ ly man - and nothing more .
he was a gentleman , it is true , and V@@ ron@@ sky could not deny it .
he was quiet and not cr@@ inging with those above him , free and simple with his equals , and cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ously good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured with his inferi@@ ors .
V@@ ron@@ sky was the same , and considered it very merit@@ orious to be so , but in his relations with the Prince he was the inferior and felt indig@@ n@@ ant with that con@@ desc@@ end@@ ingly good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured treatment .
'@@ Stu@@ pid ox ! can I really be like that myself ? ' he thought .
on returning HO@@ ME V@@ ron@@ sky found a note from Anna awaiting him .
she wrote , ' I am ill and unhappy .
I C@@ AN@@ NOT go out , neither can I go on any longer without seeing you .
come this evening ; Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich is going to the Council and will remain there till ten . '
after wondering for a moment at the strang@@ eness of her asking him straight out to come to her house in spite of her husband 's inj@@ unc@@ tions , he decided to go .
he had that winter been promoted to the rank of colonel , had left the regiment , and was living alone .
he woke up in the dark trembling with fear , and hur@@ ri@@ edly lit a candle .
yes , yes , the peasant , the be@@ ater - I think he was small and dirty with a t@@ angled beard - was sto@@ oping down and doing something or other , and suddenly began to say strange words in French .
that is all there was in that dream , ' he thought . ' but why did it seem so terrible ? '
he vivi@@ dly recalled the peasant and the incomprehensible words that the man had uttered , and a sh@@ ud@@ der of terror ran down his back .
'@@ What nonsense ! ' he thought , gl@@ ancing at his watch .
it was already half past eight .
he rang for his val@@ et , dressed hur@@ ri@@ edly , and went out into the por@@ ch , having quite forgotten his dream and feeling worried only by the fact that he was late .
as he drove up to the K@@ aren@@ ins ' por@@ ch he again glanced at his watch and saw that it was ten minutes to nine .
a high narrow br@@ ou@@ g@@ ham with a pair of grey horses stood before the front door .
'@@ She was coming to me , ' thought V@@ ron@@ sky ; ' that would have been better .
it is unpleasant for me to enter this house .
but no matter ! I C@@ AN@@ NOT hide , ' he thought ; and with the manner ; habitual to him since childhood , of one who has nothing to be ashamed of , V@@ ron@@ sky got out of his sle@@ dge and went to the door .
the door opened and the hall porter with a rug over his arm called to the co@@ ach@@ man .
V@@ ron@@ sky , though not in the habit of noticing details , noticed the look of surprise on the man 's face .
in the doorway he nearly knocked up against K@@ aren@@ in .
the gas@@ light lit up K@@ aren@@ in 's worn , bloo@@ dless face beneath the black hat , and his white tie showing from beneath the be@@ aver collar of his over@@ coat .
his dull , expres@@ sion@@ less eyes were fixed on V@@ ron@@ sky 's face .
V@@ ron@@ sky bowed , and K@@ aren@@ in silently moved his lips , lifted his hand to his hat , and went out .
V@@ ron@@ sky saw him get into the carriage without looking round , take the rug and a pair of opera @@@ -@@ @ glasses through the carriage window ; then he disappeared in the darkness .
V@@ ron@@ sky entered the hall .
his brows were knit and his eyes shone with a proud , angry light .
'@@ That is a nice position ! ' he thought . ' if he struggled , if he defended his honour , I could act and could express my feelings ; but this weakness or mean@@ ness ...
he puts me in the position of an im@@ post@@ or - which I did not and do not mean to be . '
since the explanation with Anna in the V@@ re@@ de Gardens V@@ ron@@ sky 's ideas had changed .
while still in the hall he heard her retre@@ ating footsteps , and knew that she had been waiting and listening for him , but had now gone back to the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room .
'@@ no ! ' she cried when she saw him , and at the first sound of her voice tears filled her eyes . ' no ! if things go on like this for long , it will happen much , much sooner ! '
no , no ! I won '@@ t ! ...
I C@@ AN@@ NOT quarrel with you .
I expect you could not help it .
she put both her hands on his shoulders and gaz@@ ed at him long , with a deep look of ecstasy and yet search@@ ingly .
she compared , as she did at every interview with him , the image her fancy painted of him ( in@@ compar@@ ably fin@@ er than , and impossible in , actual existence ) with his real self .
he had to be at the Council ! '
'@@ He had been and had come back , and afterwards went somewhere else .
but never mind : Don '@@ t speak about it .
he wished to say that he had been up all night and had fallen asleep , but seeing her excited and happy face he felt ashamed .
so he said that he had to go and report the Prince 's departure .
'@@ But now that is all over ?
you would hardly believe how intolerable it was . '
she held her work in her hands , without cro@@ ch@@ eting , gaz@@ ing at him with a strange , glit@@ tering , un@@ friendly look .
'@@ Lisa called on me this morning ; they still visit me in spite of the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna , ' she said , ' and she told me about your Ath@@ en@@ ian party .
how disgu@@ sting ! '
'@@ i was only going to say that ... '
'@@ It was Ther@@ ese , whom you knew before ? '
'@@ i was going to say ... '
'@@ How hor@@ rid you men are !
how is it that you can forget that a woman C@@ AN@@ NOT forget these things ? ' she said , getting more and more heated and thereby betr@@ aying the cause of her irritation . ' especially a woman who C@@ AN@@ NOT know your life .
have I not told you that I have not a thought that I would hide from you ? '
'@@ Yes ; yes ! ' she said , evidently trying to drive away her jeal@@ ous thoughts . ' but if you only knew how hard it is for me !
but he could not at once remember what he had wished to say .
then he thought himself unhappy , but happiness was all in the future ; now he felt that the best happiness was already in the past .
she was not at all such as he had first seen her .
both morally and physically she had changed for the worse .
she had broad@@ ened out , and as she spoke of the actress there was a mal@@ evolent look on her face which distorted its expression .
he looked at her as a man might look at a faded flower he had pl@@ ucked , in which it was difficult for him to trace the beauty that had made him pick and so destroy it .
'@@ Well , what were you going to tell me about the Prince ?
they spoke of jealousy as ' the demon . ' ' yes , what had you begun telling me about the Prince ?
'@@ Oh , it was intolerable ! ' he said , trying to pick up the lost thread of what he had in his mind . ' he does not improve on nearer acquaintance .
if I am to describe him , he is a fin@@ ely @@@ -@@ @ bred animal , like those that get prizes at cattle @@@ -@@ @ shows , and nothing more , ' he concluded in a tone of v@@ ex@@ ation which aw@@ oke her interest .
one can see that he has been educated only to have the right to desp@@ ise education , as they desp@@ ise everything except animal pleasures . '
'@@ But don '@@ t all of you like those animal pleasures ? ' she remarked , and he again noticed on her face that dismal look which ev@@ aded his .
'@@ Why do you take his part so ? ' he said , smiling .
'@@ i don '@@ t take his part , and it is a matter of complete indifference to me , but I should say that as you did not like these pleasures you might have declined to go .
but it gives you pleasure to see Ther@@ ese dressed as Eve ... '
'@@ Again ! again the demon ! ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , taking the hand which she had put on the table , and kis@@ sing it .
you don '@@ t know how I have suffered while waiting for you !
I don '@@ t think I have a jeal@@ ous nature .
I am not jeal@@ ous ; I trust you when you are here near me ; but when you are away , living your life , which I don '@@ t understand ... '
'@@ Well , and what happened ? where did you meet Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich ? ' she suddenly asked , her voice ringing un@@ naturally .
'@@ And he bowed like this to you ? '
she drew up her face , half closed her eyes and quickly changed the expression of her face , folding her hands ; and V@@ ron@@ sky saw at once upon her beautiful face the very look with which K@@ aren@@ in had bowed to him .
he smiled , and she laughed mer@@ r@@ ily , with that delightful laughter from the chest which was one of her special char@@ ms .
'@@ He ? ' she said , sar@@ cas@@ tically . ' he is perfectly cont@@ ented . '
'@@ Why are we all tor@@ m@@ enting each other when everything might be so comfortable ? '
'@@ But not he !
as if I did not know him , and the false@@ hood with which he is saturated ! ...
as if it were possible for anyone to live as he is living with me !
could a man who has any feelings live in the same house with his guilty wife ?
could he talk to her and call her by her Christian name ? '
and without meaning to , she again mim@@ icked him : ' Ma ch@@ è@@ re Anna ; my dear ! '
Oh , if I were he , I should long since have killed , have torn in pieces , a wife such as I , and not have called her " Ma ch@@ è@@ re Anna . "
he is not a man but an official machine .
he does not understand that I am your wife , that he is a stranger , a super@@ flu@@ ous@@ .@@ -@@ .@@ -@@ . But don '@@ t let us talk about him . '
'@@ You are unjust , unjust , my dear , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , trying to paci@@ fy her . ' but still , don '@@ t let us talk about him .
tell me what you have been doing ?
she looked at him with qu@@ iz@@ z@@ ical joy .
she had evidently remembered other com@@ ical and unpleasant sides of her husband 's character and waited for an opportunity to mention them .
'@@ i expect it is not illness at all , but only your condition .
the mo@@ cking light in her eyes faded , but a smile of a different kind - the knowledge of something unknown to him , and gentle sadness - replaced the former expression of her face .
you were saying that our position was full of tor@@ ment and should be put an end to .
if you only knew how hard it is on me ! what would I not give to be able to love you freely and boldly !
I should not be tortured , I would not tor@@ ment you with my jealousy ...
it will happen soon , but not in the way you think . '
and at the thought of how it was going to happen she felt so sorry for herself that the tears came into her eyes and she could not continue .
she laid her hand , sparkling with rings and the whit@@ eness of the skin , on his sleeve .
I did not want to tell you , but you make me do it .
soon , very soon , everything will get dis@@ ent@@ angled and we shall be able to rest and not tor@@ ment each other any more . '
'@@ i do not understand , ' he said , though he did understand .
'@@ You were asking when ?
soon , and I shall not survive it .
Don '@@ t interrupt , ' she said hur@@ ri@@ edly . ' I shall die and I am very glad that I shall die : I shall find deliver@@ ance and deliver you . '
'@@ That is right , that is better , ' she said , firmly pressing his hand . ' this is all , all that remains to us . '
he recovered and lifted his head .
'@@ What rub@@ bish , what senseless rub@@ bish you are talking ! '
'a dream ? ' V@@ ron@@ sky instantly remembered the peasant of his dream .
'@@ Oh , what nonsense !
but she would not allow him to stop her .
what she was saying was of too much importance to her .
'@@ And that something turned round , and I saw it was a peasant with a rough beard , small and dreadful .
I wanted to run away , but he sto@@ op@@ ed over a sack and was f@@ um@@ bling about in it ... '
she showed how he f@@ um@@ bled in the sack : her face was full of horror .
and V@@ ron@@ sky , remembering his dream , felt the same horror filling his soul .
'@@ He f@@ um@@ bles about and mut@@ ters French words , so quickly , so quickly , and with a bur@@ r , you know : " Il f@@ aut le b@@ attr@@ e , le fer : Le bro@@ yer , le p@@ é@@ tri@@ r ... "
[ it must be beaten , the iron : pound it , kne@@ ad it . ]
then I woke . '
'@@ What nonsense , what nonsense ! ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , but he felt that there was no conviction in his voice .
ring the bell , I will order tea .
but wait , it won '@@ t be long and I ... '
the expression of her face changed instantane@@ ously .
the horror and agitation were replaced by an expression of quiet , serious , and blis@@ s@@ ful attention .
he could not understand the meaning of this change .
she had felt a new life quick@@ ening within her .
K@@ aren@@ in AF@@ TER ME@@ ET@@ ING V@@ ron@@ sky in his own por@@ ch went on as had been his intention to the Italian Opera .
he sat through the first two acts and saw everybody that it was necessary for him to see .
she had not fulfilled his condition and he was obliged to punish her and carry out his threat : to divorce her and take away her son .
he knew the difficulties connected with such a step : but he had said he would do it and was now obliged to do it .
he did not sleep at all , and his wrath , increasing in a kind of gigantic progression , had reached its utmost limits by the morning .
Anna , who thought that she knew her husband so well , was struck by his appearance when he entered .
his bro@@ w was knit , and his eyes , glo@@ om@@ ily fixed before him , avoided looking at her ; his lips were firmly and cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ously closed .
in his step , his movements , and the sound of his voice was such determination and firm@@ ness as his wife had never known in him .
he entered her bou@@ do@@ ir and without saying ' Good morning ! ' went straight to her writing @@@ -@@ @ table , took up her keys , and opened the draw@@ er .
'@@ S@@ it down ! I must speak to you , ' he said , taking the letter @@@ -@@ @ case under his arm and pressing it so tight with his el@@ bow that his shoulder went up .
astonished and ab@@ ashed , she silently looked at him .
'@@ i told you that I would not allow you to see your lover here . '
'@@ i wanted to see him in order ... '
she paused , unable to invent a reason .
'@@ i wanted , I only wanted ... ' she said , fl@@ ushing .
his co@@ arsen@@ ess irrit@@ ated her and gave her bold@@ ness . ' is it possible you do not feel how easy it is for you to insult me ? ' she said .
'@@ i have not seen this new trait of cruelty in you before . '
'@@ You call it cruelty when a husband gives his wife complete freedom while he affor@@ ds her hon@@ our@@ able shelter , on the one condition that she should observe the laws of propri@@ ety .
'@@ It is worse than cruelty , it is - bas@@ eness , if you want to know ! ' Anna exclaimed in a burst of anger , and rose to go .
'@@ Bas@@ eness ?
since you wish to use that word - it is bas@@ eness to abandon a husband and a son for a lover and to go on eating the husband 's bread ! '
she did not say what she had said to her lover the day before , that V@@ ron@@ sky was her real husband and that he ( K@@ aren@@ in ) was super@@ flu@@ ous , she did not even think it .
she felt all the justice of his words and only said softly :
'@@ You C@@ AN@@ NOT describe my position as being worse than I know it to be , but why do you tell me all this ? '
'@@ So@@ on , very soon , it will come to an end of itself ! ' she mut@@ tered , and at the thought of the near@@ ness of death , which she now desired , tears again filled her eyes .
'@@ It will end sooner than you and your lover imagine !
you want to satisfy animal passions ... '
'@@ Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich !
this is not only un@@ generous , but not even gentl@@ eman@@ ly - to hit one who is down . '
'@@ That 's all very well , but you think only of yourself ! the sufferings of the man who was your husband do not interest you . what do you care that his whole life is wrec@@ ked and how much he has su@@ f ... su@@ f ... suff@@ led ! '
K@@ aren@@ in was speaking so rapidly that he bl@@ under@@ ed and could not pron@@ ounce the word , and at last said suff@@ led .
that struck her as funny ; but immediately after she felt ashamed that anything could seem funny to her at such a moment .
and for the first time she felt for him and put herself for an instant in his place , and was sorry for him .
but what could she say or do ?
he too was silent for a while and then again began in a less sque@@ ak@@ y voice , col@@ dly emphasizing certain chance words that had no special importance .
'@@ i came to tell you ... ' said he .
'@@ i C@@ AN@@ NOT change anything , ' she whispered .
'@@ i have come to tell you that I am going to Moscow tomorrow and shall not return to this house again , and that you will hear my decision through the lawyer whom I shall employ in the divorce suit .
my son will stay with my sister , ' said K@@ aren@@ in , making an effort to remember what he had wanted to say about his son .
'@@ You want Ser@@ ez@@ ha in order to hurt me , ' she said , looking at him from under her brows . ' you do not care for him ...
" yes , I have even lost my affection for my son , because he is connected with my re@@ pulsion for you . but all the same I shall take him away .
and he was about to go , but now she stopped him .
I shall soon be confined , leave him ! '
K@@ aren@@ in fl@@ ushed , and pulling away his hand left the room .
the F@@ AM@@ O@@ US PE@@ TER@@ SB@@ UR@@ G lawyer 'S waiting @@@ -@@ @ room was full when K@@ aren@@ in entered it .
the writing @@@ -@@ @ table accessories ( of which K@@ aren@@ in was a con@@ nois@@ se@@ ur ) were unusually good , as he could not help noticing .
one of the cler@@ ks , without rising from his chair , scre@@ wed up his eyes and addressed K@@ aren@@ in ill @@@ -@@ @ hum@@ ou@@ re@@ dly .
'@@ the lawyer is engaged , ' replied the assistant ster@@ nly , and indicated with his pen the persons who were waiting .
'@@ Can he not find time to see me ? ' said K@@ aren@@ in .
'@@ Then I will trouble you to give him my card , ' said K@@ aren@@ in with dignity , seeing the impossibility of preserving his in@@ cog@@ ni@@ to .
his whole life had been spent in administrative activity , and therefore when he dis@@ approved of anything his dis@@ approval was mitigated by a recognition of the inev@@ itability of mistakes and the possibility of improvement in everything .
in the new legal institutions he dis@@ approved of the position occupied by lawyers .
but till now he had never had to deal with a lawyer and so had dis@@ approved only in theory ; now his dis@@ approval was strengthened by the unpleasant impression he received in the lawyer 's waiting @@@ -@@ @ room .
his face was intelligent and peasant @@@ -@@ @ like , but his dress was dan@@ di@@ fied and in bad taste .
'@@ Come in , please ! ' said the lawyer to K@@ aren@@ in , and glo@@ om@@ ily us@@ her@@ ing his client in before him , he closed the door .
'@@ W@@ on '@@ t you take a seat ? ' he pointed to a chair beside a writing @@@ -@@ @ table covered with papers , and himself took the principal seat , rubbing his little hands with their short fingers covered with white hair and bending his head to one side .
but hardly had he settled down when a moth flew across the table .
the lawyer , with a rap@@ idity one could not have expected of him , separated his hands , caught the moth , and resumed his former position .
a scarcely percep@@ tible smile moved the lawyer 's dro@@ oping red@@ dish mou@@ st@@ ache .
'@@ i should not be a lawyer if I could not keep the secrets entrusted to me !
K@@ aren@@ in glanced at him and saw that his intelligent grey eyes were laughing , as if he knew everything in advance .
'@@ You know my name ? ' continued K@@ aren@@ in .
'@@ i know you and , like every Russian , I know - ' here he again caught a moth - ' your useful activity , ' said the lawyer b@@ owing .
K@@ aren@@ in sigh@@ ed , collecting his courage , but having once made up his mind he went on in his sque@@ ak@@ y voice without tim@@ idity or hesitation , emphasizing a word here and there .
'@@ i have the mis@@ fortune , ' began K@@ aren@@ in , ' to be a deceived husband , and I wish legally to break off relations with my wife - that is , to be divorced , but in such a way that my son should not remain with his mother . '
'@@ You want my assistance to obtain a divorce ? '
'@@ Just so ! but I must warn you that there is a risk that I may be wasting your time .
I have come only for a preliminary consultation .
I wish for a divorce , but the form in which it can be obtained is of importance to me .
it is quite possible that if the forms do not coincide with my requirements I shall for@@ go my legitimate desire . '
'@@ Oh , that is always so , ' said the lawyer , ' that is always open to you . '
the lawyer looked down at K@@ aren@@ in 's feet , feeling that the sight of his irre@@ pres@@ sible joy might offend his client .
he glanced at a moth that flew past his nose and his hand moved , but did not catch it , out of respect for K@@ aren@@ in 's situation .
'@@ Although the general outline of our laws relating to this matter is known to me , ' continued K@@ aren@@ in , ' I should like to know the forms in which such cases are conducted in practice . '
and on K@@ aren@@ in 's nod@@ ding affirm@@ atively the lawyer continued , only occasionally casting a glance at K@@ aren@@ in 's face , which had grown red in patches .
'@@ Div@@ or@@ ce , under our laws , ' he said , with a slight shade of dis@@ approval of the laws , ' as you are aware , may be granted in the following cases ...
therefore , guided by the precedents , I have to inform you that cases of divorce all come to the following : - there is , I suppose , no physical defect or absence without news ? ... '
K@@ aren@@ in nodded affirm@@ atively .
'@@ - come to the following : adul@@ tery of husband or wife and the detection of the guilty party by mutual consent , or involun@@ tary detection without such consent .
but K@@ aren@@ in remained silent , and so he began again : ' the most usual , simple , and reasonable way I consider to be adul@@ tery by mutual consent .
I should not venture so to express myself were I talking to a man of un@@ developed mind , ' said the lawyer , ' but I expect it is comprehensible to you . '
K@@ aren@@ in was , however , so much upset that he did not at once understand the reason@@ abl@@ eness of adul@@ tery by mutual consent and his perpl@@ ex@@ ity was expressed in his looks ; but the lawyer immediately helped him .
'@@ Two people can no longer live together - there is the fact . and if both agree about that , the details and form@@ alities become un@@ important , and at the same time it is the simplest and su@@ rest method . '
but he had religious requirements which hindered his acceptance of this method .
'@@ It is out of the question in the present case , ' said he . ' only one measure is possible : involun@@ tary detection confirmed by letters which I have . '
in general , if you do me the honour to entr@@ ust the case to me , leave me to choose the means which should be used .
'@@ If it is so ... ' K@@ aren@@ in began , growing suddenly pale ; but at that moment the other suddenly rose and went to the door to speak to his assistant , who had again come to interrupt him .
'@@ Tell her we have not got a cheap sale on here ! ' he said and came back again .
as he was returning he fur@@ tively caught another moth .
'a fine state my furniture will be in when summer comes ! ' he thought , and fro@@ w@@ ned .
'@@ Yes , you were saying ... ' he began
'@@ i will write and let you know what I decide , ' said K@@ aren@@ in , rising and holding on by the table .
after a short pause he said , ' I may conclude from your words that a divorce could be obtained .
I would also ask you to let me know your terms ? '
'@@ in a week 's time .
'@@ Very well . '
the lawyer bowed de@@ fer@@ entially , let his client pass out , and being left alone abandoned himself to his happy mood .
K@@ aren@@ in H@@ AD gained a brilliant victory at the Committee Meeting of the seventeenth of August ; but the consequence of that victory undermined his power .
three months later the committee sent in its report .
the subject @@@ -@@ @ races ' conditions had been investigated from the political , administrative , economic , ethno@@ graphical , material , and religious points of view .
all the questions had received splen@@ di@@ dly @@@ -@@ @ drafted answers : answers not open to doubts since they were not the result of human thoughts ( always liable to error ) , but were the outcome of official lab@@ ours .
and the solutions arrived at were in accord with K@@ aren@@ in 's opinions .
but St@@ remo@@ v , who had been touched to the quick at the last meeting , made use of tactics for which K@@ aren@@ in was not prepared .
these measures , going beyond K@@ aren@@ in 's original idea , were accepted , and then St@@ remo@@ v 's tactics became manifest .
St@@ remo@@ v stood aside , pretending to have blind@@ ly followed K@@ aren@@ in 's plans and to be himself indig@@ n@@ ant now at what had been done , thus undermining K@@ aren@@ in .
but , in spite of failing health and family troubles , K@@ aren@@ in did not give in .
K@@ aren@@ in and a number of others saw danger in so revolutionary an attitude toward official documents and continued to support the data presented by the Committee .
in consequence , the higher circles and even Society became quite confused and , though everybody was deeply interested in the question , no one could make out whether the subject @@@ -@@ @ races were really suffering and per@@ ishing or were flourishing .
in these circumstances he took an important resolution .
he announced , to the surprise of the Committee , that he would ask to be allowed to go and investigate the matter himself , and having received permission he started for the distant Prov@@ in@@ ces .
'@@ i consider it very fine of him , ' the Princess Bet@@ sy said , referring to it in a conversation with Princess My@@ ag@@ k@@ aya . ' why should they pay for post @@@ -@@ @ horses when everybody knows that we now have railways everywhere ? '
but the Princess My@@ ag@@ k@@ aya did not agree , and was even irrit@@ ated by Princess T@@ ver@@ skaya 's views .
'@@ It is all very well for you to talk who possess I don '@@ t know how many millions , ' she said . ' but I am very glad when my husband goes on inspection @@@ -@@ @ tours in summer .
it is very good for his health , and pleasant for him ; and we have an arrangement by which this allowance goes for the hire of a carriage and co@@ ach@@ man for me . '
on his way to the distant Province K@@ aren@@ in stopped three days in Moscow .
on the day after his arrival he went to call on the Governor @@@ -@@ @ General .
at the crossing of Gaz@@ et@@ ny Street , where there is always a crowd of carriages and iz@@ v@@ osh@@ chi@@ ks , he suddenly heard some one calling out his name in such a loud and cheerful voice that he could not help looking round .
the lady too with a kind smile wav@@ ed her hand to K@@ aren@@ in .
the lady with the children was Dol@@ ly .
K@@ aren@@ in did not wish to see anyone in Moscow , and certainly not his wife 's brother .
he raised his hat and was going on , but O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky told the co@@ ach@@ man to stop and ran across the snow .
'@@ What a shame not to have sent word !
I am so glad to see you ! ' and he kicked his feet together to knock off the snow . ' what a shame not to send word ! '
'@@ i could not find time : I am very busy , ' K@@ aren@@ in answered dr@@ ily .
'@@ Come and speak to my wife ; she is so anxious to see you . '
K@@ aren@@ in unfol@@ ded the rug he had wrapped round his legs , which were so sensitive to the cold , got out of the carriage , and making his way through the snow approached Dol@@ ly .
'@@ What is the matter , Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich ? why do you avoid us in this way ? ' Dol@@ ly smil@@ ingly asked .
'@@ i was exceedingly busy !
very pleased to see you , ' he said in a tone that expressed clearly that he was very sorry . ' how are you ? '
K@@ aren@@ in mut@@ tered something and was about to go , when O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky stopped him .
'd '@@ you know what we 'll do to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row ?
'@@ Yes , do come ! ' said Dol@@ ly . ' we shall expect you at five or six , just as you like .
'@@ She is well , ' replied K@@ aren@@ in , fro@@ w@@ ning . ' I shall be very pleased , ' and he went back to his carriage .
K@@ aren@@ in mut@@ tered something which Dol@@ ly could not catch amid the noise of passing vehicles .
K@@ aren@@ in got into his carriage and sat far back , so as neither to see nor to be seen .
'@@ Que@@ er cha@@ p ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky to his wife , and after gl@@ ancing at his watch wav@@ ed his hand in front of his face as a sign of ende@@ ar@@ ment to his wife and children , and walked ja@@ unti@@ ly away along the pav@@ ement .
he turned round .
'@@ You know that I must buy coats for G@@ ris@@ ha and T@@ anya .
give me some money . '
'@@ Never mind ! tell them I will pay ! ' and nod@@ ding his head to an acquaintance who was driving past he disappeared round the corner .
the NE@@ XT DA@@ Y W@@ AS S@@ UN@@ DA@@ Y .
besides giving her the nec@@ klace he wished to make an appointment to meet her after the ballet .
having explained that he could not be there at the beginning of the performance , he promised to come for the last act , and take her to sup@@ per .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky liked a good dinner , but liked still more giving a dinner @@@ -@@ @ party : not a big affair , but one select in food , drink , and guests .
he was in very high spirits .
just two circumstances were not quite satisfactory , but they were drowned in the ocean of kind @@@ -@@ @ hearted jo@@ vi@@ ality which over@@ flowed his heart .
on the previous day O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky had appeared on Service business in uniform ; the new superior was very pleasant and chat@@ ted with him as with an old acquaintance ; therefore O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky now considered it his duty to call on him in a morning coat .
the thought that the new superior might not take this in good part was the second unpleasant circumstance , but O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky felt instinc@@ tively that everything would ' turn out ' splen@@ di@@ dly .
'@@ After all , they 're all human beings , all men , just like us poor sinners , ' he thought , as he entered the hotel . ' what is there to be angry and quarrel about ? '
'@@ You 've grown whis@@ kers !
will you show me the way ? and please find out whether Count An@@ ich@@ kin ' ( the new superior ) ' will receive me . '
'@@ Yes , sir , ' replied V@@ ass@@ ily with a smile .
he shook hands with the peasant and sat down without taking off his over@@ coat or hat .
'@@ no , I have no time . I 've only come in for a moment , ' replied O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , throwing open his coat .
later on he took it off and stayed for an hour , talking to Levin about bear @@@ -@@ @ hunting and also about personal matters .
'@@ Now please tell me what you did abroad , and where you have been , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , when the peasant had left .
'@@ Well , I stayed in Germany , in Prussia , in France , and in England - not in the capitals but in manufacturing centres .
'@@ Not at all ! in Russia there C@@ AN@@ NOT be a working @@@ -@@ @ class problem .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky listened to Levin with attention .
'@@ Well , what of that ? I never stop thinking of death , ' said Levin .
'@@ It really is time for me to die .
'@@ It is old ... But , do you know , when you have once grasped it clearly , everything becomes so insignificant !
I consider my ideas very important , yet they too turn out to be insignificant - and would be , even if it were as possible to carry them out as it was to surround this bear .
and so one passes one 's life finding distraction in hunting or in work , merely not to think of death . '
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky listened to Levin with an aff@@ ection@@ ate and subtle smile .
'@@ Well , of course !
so now you have come round to my notion .
do you remember how you used to fly at me for seeking enjoyment in life ?
do not be so severe , O mor@@ alist ! ... '
'@@ And do you know , life has less charm when one thinks of death , but it is more peaceful . '
however , I must be going , ' returned O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , rising for the tenth time .
'@@ Don '@@ t go yet ! ' said Levin , trying to det@@ ain him . ' when shall we meet again ?
'@@ Well , I 'm a good one !
'@@ is he here ? ' asked Levin , and was going to inqu@@ ire about Kit@@ ty .
'@@ Then you will come ? '
'@@ Yes , of course . '
'@@ Well , then , at five , and in morning dress ! '
and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky got up and went down@@ stairs to call on the new superior .
his instinct had not deceived him ; the dreadful new superior turned out to be a most aff@@ able man . O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky had lunch with him and sat talking so long that it was going on for four when he arrived at K@@ aren@@ in 's .
K@@ aren@@ in , AF@@ TER returning FROM CH@@ UR@@ CH , spent the rest of the morning in the hotel .
the interview , though the deput@@ ation had been summoned on his initiative , was an affair that presented many difficulties and even dangers , and K@@ aren@@ in was very glad that it chan@@ ced to be in Moscow when he was there .
the members of the deput@@ ation had not the least comprehension of their role or of their duties .
K@@ aren@@ in had a prolonged t@@ us@@ s@@ le with them , and wrote out for them a programme which they were not to over@@ step , and having dismissed them he wrote two letters to Petersburg .
one of them contained instructions regarding this deput@@ ation .
in this matter his chief hel@@ per was the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna , who was a specialist in deput@@ ations .
he was just closing his letter to the lawyer when he heard O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's voice .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky was disput@@ ing with K@@ aren@@ in 's servant , and insisting that he should be announced .
'@@ no matter ! ' thought K@@ aren@@ in , ' it is even better so . I will tell him about my position with regard to his sister at once , and will explain why I C@@ AN@@ NOT dine at his house . '
'@@ As@@ k the gentleman in ! ' he said in a loud voice , collecting his papers and placing them inside a blo@@ t@@ ter .
'@@ i can '@@ t come , ' K@@ aren@@ in , who was standing , said col@@ dly , without offering his visitor a seat .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky opened his clear and shining eyes wide .
'@@ Why can '@@ t you ?
what do you mean ? ' he demanded in French , quite taken ab@@ ack .
'@@ i must tell you that I can '@@ t come because the family connection hitherto subsist@@ ing between us must now be sever@@ ed . '
I mean , how ?
why ? ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , smiling .
'@@ Because I am about to take proceedings to divorce your sister , my wife .
but before K@@ aren@@ in could finish what he was about to say , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky did something quite unexpected .
'@@ Dear me , Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich ! what are you talking about ? ' he cried , a look of pain appearing on his face .
'@@ It is true . '
'@@ For@@ give me , but I can '@@ t - I can '@@ t believe it ... '
'@@ Yes , I am under the painful necessity of applying for a divorce , ' he continued .
'@@ i will tell you just one thing , Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich !
there must be some misunderstanding ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ ah , if it were only a misunderstanding ! ... '
'@@ W@@ ait a moment - I understand , ' O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky interrupted him . ' but of course ... Only this : one should not be in a hurry . no ! one shoul@@ d@@ n '@@ t , shoul@@ d@@ n '@@ t be in a hurry . '
'@@ i was not in a hurry , ' replied K@@ aren@@ in , col@@ dly . ' in a case like this it was impossible to consult anyone .
well , before doing so , see my wife and talk it over with her !
she cares for Anna as for a sister , she is fond of you , and she is a wonderful woman .
K@@ aren@@ in considered , and for a while O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky gaz@@ ed at him , full of sympathy , without breaking the silence .
'@@ You will come and see her ? '
the reason I did not call on you is that I think our relationship must be altered . '
I don '@@ t see it .
but do , now do come and see my wife ! '
'@@ ah , we look at the matter differently , ' said K@@ aren@@ in , col@@ dly . ' however , don '@@ t let us talk about it . '
'@@ But why won '@@ t you come ?
sup@@ posing you came to dinner to @@@ -@@ @ day ?
my wife expects you .
she is a wonderful woman .
'@@ Well , and have you seen him ? ' said K@@ aren@@ in with a ven@@ om@@ ous smile .
'@@ Oh yes , he came to the Council yesterday .
he seems to know his business perfectly and is very active . '
'@@ Yes , but in what direction ? ' asked K@@ aren@@ in . ' toward getting things done , or toward changing what has been done already ?
we had lunch , and I showed him how to make that stuff - you know - wine with or@@ anges .
it is very refreshing , and it is amazing that he did not know of it .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky looked at his watch .
'@@ Dear me , it is getting on for five and I have still to call on Dol@@ gov@@ ush@@ in ! ...
you have no idea how griev@@ ed I and my wife will be if you don '@@ t . '
'@@ Beli@@ eve me , I appreciate it and hope that you will not repent it , ' O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky replied , smiling .
as he put on his over@@ coat while walking away , his arm struck the servant 's head . he laughed and went out .
'@@ Five o 'clock , and morning dress , if you please ! ' he sang out , returning to the door .
it W@@ AS P@@ AST FI@@ VE , and some of the visitors had already arrived , when the master of the house came home .
he entered together with Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev and P@@ est@@ sov , who had met on the door@@ step .
those two were the chief representatives of the Moscow intellectuals , as O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky called them .
both were men respected for their characters and abilities .
and as there is nothing less am@@ enable to agreement than disagreement on semi @@@ -@@ @ abstract themes , they not only dis@@ agreed in their opinions but had long been accustomed without anger to ri@@ dic@@ ule each other 's in@@ cor@@ ri@@ gible delu@@ sions .
they were entering when O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky over@@ took them , and were talking about the weather .
Prince Alexander Dmit@@ rich Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky , and young Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky , T@@ uro@@ v@@ t@@ sy@@ n , Kit@@ ty , and K@@ aren@@ in were already in the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky noticed at once that , without him , things were going badly in the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room .
they all sat like ' a parish priest 's wife visiting ' ( as the old Prince Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky expressed it ) , evidently puzzled as to why they were all assembled there , and forcing out words in order not to remain silent .
to have a drink at the Ch@@ ate@@ au des Fle@@ urs would be more in my line . '
Kit@@ ty kept looking toward the door , gathering courage not to bl@@ ush when Constan@@ tine Levin should enter .
young Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky , who had not been introduced to K@@ aren@@ in , tried to look as if this did not make him feel at all awkward .
he was the chief cause of the ic@@ iness which had frozen all the visitors till O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's arrival .
having pat@@ ted T@@ uro@@ v@@ t@@ sy@@ n on the shoulder , he whispered something funny in his ear and got him to sit down next to Dol@@ ly and the old Prince .
then he told Kit@@ ty that she was looking very nice , and introduced young Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky to K@@ aren@@ in .
in a moment he had kne@@ aded all that Society d@@ ough in such a way that the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room was in first @@@ -@@ @ rate form , and was filled with animated voices .
only Constan@@ tine Levin had not arrived .
but he met Levin at the door .
'@@ as if you ever could help being late ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky taking his hand .
'@@ are there many people here ?
whom have you got ? ' asked Levin with a bl@@ ush , knocking the snow off his cap with his g@@ love .
come , I will introduce you to K@@ aren@@ in . '
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , in spite of being Liberal , knew that to be acquainted with K@@ aren@@ in could not but be an honour , and therefore treated his best friends to that honour .
but at that moment Constan@@ tine Levin was not in a state fully to appreciate the pleasure of such an acquaintance .
he had not seen Kit@@ ty since the memorable evening when he had met V@@ ron@@ sky , excep@@ ting for that one moment when he had caught sight of her on the high road .
in the depths of his soul he had felt sure that he should meet her that evening , but to maintain his freedom of thought he had tried to assure himself that he did not know it .
now , when he heard that she was here , he was suddenly filled with such joy and at the same time with such fear , that it took away his breath and he could not utter what he wished to say .
the same as before , or as she was that morning in the carriage ?
'@@ Oh , do introduce me to K@@ aren@@ in ! ' he brought out with difficulty , and with des@@ pairing determination he entered the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room and saw her .
she was not as she had been before nor as he had seen her in the carriage . she was quite different .
she was frightened , shy , shame@@ faced , and therefore even more charming .
she saw him as soon as he entered . she had been waiting for him .
he came up , bowed , and silently held out his hand .
had it not been for the light qui@@ vering of her lips and the moisture that made her eyes brighter , her smile would have appeared almost calm when she said :
'@@ What a long time it is since we saw one another ! ' while with a desperate resolve her cold hand pressed his .
'@@ You have not seen me but I saw you , ' said Levin with a be@@ aming smile of joy . ' I saw you on your way to Er@@ g@@ ush@@ evo from the station . '
'@@ You were driving to Er@@ g@@ ush@@ evo , ' said Levin , feeling that the happiness with which his heart was over@@ flowing was taking his breath away .
'@@ How did I dare to connect anything that was not innocent with this pathetic being !
yes , what Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na told me seems to be true , ' he thought .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky took his arm and led him up to K@@ aren@@ in .
'@@ Let me introduce you , ' and he gave their names .
'@@ Very pleased to meet you again , ' said K@@ aren@@ in col@@ dly , as he shook hands with Levin .
'@@ are you acquainted ? ' asked O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky with surprise .
'@@ We spent three hours together in a railway carriage , ' said Levin with a smile , ' but we parted filled with curiosity , as people do after a mas@@ quer@@ ade , at any rate I did . '
if you please , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , mo@@ tioning them toward the dining @@@ -@@ @ room .
they stood round the s@@ cent@@ ed vodka and the delic@@ acies , and the conversation about the Russi@@ fication of Poland between Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , K@@ aren@@ in , and P@@ est@@ sov gradually sl@@ ack@@ ened in the expectation of dinner .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , who knew better than anyone how at the end of a most abstract and serious dispute unexpectedly to administer a grain of At@@ tic salt and thereby to change his interloc@@ utor 's frame of mind , did so now .
K@@ aren@@ in was arguing that the Russi@@ fication of Poland could only be accomplished by high principles which the Russian Administration must introduce .
P@@ est@@ sov insisted that one nation can assimil@@ ate another only when the former is more densely populated .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev agreed with both , but with limitations .
when they had left the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , to finish the conversation , remarked with a smile .
everybody laughed , and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky most mer@@ r@@ ily of all .
'@@ Yes , that is the very best way , ' he said , chew@@ ing some cheese and filling the glass with a special kind of vodka . and the conversation was really ended by the joke .
Levin smiled .
'@@ N@@ one at all .
on the contrary a child can kill a bear , ' he said , making room , with a slight bow , for the ladies who were coming up to the side @@@ -@@ @ table with the host@@ ess .
there was , it would seem , nothing unusual in what she had said , but for him what a meaning there was , in@@ expres@@ sible in words , in every sound and every movement of her lips , her eyes , and her hands as she said it !
there was a prayer for forgiveness , and trust in him , and a ca@@ ress - a tender , tim@@ id ca@@ ress , and a promise , and hope , and love for him in which he could not but believe and which suff@@ oc@@ ated him with joy .
'@@ no , we went to the Tver Province .
and g@@ aily and amus@@ ingly he told how after not sleeping all night he , in his sheep @@@ -@@ @ skin coat , had rushed into K@@ aren@@ in 's compartment .
'@@ the rights of passengers to a choice of seats are very ill @@@ -@@ @ defined , ' said K@@ aren@@ in , wi@@ ping the tips of his fingers on his hand@@ ker@@ chief .
'@@ i noticed that you were not quite sure what to make of me , ' said Levin with a good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured smile , ' so I ha@@ st@@ ened to start an intellectual conversation , to ex@@ pi@@ ate my sheep @@@ -@@ @ skin . '
he did not know that Levin felt as if he had grown a pair of wings .
Levin knew that she was listening to his words and liked hearing him , and that was the only thing he cared about .
not only in that room but in the whole world there existed for him nothing but Kit@@ ty and himself , and he had now acquired a great significance and importance .
he felt himself at a height that made him gi@@ d@@ dy , and there , somewhere far below , were all these good excellent K@@ aren@@ ins , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sk@@ ys , and the rest of the world .
quite cas@@ ually , without looking at them and just as if there was no other place to put them , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky placed Levin and Kit@@ ty side by side .
'@@ Well , you might sit here , ' he said to Levin .
the dinner was as good as the dinner service , a thing of which O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky was a con@@ nois@@ se@@ ur .
the soup , Marie Louise , had succeeded to perfection , the tiny pas@@ ties melted in one 's mouth and were flaw@@ less .
two foot@@ men and Matthew , wearing white ties , manipulated the food and the wines uno@@ st@@ ent@@ ati@@ ously , quietly , and quickly .
the dinner was a success on the material side , and no less so on the non @@@ -@@ @ material side .
the conversation , sometimes general and sometimes t@@ ê@@ te @@@ -@@ @ à @@@ -@@ @ t@@ ê@@ te , never ceased , and toward the end became so animated that the men left the table without c@@ easing to talk , and even K@@ aren@@ in was infected .
P@@ est@@ sov L@@ IK@@ ED TO BR@@ ING H@@ IS discussions TO A FIN@@ IS@@ H , and had not been satisfied with Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev 's remark , especially as he felt the fall@@ acy of his own opinion .
'@@ i did not mean , ' he began over his soup , addressing K@@ aren@@ in , ' the density of population alone , but that combined with firm foundations . it is not principles that count . '
'@@ It seems to me , ' replied K@@ aren@@ in deliberately and langu@@ idly , ' that it is one and the same thing .
in my opinion only that nation which is more highly developed can influence another , only that ... '
'@@ But the question is , ' interrupted P@@ est@@ sov in his deep voice - he was always in a hurry to speak and always seemed to stake his whole soul on what he was talking about - ' what does " higher development " consist of ?
the English , the French , or the Germans , which of them is more highly developed ?
which will nation@@ alize the other ?
we see that the Rhine has become F@@ ren@@ chi@@ fied , yet the Germans do not stand on a lower level ! ' he shouted . ' there is some other law ! '
'@@ i think that the influence will always be on the side of the truly educated , ' said K@@ aren@@ in slightly raising his eyebrows .
'@@ But what should we consider to be the signs of " true education " ? ' said P@@ est@@ sov .
'@@ i fancy that those signs are well known , ' replied K@@ aren@@ in .
'@@ You are a classic , Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich !
have a glass of cl@@ aret ? ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ Natural science has just as great an educational and mind @@@ -@@ @ developing influence , ' P@@ est@@ sov joined in . ' take astronomy , take bot@@ any , or zo@@ ology with its system of general laws ! '
'@@ i can '@@ t quite agree with you , ' answered K@@ aren@@ in . ' it seems to me that we must admit that the process of studying the forms of a language has in itself a beneficial effect on spiritual development .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev was going to say something but P@@ est@@ sov 's deep bass interrupted him .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev quietly waited to put in his word , evidently ready with triumph@@ ant ret@@ ort .
'@@ Ex@@ ac@@ tly . '
but now we know that those classical education @@@ -@@ @ pills contain the sal@@ ut@@ ary virtue of anti @@@ -@@ @ nihil@@ ism and we offer them boldly to our patients ...
but sup@@ posing it has not that sal@@ ut@@ ary virtue after all ? ' he concluded , adding the grain of At@@ tic salt .
everybody laughed at Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev 's ' pills , ' and T@@ uro@@ v@@ t@@ sy@@ n , who had at last heard the something funny for which he had been waiting as he listened to the conversation , laughed particularly loudly and mer@@ r@@ ily .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky had made no mistake in inviting P@@ est@@ sov .
with P@@ est@@ sov there , intellectual conversation could not stop for a moment .
hardly had Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev with his joke put an end to the discussion of one question before P@@ est@@ sov immediately raised another .
'@@ One C@@ AN@@ NOT even admit that the Government had that aim in view , ' he said .
'@@ the Government is evidently guided by general considerations and is indifferent to the influence its measures may have .
for instance , it ought to consider the education of women inj@@ ur@@ ious , yet it established courses of lectures and universities for women . '
and the conversation at once ve@@ ered to a new subject - the education of women .
K@@ aren@@ in expressed the view that the higher education of women is generally conf@@ ounded with the question of women 's emancip@@ ation , and that was the only reason for considering it inj@@ ur@@ ious .
'@@ i , on the contrary , think that these two questions are firmly bound together , ' said P@@ est@@ sov . ' it is a vicious circle .
we must not forget that the subj@@ ection of women is so widespread and so old that we often refuse to recognize the abyss that separates them from us . '
'@@ Un@@ doub@@ tedly . '
'@@ But if women , in some rare exceptional cases , can fill these posts , it seems to me that you should not speak of " rights . "
everybody will agree that when we fill the office of jur@@ y@@ man , town coun@@ cill@@ or , or tele@@ graph cler@@ k , we feel that we are fulfilling a duty .
so it would be more correct to say that women are seeking for duties , and quite rightly .
'@@ You are quite right , ' said K@@ aren@@ in . ' I think the only question is whether they are capable of fulfilling these duties . '
'@@ in all probability they will be extremely capable , ' inter@@ jected O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , ' when education is more widely diff@@ used among them .
we see this ... '
'@@ They thought the same of the neg@@ ro@@ es before their emancip@@ ation , ' said P@@ est@@ sov an@@ gr@@ ily .
'@@ the thing that seems strange to me is that women should look for new duties , ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , ' while , as we see , men unfortunately generally avoid theirs . '
'@@ Du@@ ties are connected with rights , power , money , hon@@ ours : that is what women are seeking , ' said P@@ est@@ sov .
'@@ It is just as if I were to strive for the right of being a wet nurse , and were offended because they pay women for it and won '@@ t pay me , ' said the old Prince .
T@@ uro@@ v@@ t@@ sy@@ n burst into loud laughter , and Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev felt sorry he had not made that remark himself .
even K@@ aren@@ in smiled .
'@@ Yes , but a man can '@@ t be a wet nurse , ' said P@@ est@@ sov , ' while a woman ... '
'@@ Oh yes , an Englis@@ hman on board ship did once nurse his baby , ' said the old Prince , allowing himself this ind@@ el@@ icacy in his daughters ' presence .
'@@ There will be about as many women officials as there are of such Englis@@ h@@ men , ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev .
'@@ But we are defending a principle , an ideal ! ' said P@@ est@@ sov in his son@@ orous bass . ' women wish to have the right to be independent and educated .
it even struck him as strange that they should care to talk about things that could make no difference to anyone .
in the same way what was being said about the rights of the education of women should have interested Kit@@ ty .
but now it did not interest her at all .
they began by Levin 's telling Kit@@ ty in answer to her question of how he could have seen her in the carriage in the summer , how he was going back from the ha@@ y fields along the high road and met her .
'@@ It was early in the morning .
I expect you had only just woke up .
your mother was asleep in her corner .
it was a lovely morning .
something important ? '
'@@ Was I not very unti@@ dy ? ' she thought , but seeing the rap@@ tur@@ ous smile which the recoll@@ ection of these details ev@@ oked she felt that the impression she had produced was a very pleasing one .
'@@ i really don '@@ t remember . ' ' how pleas@@ antly T@@ uro@@ v@@ t@@ sy@@ n laughs ! ' said Levin , looking with pleasure at his mo@@ ist eyes and shaking body .
'@@ i see you think he is a bad man . '
'@@ Not bad , but a mere ci@@ ph@@ er . '
change your opinion quickly , ' said Kit@@ ty . ' I too did not think much of him , but he is ... he is a dear fellow and wonder@@ fully kind @@@ -@@ @ hearted .
'@@ How did you manage to find out his heart ? ' ' he and I are great friends .
I know him very well .
and fancy ! ' she went on in a whis@@ per , ' he was so sorry for her that he stopped and helped her to nurse the children .
really , he stayed three weeks in the house and looked after the children like a nurse . '
'@@ i am telling Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich about T@@ uro@@ v@@ t@@ sy@@ n and the scar@@ let fever , ' she said , leaning over toward her sister .
'@@ Yes ? it was wonderful ! he is splendid ! ' said Dol@@ ly , looking toward T@@ uro@@ v@@ t@@ sy@@ n who felt that he was being talked about , and giving him a gentle smile .
Levin looked at T@@ uro@@ v@@ t@@ sy@@ n again and wondered how it was he had failed to realize what a charming man he was .
'@@ i am sorry , very sorry . I shall never again think ill of anyone ! ' he said mer@@ r@@ ily ; expressing what he sincerely felt at the moment .
P@@ est@@ sov more than once during dinner @@@ -@@ @ time flew at these questions , but Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky carefully diverted him from them .
when they rose from table and the ladies had left the room , P@@ est@@ sov did not follow them but turned to K@@ aren@@ in and began to state the chief cause of inequality .
the inequality between husband and wife , in his opinion , lay in the fact that the in@@ fidelity of a wife and that of a husband were un@@ equally punished both by law and by public opinion .
'@@ no , I don '@@ t smoke , ' quietly replied K@@ aren@@ in , and , as if wishing to show that he was not afraid of the conversation , he turned with a cold smile to P@@ est@@ sov .
as one always seems to knock a sore place , so that day O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky felt that unfortunately the conversation kept striking K@@ aren@@ in 's sore place .
'@@ Oh ! ' said K@@ aren@@ in in@@ differently , and raising his eyebrows he went to the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room .
'@@ i am so glad you came , ' said Dol@@ ly with a frightened smile , as she met him in the sitting @@@ -@@ @ room through which he had to pass : ' I must speak with you .
K@@ aren@@ in , with the same look of indifference , produced by his raised eyebrows , sat down beside her and fe@@ igned a smile .
'@@ Yes , ' he said , ' especially as I wished to ask you to excuse me for having to go away at once .
Dol@@ ly was firmly convinced of Anna 's innocence , and felt herself growing pale and her lips trembling from anger with this cold , un@@ feeling man who so calmly intended to ruin her innocent friend .
'@@ Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich , ' she said , looking into his eyes with desperate determination . ' I asked you about Anna and you did not give me an answer .
'@@ i think she is well , Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na , ' replied K@@ aren@@ in without looking at her .
'@@ Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich , forgive me , I have no right to ... but I love Anna like a sister , and respect her and I beg , I impl@@ ore you to tell me what has happened between you , what do you accuse her of ? '
Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich w@@ inc@@ ed , and almost closing his eyes bowed his head .
'@@ i don '@@ t , I don '@@ t believe it , I C@@ AN@@ NOT believe it ! ' Dol@@ ly said , cl@@ as@@ ping her b@@ ony hands with an energetic movement .
she rose quickly , put her hand on K@@ aren@@ in 's sleeve and said , ' We shall be disturbed here , come this way , please . '
he rose and obedi@@ ently followed her into the school@@ room .
they sat down at the table covered with leather cloth all cut about with pen@@ kni@@ ves .
'@@ i don '@@ t believe it , I don '@@ t ! ' she uttered , trying to catch his eyes , which avoided hers .
'@@ One can '@@ t dis@@ believe facts , Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na , ' said he , emphasizing the word fact .
'@@ no , no , it can '@@ t be !
no , for God 's sake ! ... you are mistaken , ' said Dol@@ ly , raising her hands to her temples and closing her eyes .
K@@ aren@@ in smiled col@@ dly with his lips only , wishing to prove to her and to himself the firm@@ ness of his conviction ; but this passionate defence , though it did not shake him , lac@@ erated his wound .
he began speaking with more animation .
'@@ It is difficult to make a mistake when a wife herself announces to her husband that eight years of married life and a son have all been an error , and that she wants to begin life from the beginning again , ' he said cros@@ sly , sni@@ ffing .
'@@ Anna and - vice ... I C@@ AN@@ NOT combine them , I C@@ AN@@ NOT believe it ! '
'@@ Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na , ' he said , now looking straight at Dol@@ ly 's kind , excited face and feeling his tongue involun@@ tarily loos@@ ened . ' I would give much for the possibility of doub@@ ting .
while I was in doubt it was hard , but not so hard as it is now .
while I doubted , I had hope ; but now there is no hope left and all the same I doubt everything .
I doubt everything so much that I hate my son , and sometimes believe he is not my son .
there was no need for him to say this .
Dol@@ ly had understood it as soon as he looked her in the face . she felt sorry for him , and her faith in her friend 's innocence was shaken .
'@@ Oh , it is terrible , terrible !
but can it be true that you have decided on a divorce ? '
'@@ i have decided to take the final step .
'@@ No@@ thing to do , nothing to do ! ' she mut@@ tered with tears in her eyes . ' no , there is something else to do , ' she said .
'@@ i understand , I understand very well , ' said Dol@@ ly and her head dropped .
she was silent , thinking of herself and her own sorrow , and then suddenly and energe@@ tically she raised her head and folded her hands as in prayer . ' but wait !
think of her !
what will become of her if you throw her off ? '
'@@ i have thought , Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na , and have thought deeply , ' said K@@ aren@@ in .
his face fl@@ ushed in blo@@ t@@ ches and his dim eyes looked straight at her .
Dol@@ ly now p@@ iti@@ ed him with all her heart . ' I did that very thing when she herself informed me of my shame ; I let everything go on as before .
'@@ Any@@ thing but divorce ! ' answered Dol@@ ly .
'@@ no , this is too awful .
'@@ What can I do ? ' said K@@ aren@@ in , sh@@ ru@@ gging his shoulders and raising his eyebrows .
the recoll@@ ection of his wife 's last del@@ inqu@@ ency irrit@@ ated him so much that he again became as cold as he had been at the beginning of the conversation . ' I am very grateful for your sympathy , but it is time for me to go , ' he said rising .
'@@ no , wait a bit !
you should not ruin her .
wait a bit . I will tell you about myself .
I married , and my husband deceived me ; in my anger and jealousy I wished to abandon everything , I myself wished ...
but I was brought to my senses , and by whom ?
Anna saved me .
and here I am living ; my children growing , my husband returns to the family and feels his error , grows pu@@ rer and better , and I live ...
I have forgiven , and you must forgive . '
'@@ i C@@ AN@@ NOT forgive ; I don '@@ t wish to and don '@@ t think it would be right .
I have done everything for that woman and she has tram@@ pled everything in the mud which is natural to her .
'@@ Love those that hate you ... ' whispered Dol@@ ly shame@@ fac@@ edly .
K@@ aren@@ in smiled cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ously .
he had long known all that , but it could not apply to his case .
'@@ Love them that hate you , but you can '@@ t love them whom you hate .
forgive me for having upset you .
when EV@@ ER@@ Y@@ BO@@ D@@ Y W@@ AS leaving THE T@@ ABLE Levin wanted to follow Kit@@ ty into the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room but was afraid she would not like it because it would make his atten@@ tions to her too obvious .
so he stopped with the group of men , taking part in their conversation . but without looking through the open door at Kit@@ ty he was conscious of her movements , her looks , and the place in the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room where she sat .
he began at once , and without the slightest effort , to fulfil the promise he had made her , of thinking well of and always liking everybody .
the conversation had turned to the question of village communes , in which P@@ est@@ sov saw some special principle which he called the ' chorus principle . '
Levin did not agree either with P@@ est@@ sov or with his brother Sergi@@ us , who , in a way of his own , both admitted and did not admit the importance of the Russian Commun@@ al System .
but he talked to them only with the idea of getting them to agree and sof@@ tening their controversy .
he was not at all interested in what he himself said , still less in what they were saying , and only desired one thing - that everybody should feel cont@@ ented and pleased .
he now knew the one thing that was important .
and that one thing was at first there in the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room , but afterwards began moving and paused in the doorway .
without looking round he felt a pair of eyes and a smile directed toward him , and he could not help turning .
'@@ i thought you were going to the piano , ' he said , moving toward her . ' that is what I miss in the country - music . '
'@@ no , we were only coming to call you away . thank you for coming , ' she said , rewarding him with a smile as with a gift .
'@@ What is the use of arguing ?
no one ever conv@@ in@@ ces another . '
'@@ Yes , you are quite right , ' said Levin , ' for the most part , people argue so warmly only because they C@@ AN@@ NOT make out what it is that their opponent wants to prove . '
this was what he wanted to express .
she wrink@@ led her forehead , trying to understand .
but as soon as he began to explain she understood .
'@@ i see : one must find out what one 's opponent is cont@@ ending for , what he likes , and then one can ... '
Levin smiled joy@@ fully : he was so struck by the change from the confused wor@@ dy dispute with his brother and P@@ est@@ sov to this lac@@ onic , clear , and almost wor@@ dless communication of a very complex idea .
Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky left them , and Kit@@ ty went up to a table prepared for cards , sat down , took a piece of chal@@ k , and began drawing con@@ centric circles on the new green cloth of the table .
they went back to the conversation at dinner about women 's rights and occupations .
Levin agreed with Dol@@ ly , that a girl who does not get married can find woman 's work in the family .
he supported this view by saying that no family can dispen@@ se with a help , and that in every family , rich or poor , there are and must be nurses , either paid or belonging to the family .
'@@ no , ' said Kit@@ ty , bl@@ ushing , but looking all the more boldly at him with her truthful eyes : ' a girl may be so placed that she C@@ AN@@ NOT enter into a family without humiliation , while she herself ... '
submitting to her mood , he felt in his whole being an ever @@@ -@@ @ increasing stress of joy .
'@@ Oh , I have scri@@ b@@ bled over the whole table ! ' she said , and putting down the chal@@ k moved as if to get up .
'@@ How can I remain here alone , without her ? ' he thought horror @@@ -@@ @ struck , and took up the chal@@ k . ' Don '@@ t go , ' he said and sat down at the table . ' I have long wished to ask you something ! '
he looked straight into her kind though frightened eyes .
'@@ Please do . '
'@@ There , ' he said , and wrote the following letters , - W , y , a : I , c , n , b ; d , y , m , t , o , n ?
these letters stood for : when you answered : it can not be ; did you mean then or never ?
it was quite unlikely that she would be able to make out this complicated sentence ; but he looked at her with an expression as if his life depended on her understanding what those letters meant .
she glanced seriously at him and then , leaning her fro@@ w@@ ning forehead on her hand , began reading .
occasionally she looked up at him , her look asking him : ' is it what I think ? '
'@@ What word is this ? ' he asked pointing to the ' n ' which stood for never .
suddenly his face be@@ amed - he had understood .
the letters meant ' Then I could not answer otherwise . '
he looked at her question@@ ingly , and tim@@ idly .
'@@ Only then ? '
'@@ Yes , ' answered her smile .
and now ? ' he said .
I will tell you what I wish , what I very much wish ! ' and she wrote these initial letters : T , y , m , f , a , f , w , h .
this meant , ' that you might forgive and forget what happened . '
he seized the chal@@ k with nervous , trembling fingers , broke it , and wrote the initial letters of the following : ' I have nothing to forget or forgive , I never ceased to love you . '
he sat down and wrote out a long sentence .
for a long time he could not make out what she meant and he often looked up in her eyes .
he could not find the words she meant at all ; but in her beautiful eyes , radiant with joy , he saw all that he wanted to know .
and he wrote down three letters .
but before he had finished writing she read it under his hand , finished the sentence herself , and wrote the answer : ' yes . '
'@@ Pl@@ aying " secretary " ? ' said the old Prince approaching them . ' come now , we must be going , if you mean to come to the theatre . '
Levin rose and accompanied Kit@@ ty to the door .
everything had been said in that conversation . she had said that she loved him , and would tell her father and mother , and he had said that he would call in the morning .
in order not to be alone and to deceive time , he needed to be with and to talk to somebody .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky would have been the pleas@@ ant@@ est companion for him now , but he was going to an evening party as he said ( really to the ballet ) .
Levin only had time to tell him he was happy and fond of him and would never , never forget what he had done for him .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's look and smile showed Levin that he understood him rightly .
'@@ Then it 's not time to die yet ? ' asked O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky with feeling , pressing Levin 's hand .
Dol@@ ly too , when saying good @@@ -@@ @ bye to him , spoke as if congrat@@ ulating him , saying : ' I am so glad you and Kit@@ ty have met again .
she did not understand how high and un@@ attainable for her all this was , and she should not have dared to refer to it .
Levin took leave of them but , not to remain alone , he fast@@ ened on to his brother .
'@@ Where are you going ? '
'@@ Well , I 'll come with you .
'@@ Why not ? let us go , ' answered Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , smiling . ' what has happened to you to @@@ -@@ @ day ? '
'@@ To me ?
happiness is with me , ' said Levin , letting down the window of the carriage in which they were driving . ' you don '@@ t mind ?
it is so stu@@ ffy here .
'@@ i am very glad , she seems a fine gi ... ' he began .
'@@ She is a fine girl ' were words so ordinary , so insignificant , so inappropriate to his feelings .
'@@ You may say that to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row , to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row , but nothing more !
will they really let me in to the meeting ? '
'@@ What are you speaking on to @@@ -@@ @ night ? ' asked Levin not c@@ easing to smile .
that was plain from the confused and embarrassed manner in which he read the report .
then followed the discussion .
and then S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky ( he too was there ) also said something very fin@@ ely and no@@ bly .
they were doing no one any harm , and everybody was pleased .
that was quite evident from the way they spoke to him , and the ten@@ derness and affection with which they all , even strangers , looked at him
'@@ Well , are you cont@@ ented ? ' asked Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev .
'@@ Qu@@ ite .
I never thought it would be so interesting .
S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky came up and asked Levin to come home with him and have some tea .
Levin could not at all think or remember why he had ever felt dissatisfied with S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky or what he had thought lacking in him .
he was an intelligent and remarkably kind fellow .
S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky questioned him about his affairs in the country , as usual dis@@ believing in the possibility of dev@@ ising anything that had not already been discovered in Western Europe ; but now Levin did not consider this at all unpleasant .
on the contrary he felt that S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky was right , and that the whole business was insignificant , and he noticed the wonderful gentl@@ eness and del@@ icacy with which S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky avoided saying that he was right .
the ladies were especially nice ; it seemed to Levin that they already knew all about it and sympath@@ ized with him but did not mention it out of del@@ icacy .
S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky , y@@ aw@@ ning , showed him to the hall and wondered at the strange state his friend was in .
it was past one .
Levin returned to the hotel and the thought of how with his impati@@ ence he would spend the remaining ten hours frightened him .
the attendant on duty lighted his candle and was going away , but Levin stopped him .
E@@ gor , the attendant , of whom Levin had taken no notice her@@ et@@ o@@ fore , turned out to be a very intelligent , good , and above all very kind man .
'@@ i say , E@@ gor , don '@@ t you find it difficult to keep awake ? '
'@@ What 's one to do ?
it turned out that E@@ gor had a family , three boys and a girl who was a seam@@ stress and whom he wanted to marry to an assistant in a harness business .
Levin took this opportunity to express to E@@ gor his opinion that in marriage the chief thing is - love , and that when there is love there will always be happiness because happiness lies always within oneself .
'a wonder@@ fully kind man ! ' thought Levin .
'@@ And you , E@@ gor , when you married , did you love your wife ? '
'@@ How can one help it ? ' answered E@@ gor .
and Levin saw that E@@ gor too was in an ex@@ ul@@ tant state and wished to tell him all his most intimate feelings .
'@@ My life too was very curious .
from a child I ... ' he began with shining eyes , evidently infected by Levin 's ex@@ ul@@ tation as men get infected by others ' y@@ aw@@ ning .
but at that moment a bell rang , E@@ gor went away and Levin remained alone .
he had scarcely eaten anything at dinner and had refused both tea and sup@@ per at S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky 's , but could not think of eating .
he had not slept the night before but could not think of sleep either .
the room was cool , but he felt suff@@ oc@@ ated with heat .
he looked now at the cross , now at the star , and inhal@@ ed the fresh fro@@ sty air which flowed with a regular current into the room , following , as in a dream , the images and memories that arose in his fancy .
towards four o 'clock he heard steps in the corridor and looked out .
he passed de@@ jec@@ tedly , fro@@ w@@ ning and c@@ ough@@ ing .
'@@ Poor , unfortunate fellow ! ' thought Levin , and tears of affection and pity for the man filled his eyes .
he shut the little window , washed , dressed , and went out into the street .
the streets W@@ ERE ST@@ ILL E@@ MP@@ TY .
the front door was locked , everybody was still sleeping .
he went back to his room in the hotel and ordered coffee .
the day @@@ -@@ @ wa@@ iter , not E@@ gor this time , brought it to him .
Levin wished to have a talk with him , but the bell rang and the wa@@ iter went away .
Levin tried to drink a little coffee , and put a piece of roll into his mouth , but his mouth could do nothing with it .
it was past nine when he reached the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys ' por@@ ch a second time .
it would be necessary to live through another two hours at least .
all that night and morning Levin had lived quite unconsciously , and felt quite outside the conditions of material existence .
he was sure that he could fly upwards or knock down the corner of a house , were it necessary .
he spent the rest of the time walking about the streets , looking at his watch , and gaz@@ ing around .
two children going to school , some pig@@ eons that flew down from the roof , and a few lo@@ aves put outside a b@@ aker 's window by an invisible hand touched him particularly .
all these things were so unusually beautiful that Levin laughed and cried with joy .
after a long round , through the Gaz@@ et@@ ny Street and the Kis@@ lov@@ ka , he returned to the hotel , put his watch in front of him , and sat down waiting till it should be twelve .
in the next room they were saying something about machines and fraud , and c@@ ough@@ ing as people do of a morning .
Levin went out into the por@@ ch .
with joyful faces they surrounded Levin , disput@@ ing among themselves , and offering him their services .
trying not to offend the others , and promising to let them too drive him later on he hired one and told him to drive to the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys ' .
the iz@@ v@@ osh@@ chik was charming with the white band of his shirt showing from under his coat and cl@@ inging closely to his full , red , stur@@ dy neck .
the iz@@ v@@ osh@@ chik knew the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys ' house , and r@@ ounding his el@@ b@@ ows in a manner specially respectful to his fare called ' Who@@ a ! ' and stopped at the por@@ ch .
the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys ' hall @@@ -@@ @ porter certainly knew everything .
that was evident from the smile in his eyes and the tone in which he said :
'@@ It 's long since you were here last , Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich ! '
not only did he know everything , but he evidently rejo@@ iced and made efforts to hide his joy .
gl@@ ancing into his kind old eyes , Levin felt something new even in his happiness .
won '@@ t you leave it here ? ' he said when Levin turned back for his cap .
that meant something .
'@@ Who@@ m shall I announce you to ? ' asked the foot@@ man .
the foot@@ man was young , of the new @@@ -@@ @ fashioned kind , and a d@@ andy , but a very kind and good fellow , and he too understood it all .
the young lady ... ' said Levin .
the first person he met was M@@ l@@ le Lin@@ on .
she was passing through the dancing @@@ -@@ @ hall and her cur@@ ls and her face shone .
he had scarcely begun to speak to her when he heard the ru@@ st@@ le of a dress outside the door , his eyes no longer saw M@@ l@@ le Lin@@ on , and the joyful terror of the near@@ ness of his happiness seized him .
M@@ l@@ le Lin@@ on hur@@ ri@@ edly left him and went toward the other door .
she did not walk but was borne toward him by some invisible force .
he saw nothing but her clear , true eyes , frightened by the same joy of love which filled his own heart .
those eyes be@@ amed nearer and nearer to him , dazz@@ ling him with their glow of love .
she stopped so close that she touched him .
her arms rose and her hands dropped on his shoulders .
she had done everything she could - she had run up to him and given herself entirely , sh@@ y@@ ly , and joy@@ fully .
he put his arms round her and pressed his lips to her mouth that was waiting for his kiss .
she too had not slept all night and had waited for him the whole morning .
her mother and father had definitely given their consent and were happy in her happiness .
she had prepared herself to meet him alone , and had rejo@@ iced at the idea , yet had felt tim@@ id and bas@@ h@@ ful and had not known what she would do .
she had heard his step and his voice and had waited behind the door for M@@ l@@ le Lin@@ on to go .
'@@ Come to M@@ ama ! ' she said , taking him by the hand .
he took her hand and kis@@ sed it .
'@@ Can it be true ' he said at last in a smo@@ ther@@ ed voice . ' dear , I C@@ AN@@ NOT believe that you love me . '
'@@ Then it 's all finished !
love her .
'@@ Pap@@ a ! ' exclaimed Kit@@ ty and closed his mouth with her hands .
'@@ Well , well , I won '@@ t ! ' he said . ' I am very , very ... ple@@ a ...
the Princess SA@@ T IN H@@ ER arm@@ chair silently smiling , and the Prince seated himself beside her .
Kit@@ ty stood close to her father 's chair , still holding his hand .
the Princess was the first to break the silence and bring all their thoughts and feelings back to the practical side of life , and for the first moments this seemed strange and even painful to them all .
'@@ Here he is , ' said the old Prince , pointing to Levin . ' he is the principal person concerned . '
if you ask me - the bet@@ ro@@ thal to @@@ -@@ @ day and the wedding to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row ! '
'@@ Well then , next week . '
'@@ Why not ? '
'@@ What an idea ! ' said the mother with a pleased smile at his ha@@ ste . ' and the trous@@ se@@ au ? '
as if a trous@@ se@@ au and a bet@@ ro@@ thal ceremony and all that could spoil my happiness ! nothing can spoil it ! '
'@@ Well , you see , I don '@@ t know at all ; I only expressed my wish , ' he said , to excuse himself .
the Princess went up to her husband , kis@@ sed him and was about to go away , but he stopped her , embraced her , and ten@@ derly , like a young lover , kis@@ sed her several times , with a smile .
the old couple seemed to have become confused for the moment , and not to know whether it was they who were again in love or only their daughter .
when they had gone Levin came up to his bet@@ ro@@ thed and took her hand .
he had now mastered himself and was able to speak , and there was much he had to say to her ; but what he said was not at all what he had intended .
'@@ How well I knew it would happen !
I never dared hope , yet in my soul I was always certain , ' said he . ' I believe it was pre@@ destined . '
I must ask you : can you forget it ? '
'@@ Per@@ haps it was all for the best .
you have much to forgive me .
I must tell you ... '
he referred to one of the things he had decided to tell her .
'@@ no , not now , later ! ' he said .
I am afraid of nothing .
'@@ It is settled that you will have me , whatever I may be ... You will not reject me ...
their conversation was interrupted by M@@ l@@ le Lin@@ on , who with a fe@@ igned yet aff@@ ection@@ ate smile came to congratulate her favourite pupil .
afterwards relatives arrived , and that be@@ ati@@ fic tum@@ ult began which did not cease until the day after the wedding .
all that time Levin felt uncomfortable and bored , but the stress of his joy went on increasing .
all that time he felt that many things he did not know were expected of him , but he did all he was told , and it all gave him joy .
'@@ Now we shall eat some sweets , ' said M@@ l@@ le Lin@@ on , and off went Levin to buy sweets .
'@@ i am very pleased indeed , ' said S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky , ' I advise you to go to F@@ om@@ in 's for the flowers . ' -
'@@ are they necessary ? ' and off he went to
'@@ are presents required ? ' and off he rushed to Ful@@ da , the jew@@ eller 's .
the confession he had promised her was the one painful episode of that time .
he consulted the old Prince , and with his permission gave Kit@@ ty his diary , which contained the facts that were tor@@ m@@ enting him .
he had written the diary with the intention of showing it to his future bride @@@ -@@ @ elect .
she was religious and had never doubted the truth of her religion , but the lack of external religion in him did not affect her at all .
she knew , through her love , his whole soul , and saw in it what she desired , and the fact that that spiritual condition is called ag@@ no@@ s@@ ticism was quite indifferent to her .
the other confession made her we@@ ep bit@@ terly .
Levin had not handed her the diary without an inward struggle .
'@@ Take , take those dreadful books back ! ' she cried , pushing away the note @@@ -@@ @ books that lay on the table before her . ' why did you give me them ? ...
but no - it was best after all , ' she added , pit@@ ying the despair on his face . ' but it is dreadful , dreadful ! '
his head dro@@ op@@ ed and he remained silent , unable to speak .
'@@ You will not forgive me ? ' he whispered .
'@@ Yes , I have forgiven you , but it is dreadful ! '
however , his happiness was so great that this confession did not im@@ pair it , but only gave it a new ting@@ e .
she for@@ gave him , but after that he felt yet more un@@ worthy of her , morally bowed still lower before her , and valued still more highly his un@@ deserved happiness .
involun@@ tarily reviewing THE impressions left on his mind by the conversations at dinner and after , K@@ aren@@ in returned to his solitary room .
what Dol@@ ly had said about forgiveness had merely v@@ exed him .
whether or not to apply the Christian principle to his own case was too difficult a question to be lightly discussed , and K@@ aren@@ in had long since answered it in the negative .
evidently everybody had agreed with that , though they were too polite to say so .
K@@ aren@@ in ordered tea , sat down at a table , took up a time @@@ -@@ @ table , and began planning his journey .
'@@ Two tele@@ grams , ' said the val@@ et , entering . ' excuse me , your Excell@@ ency - I had only just gone out . '
K@@ aren@@ in took the tele@@ grams and opened them .
the first contained the news that St@@ remo@@ v had obtained the very appointment K@@ aren@@ in had been hoping for .
he threw down the tel@@ eg@@ ram and fl@@ ushed . rising , he began to pace the room .
'@@ Qu@@ os v@@ ult per@@ d@@ ere dem@@ ent@@ at , ' he thought , qu@@ os being those who had had a hand in making the appointment .
how was it they did not see that by giving him that post they were ru@@ ining themselves and their own prestige ?
'@@ Some@@ thing else of the same kind , ' he thought bit@@ terly , as he opened the second tel@@ eg@@ ram .
it was from his wife , and Anna , written in blue pencil , was the first word he saw . ' I am dying .
I beg and entre@@ at you , come !
I shall die easier for your forgiveness , ' he read .
smiling cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ously , he threw down the tel@@ eg@@ ram .
'@@ She would not hesitate at any deception .
she was going to be confined ; perhaps that is the illness .
but what can they be aiming at ?
to legitim@@ ize the child , compromise me , and prevent a divorce ? ' he reflected . ' but there is something about dying ... '
he re @@@ -@@ @ read the tel@@ eg@@ ram , and was suddenly struck by the direct meaning of the words .
'@@ Sup@@ posing it is true ? ' he said to himself . ' if it is true , and at the moment of suffering and approach to death she is sincerely repent@@ ant , and I , believing it to be false , refuse to come ?
it would not only be cruel and everybody would condemn me , but it would be stupid on my part . '
'@@ Peter , keep the carriage !
I am returning to Petersburg , ' he told the val@@ et .
he decided to go back to Petersburg and see his wife .
while on his way he did not again think about what he should do .
he dared not think of it , because when he imagined what would happen he could not drive from his mind the thought that her death would at once dissolve all the difficulties of the situation .
a carriage , with a co@@ ach@@ man asleep on the box , and an iz@@ v@@ osh@@ chik were standing at the entrance .
as he entered the hall K@@ aren@@ in dragged forth his resolve as it were from a remote corner of his brain , and con@@ ned it over . it said :
'@@ How is your mistress ? '
'@@ Saf@@ ely delivered yesterday . '
K@@ aren@@ in halted and turned pale .
now he clearly realized how much he had desired her death .
Kor@@ ney , wearing his morning ap@@ ron , came running down@@ stairs .
'@@ Very bad , ' he said . ' there was a consultation yesterday and the doctor is here now . '
'@@ Take my things , ' said K@@ aren@@ in ; and somewhat relieved by the news that there was still some hope of her dying , he entered the ante @@@ -@@ @ room .
on the hall @@@ -@@ @ stand was hanging a military coat , and he noticed it .
'@@ Who is here ? '
'@@ the doctor , the mid@@ wife , and Count V@@ ron@@ sky . '
K@@ aren@@ in passed on to the inner apartments .
there was no one in the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room , but the mid@@ wife , with l@@ il@@ ac rib@@ bons in her cap , came out of Anna 's bou@@ do@@ ir .
she approached K@@ aren@@ in , and with a familiarity bred by death 's approach took him by the hand and led him toward the bedroom .
'@@ Than@@ k God you have come !
she talks only about you and nothing but you , ' said she .
'@@ Be quick and bring the ice ! ' came the authoritative sound of the doctor 's voice from the bedroom .
K@@ aren@@ in entered the bou@@ do@@ ir .
beside the table , sitting with his side toward the back of a low chair , was V@@ ron@@ sky , his hands covering his face , we@@ eping .
I am entirely in your hands ... but allow me to remain here , please ! ... However , I am in your hands .
Anna 's voice , talking about something , came from the bedroom .
it sounded cheerful and animated , and its articul@@ ation was extremely distinct .
K@@ aren@@ in entered and went up to the bed .
she appeared not only fresh and well but in the best of spirits .
she spoke rapidly , in a ringing voice with extraordinarily accurate int@@ on@@ ations , full of feeling .
'@@ Because Alex@@ is ... I am speaking of Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich - how strange and terrible that they are both called Alex@@ is , is it not ? - Alex@@ is would not have refused me .
I should have forgotten and he would have forgiven ...
Oh God ! what wear@@ iness !
give me some water , quick !
Oh , but it will be bad for her , for my little girl !
well , I agree , it will be better so .
he will come back and it will pain him to see her .
'@@ Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna , he has come !
here he is , ' said the mid@@ wife , trying to draw Anna 's attention to Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich .
one must know his eyes . Ser@@ ez@@ ha 's are just the same - that 's why I can '@@ t bear to see them .
have they given Ser@@ ez@@ ha his dinner ?
suddenly she rec@@ o@@ iled , became silent and frightened , and put her arms before her face as if in expectation of a blow ; she had seen her husband .
'@@ no , no ! ' she began again . ' I am not afraid of him .
I am in a hurry , because I have no time . I have not long to live , I shall soon become f@@ ever@@ ish and then I shall no longer understand anything .
now I understand , understand everything and see everything ! '
and every time he did so he saw her eyes looking at him with such tender and ec@@ static emotion as he had never before seen in them .
'@@ W@@ ait a bit - you don '@@ t know ...
wait , wait ! ... ' she paused as if to collect her thoughts . ' yes , ' she continued , ' yes , yes , yes !
this is what I wished to say .
Don '@@ t be surprised at me ; I am still the same ...
but there is another in me as well , and I am afraid of her . she fell in love with that other one , and I wished to hate you but could not forget her who was before .
here they are , my hands and feet and fingers , whole hundre@@ d@@ weights are on them .
my fingers , see how enormous they are !
but all this will soon end ...
I only want one thing : forgive me , forgive me completely !
I am dread@@ fully bad , but the nurse told about the holy marty@@ r - what was her name ? - she was worse .
and I shall go to Rome , there is a wilderness there and then I shall be in nobody 's way . I shall only take Ser@@ ez@@ ha and the little girl ...
you are too good ! ' with one hot hand she held his , while with the other she pushed him away .
he was not thinking that the law of Christ , which all his life he had tried to fulfil , told him to forgive and love his enemies but a joy@@ ous feeling of forgiveness and love for his enemies , filled his soul .
he kn@@ elt with his head resting on her lent arm , which burnt through its sleeve like fire , and so@@ b@@ bed like a child .
she put her arm round his bal@@ d head , moved closer to him , and looked up with an expression of proud defiance .
they have come again , why don '@@ t they go away ? ...
Oh , take these fur@@ s off me ! '
the doctor moved her arms and carefully drew the bed@@ clothes over her shoulders .
she me@@ ek@@ ly lay down on her back and gaz@@ ed with radiant eyes straight before her .
'@@ Rem@@ ember that the only thing I want is your forgiveness , I wish for nothing else ...
why does he not come in ? ' she cried , calling to V@@ ron@@ sky on the other side of the door . ' come , come !
V@@ ron@@ sky came to her bed@@ side and , on seeing Anna , again hid his face in his hands .
'@@ Un@@ cover your face ! look at him !
he is a saint , ' said she . ' un@@ cover , yes , un@@ cover your face ! ' she went on an@@ gr@@ ily .
K@@ aren@@ in took V@@ ron@@ sky 's hands and moved them away from his face , terrible with its look of suffering and shame .
K@@ aren@@ in held out his hand , without restr@@ aining the tears that were falling .
'@@ Than@@ k God , thank God ! ' she cried . ' now everything is ready .
how badly those flowers are drawn , not a bit like viol@@ ets , ' and she pointed to the wallpaper .
Oh , my God , my God ! '
and she began to tos@@ s in her bed .
the doctor and his colleagues said it was pu@@ er@@ per@@ al fever , which in ninety @@@ -@@ @ nine cases out of a hundred ended fat@@ ally .
all day she was f@@ ever@@ ish , deli@@ ri@@ ous , and unconscious .
at midnight she lay in@@ sensible , with hardly any pulse .
V@@ ron@@ sky went away , but came again in the morning to inqu@@ ire . K@@ aren@@ in met him in the ante @@@ -@@ @ room and said : ' remain here : she may ask for you , ' and himself showed him into Anna 's bou@@ do@@ ir .
toward morning she had become excited and animated , and her thoughts and words flowed rapidly ; but again this state lap@@ sed into un@@ consciousness .
on the third day she was just the same and the doctors gave some hope .
that day K@@ aren@@ in went out into the bou@@ do@@ ir where V@@ ron@@ sky sat , and having locked the door took a seat opposite him .
'@@ Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , feeling that an explanation was coming . ' I am unable to think , unable to understand .
he was about to rise , but K@@ aren@@ in took him by the hand and said :
'@@ i beg you to hear me ; it is necessary .
I must explain to you my feelings , those that have guided me and will guide me in future , so that you may not mis@@ understand me .
you know that I resolved on a divorce and had even taken steps toward obtaining it .
I will not conceal from you that when I took action I was in a state of ind@@ eci@@ sion ; I suffered , and I confess that I was haun@@ ted by a desire for vengeance .
on receiving the tel@@ eg@@ ram I came here with the same feelings - more than that , I wished for her death . but ... '
he stopped and reflected whether he should reveal his feelings or not . ' but I saw her and for@@ gave her .
and the joy of for@@ giving has revealed my duty to me .
he rose , and so@@ bs broke his voice .
V@@ ron@@ sky got up at once , and sto@@ oping before him looked up into his face without un@@ bending his back .
he could not understand K@@ aren@@ in , but felt that here was something high , and inaccessible to one with his outlook on life .
after H@@ IS conversation with K@@ aren@@ in V@@ ron@@ sky went out on to the K@@ aren@@ ins ' por@@ ch and then stopped , recalling with difficulty where he was and where he ought to go .
he felt ashamed , humiliated , guilty , and deprived of the possibility of cleansing himself from his degradation .
he felt himself knocked quite out of the ru@@ t along which he had hitherto tro@@ dden so proudly and so lightly .
all the apparently solid habits and rules of his life suddenly seemed false and in@@ applicable .
V@@ ron@@ sky could not help being conscious of this .
they had suddenly exchanged roles .
V@@ ron@@ sky felt K@@ aren@@ in 's greatness and his own humiliation , . K@@ aren@@ in 's ri@@ ghtness and his own wrong@@ doing .
he felt that the husband in his sorrow was mag@@ n@@ anim@@ ous , while he himself was mean and trivial in his dec@@ ep@@ tions .
but the consciousness of his degradation toward the man whom he had un@@ justly desp@@ ised accounted for but a small portion of his grief .
during her illness he had learnt to know her thoroughly , had seen into her very soul ; and it seemed to him that he had never loved her before .
and just now , when he knew her and loved her in the right way , he had been humiliated before her and had lost her for ever , leaving her nothing but a shameful memory of himself .
but most terrible of all was the ridiculous , shameful figure he had cut when K@@ aren@@ in was pulling his hands from before his shame @@@ -@@ @ suff@@ used face .
returning home after the three sle@@ e@@ pless nights , V@@ ron@@ sky did not und@@ ress but lay down prone on a sofa , with his head on his folded arms .
his head was heavy .
'@@ To sleep , to forget ! ' he said to himself with the calm certainty of a healthy man that being tired and in want of sleep he would at once fall asleep .
and in fact in a moment his thoughts grew confused and he began to fall into the abyss of for@@ get@@ fulness .
his eyes were wide open as if he had not slept at all .
'@@ S@@ leep , sleep , ' he kept repeating to himself .
but with his eyes closed he could see yet more distinctly Anna 's face , as he had seen it on that memorable evening before the race .
'@@ all that is ended and never will be again , and she wishes to eff@@ ace it from her memory .
I can '@@ t live without it .
then how can we be reconciled - how can we be reconciled ? ' said he aloud , and went on unconsciously repeating those words .
this re@@ it@@ eration prevented other images and memories which were thr@@ ong@@ ing his brain from arising .
again , following each other with great rap@@ idity , his hap@@ pi@@ est moments rose in his fancy ; and with them his recent humiliation .
'@@ Take away his hands , ' Anna 's voice is saying .
he still lay trying to fall asleep , though he had lost all hope of succeeding , and kept repeating in a whis@@ per random words connected with dis@@ join@@ ted thoughts , in order to prevent other images from rising .
he listened and heard repeated in a strange mad whis@@ per the words , ' Un@@ able to value , unable to enjoy ; unable to value , unable to enjoy . '
'@@ What is this ? am I going mad ? ' he asked himself .
fing@@ ering a Tas@@ sel of the cushion , he tried to think of Var@@ ya as he had last seen her .
but to think of anything ex@@ tran@@ eous was painful .
he moved the cushion and pressed his head against it , but his eyes would not remain closed without effort .
he jumped up and sat down .
his thoughts gli@@ ded quickly over his life un@@ connected with his passion for Anna .
'@@ Am@@ bition ?
Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy ?
society ?
the Court ? ' he could not dwell on any of these things .
'@@ That 's how one goes mad , ' he said again , ' and how one shoots oneself so as not to be ashamed , ' he concluded slowly .
going up to a door he closed it , then with fixed gaze and tightly cl@@ en@@ ched teeth , approached the table , took up his revol@@ ver , examined it , turned it to a loaded chamber , and pon@@ dered .
for a minute or two he stood mo@@ tionless with bowed head , a strained expression of effort on his face , holding the revol@@ ver in his hand .
'@@ of course ! ' he said to himself , as if led to a definite conclusion by a logical , continued , and clear line of reasoning .
in reality that convinced ' Of course ! ' was merely the outcome of the repetition of a round of fan@@ cies and recoll@@ ections similar to those he had already gone over dozens of times in the last hour .
they were the same memories of happiness lost for ever , the same thoughts of the sen@@ sel@@ essness of all that life had in store for him , and the same consciousness of his humiliation .
and they followed in the same rotation .
he did not hear the sound of a shot , but a powerful blow on the chest knocked him off his feet .
he wished to steady himself by the table , dropped the revol@@ ver , re@@ eled , and sat down on the floor , looking about him in aston@@ ishment .
he made an effort and understood that he was on the floor , and , seeing blood on the tiger @@@ -@@ @ skin and on his hand , realized that he had tried to shoot himself .
'@@ Stu@@ pid ! ...
missed , ' he mut@@ tered , feeling with his hand for the revol@@ ver .
it was close to him but he sought it further away .
continuing his search he leaned over to the other side , and unable to keep his balance , fell down bleeding .
the elegant servant with the whis@@ kers , who often complained to his friends about the weakness of his nerves , was so upset when he saw his master lying on the floor , that he left him to ble@@ ed to death and ran away to get help .
he for@@ gave V@@ ron@@ sky and p@@ iti@@ ed him , especially when reports of V@@ ron@@ sky 's desperate action reached him .
he p@@ iti@@ ed his son too , more than he had done before , and repro@@ ached himself for not having paid more attention to him .
but for the new @@@ -@@ @ born little girl he had a peculiar sentiment , not of pity alone but even of ten@@ derness .
several times a day he went to the nur@@ sery , and remained there so long that the nurses , who had been shy in his presence , became quite used to him .
at such moments especially K@@ aren@@ in felt quite calm and at peace with himself , seeing nothing exceptional in his position and nothing that ought to be altered .
but as time went on he saw more and more clearly that , however natural his position might appear to him at the time , he would not be allowed to remain in it .
he felt that everybody looked at him with questioning surprise without understanding him , expecting something from him ; and especially he was aware of the insecurity and artif@@ ici@@ ality of his relation to his wife .
when the sof@@ tened mood caused by the near@@ ness of death had passed , K@@ aren@@ in began to notice that Anna feared him , was oppressed by his presence , and avoided looking him straight in the eyes .
it was as if she wished , yet could not make up her mind , to say something , and forese@@ eing that their present relation could not continue , expected something from him too .
at the end of February Anna 's newborn daughter , also named Anna , happened to fall ill .
K@@ aren@@ in had been in the nur@@ sery that morning , and having given orders to send for the doctor , had gone to the Department .
toward four o 'clock , having finished his work , he returned home .
on entering the ante @@@ -@@ @ room he saw there a handsome foot@@ man in gold @@@ -@@ @ bra@@ ided li@@ very with a bear@@ skin cape , holding a cloak lined with white fur .
'@@ Who is here ? ' asked K@@ aren@@ in .
'@@ Princess Elis@@ abeth Feder@@ ovna T@@ ver@@ skaya , ' answered the foot@@ man with a smile , - as it seemed to K@@ aren@@ in .
all through that difficult time K@@ aren@@ in noticed that all his worldly acquaintances , especially the women , displayed a particularly lively interest in him and his wife .
he noticed in all these acquaintances a kind of joy , which they suppressed with difficulty , like the joy he had noticed in the lawyer 's eyes and again just now in the foot@@ man 's .
everybody seemed el@@ ated , as if they were giving some one in marriage .
when they met him they inqui@@ red with scarcely hidden pleasure about Anna 's health .
the presence of Princess T@@ ver@@ skaya and the memories associated with her , coupled with the fact that he had never liked her , was unpleasant to K@@ aren@@ in , and he went straight to the nur@@ sery .
in the front nur@@ sery Ser@@ ez@@ ha , lying with his chest on the table and his legs on a chair , was drawing something and ch@@ attering mer@@ r@@ ily .
an English nur@@ sery govern@@ ess , who since Anna 's illness had replaced the French govern@@ ess with the boy , sat doing some cro@@ ch@@ et @@@ -@@ @ work . she hur@@ ri@@ edly rose , cur@@ t@@ se@@ yed , and n@@ ud@@ ged Ser@@ ez@@ ha .
K@@ aren@@ in passed his hand over his son 's hair , answered the govern@@ ess 's inquiry about Anna 's health , and asked what the doctor had said about baby .
'@@ the doctor says there is no danger and has ordered baths , sir . '
'@@ But she is still suffering , ' remarked K@@ aren@@ in , listening to the crying child in the next room .
'@@ i think the nurse is un@@ suitable , sir , ' said the Englis@@ h@@ woman with decision ..
'@@ Why do you think so ? ' he asked , stopping short .
'@@ the same thing happened in Countess Paul 's case .
K@@ aren@@ in reflected a moment and then entered the other room .
'@@ still no better ? ' asked K@@ aren@@ in .
'@@ Very rest@@ less , ' said the head @@@ -@@ @ nurse in a whis@@ per .
'@@ Miss Ed@@ wards says that perhaps the nurse has no milk , ' he said .
'@@ i think so too , Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich . '
'@@ Then why did you not say so ? '
the nurse was an old family servant , and in her simple words K@@ aren@@ in thought he noticed a hint at his position .
the baby scre@@ amed louder , catching her breath and growing ho@@ arse .
'@@ the doctor must be asked to examine the nurse , ' said K@@ aren@@ in .
in that smile also K@@ aren@@ in thought he saw himself and his position ridicul@@ ed .
'@@ Un@@ fortunate child ! ' said the nurse , h@@ ushing the baby and continuing to walk up and down with it .
K@@ aren@@ in sat down on a chair and with a look full of suffering and wear@@ iness watched the nurse as she paced the room .
when the child was paci@@ fied and laid in her deep cot , and the nurse after smoo@@ thing the little pillow went away , K@@ aren@@ in rose , and stepping with difficulty on ti@@ pto@@ e approached the infant .
stepping on the soft carpet , as he approached the door he involun@@ tarily over@@ heard a conversation which he had no wish to hear .
'@@ If he had not been going away I should understand your refusal and his too .
but your husband must be above that , ' Bet@@ sy was saying .
Don '@@ t talk about it , ' answered Anna in an excited voice .
'@@ Yes , but you can '@@ t but wish to say good @@@ -@@ @ bye to a man who tried to shoot himself for your sake ... '
'@@ It 's just for that reason that I don '@@ t wish it . '
K@@ aren@@ in , with a frightened and guilty face , stopped short and thought of returning unnoticed ; but coming to the conclusion that this would be un@@ dignified he turned , c@@ ough@@ ed , and went toward the bedroom door .
Anna , in a grey dressing @@@ -@@ @ g@@ own , with her black hair cro@@ pped short but already growing again like a thick brush over her round head , sat on a couch .
a usual when she saw her husband all her animation vanished from her face ; she bowed her head and glanced un@@ easily at Bet@@ sy .
'@@ ah ! ' she exclaimed , as if in surprise , ' I am so glad you are at home .
I have not seen you since Anna 's illness .
I have heard everything ... all about your attenti@@ veness .
yes , you are a wonderful husband ! ' she said with a significant and aff@@ able expression , as if she were confer@@ ring on him an Order of High@@ min@@ de@@ dness for his conduct toward his wife .
K@@ aren@@ in bowed col@@ dly , and kis@@ sing his wife 's hand asked about her health .
'@@ i think I am better , ' she said , avoiding his eyes .
'@@ But your face looks f@@ ever@@ ish , ' said he , emphasizing the word f@@ ever@@ ish .
'@@ We have been talking too much , ' said Bet@@ sy . ' I know it was selfish of me and I am going . '
'@@ no , please stay !
K@@ aren@@ in cracked his fingers and bowed his head .
'@@ You said , my love , that it would depend on Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich . ' Bet@@ sy corrected her .
'@@ Oh no ! I can '@@ t receive him , and it would lead ... ' She stopped suddenly and glanced inqu@@ ir@@ ingly at her husband , who was not looking at her . ' in a word , I don '@@ t wish ... '
K@@ aren@@ in drew nearer and was going to take her hand .
her first impulse was to draw away her hand from his mo@@ ist one with the thick swelling veins , that was seeking hers ; but with evident effort she pressed it .
'@@ Well , good @@@ -@@ @ bye , my precious ! ' said Bet@@ sy , rising again .
she kis@@ sed Anna and went out .
K@@ aren@@ in followed her .
'@@ Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich !
Alex@@ is V@@ ron@@ sky is honour person@@ i@@ fied , and besides he is leaving for Tashk@@ end . '
'@@ Than@@ ks for your sympathy and advice , Princess !
but the question whom my wife will and whom she will not receive she will decide for herself . '
[ in Russian as in French and other languages the second person singular is used in conversation between intim@@ ates and also in speaking to inferi@@ ors . ]
however ... '
no need whatever ! '
'@@ Let us say no more about it , ' she added more calmly .
'@@ i left it to you to decide the matter , and am very glad to see ... ' began K@@ aren@@ in .
'@@ That my wish coinci@@ des with yours , ' she rapidly completed his sentence , ex@@ as@@ per@@ ated by the slow@@ ness with which he spoke , and knowing beforehand what he would say .
he ass@@ ented . ' yes , and Princess T@@ ver@@ skaya 's intrusion into this most difficult family matter is entirely out of place ...
especially as she ... '
'@@ i don '@@ t believe anything they say about her , ' Anna put in quickly . ' I know that she is sincerely fond of me . '
K@@ aren@@ in sigh@@ ed and paused .
she was ag@@ it@@ at@@ edly to@@ ying with the t@@ as@@ sels of her dressing @@@ -@@ @ g@@ own , gl@@ ancing at him with that tor@@ m@@ enting feeling of physical re@@ pulsion for which she blamed herself , but which she could not overcome .
the one thing she was longing for was to get rid of his ob@@ no@@ x@@ ious presence .
'@@ i have just sent for the doctor , ' said he .
'@@ Yes , but the little one keeps screaming , and they say the nurse has not enough milk . '
'@@ i don '@@ t blame ... '
'@@ Yes , you are blaming me ! Oh God , why did I not die ? ' and she began to so@@ b . ' forgive me , I am upset ! I am unjust , ' she went on , controlling herself . ' but go ... '
'@@ no , it can '@@ t go on like that , ' he told himself with conviction after leaving his wife .
he saw clearly that the world and also his wife were demanding something from him , but exactly what this something was he did not comprehend .
all this was ar@@ ousing a feeling of anim@@ osity in his soul , spo@@ iling his peace of mind and depriving his achievement of all value .
bad as this would be , it would be preferable to a complete rupture , which would place her in a hopeless and shameful position , and deprive him of all he loved .
but he felt powerless ; he was aware in advance that everybody would be against him and that he would not be allowed to do what now seemed so natural and good , that he would be obliged to do what was wrong but what seemed to them necessary .
before Bet@@ sy H@@ AD P@@ AS@@ SE@@ D O@@ UT of the dining @@@ -@@ @ room O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , who had just come from Elis@@ e@@ yev 's , where newly @@@ -@@ @ arrived oy@@ sters were to be had , met her in the doorway .
'@@ ah , Princess ! what a pleasure to meet you , ' he began . ' and I have been at your house . '
'@@ We meet only for a moment , as I am just going , ' said Bet@@ sy , smiling and putting on her g@@ love .
there is nothing for which I am more thankful than for the revival of the old custom of hand @@@ -@@ @ kis@@ sing , ' and he kis@@ sed Bet@@ sy 's hand : ' when shall I see you again ? '
'@@ You are not worth it , ' said Bet@@ sy , smiling .
'@@ Yes , I am well worth it , because I have become the most serious of men .
I not only settle my own , but other people 's family affairs , ' said he with a significant glance .
'@@ He will kill her , ' said Bet@@ sy in a significant whis@@ per . ' this is impossible , impossible ... '
'@@ i am very glad you think so , ' returned O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , shaking his head with an expression of grave , wo@@ e@@ beg@@ one commis@@ eration . ' that is why I have come to Petersburg . '
'@@ the whole town is talking of it , ' she said . ' it is an impossible situation .
he does not understand that she is one of those women who C@@ AN@@ NOT play with their feelings .
one of two things must happen : either he must take her away , acting energe@@ tically - or he must divorce her .
'@@ Yes , yes ... exactly ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , sigh@@ ing . ' I have come because of that - I mean , not entirely because of it ...
I have been made Cham@@ ber@@ lain , and had to tender my thanks .
'@@ Well then , may God help you , ' said Bet@@ sy .
he found her in tears .
'@@ Very , very badly .
'@@ i think you give way to mel@@ anch@@ ol@@ y .
I know it is hard , but ... '
'@@ i have heard it said that women love men for their very faults , ' Anna began suddenly , ' but I hate him for his virtues .
I C@@ AN@@ NOT live with him .
try and realize it : even his looks have a physical effect on me and drive me beside myself .
what am I to do ?
I was unhappy and thought it impossible to be more so ; but I could never have imagined such a terrible position as I am now in . will you believe it ?
knowing that he is a kind and generous man - that I am not worth his little finger - nevertheless I hate him !
I hate him for his generosity .
and there is nothing left for me but ... '
she was going to say ' death , ' but he did not let her finish .
'@@ You are ill and excited , ' said he . ' believe me , you are greatly exagg@@ erating the case .
his soft comfor@@ ting words and smiles had as soo@@ thing and cal@@ ming an effect as al@@ mond oil , and Anna soon felt this .
and even worse than lost .
I. am not lost yet ; I C@@ AN@@ NOT say " all is finished " : on the contrary , I feel that all is not yet finished .
I am like a tightly @@@ -@@ @ str@@ ung cord which must break .
there is no situation from which there is no escape . '
only one ... '
again he understood from her frightened face that she considered death to be the only escape , and did not let her finish .
'@@ Not at all ! ' he replied . ' listen .
again he smiled his al@@ mond @@@ -@@ @ oil smile . ' I will begin at the beginning : you married a man twenty years older than yourself .
you married without love and without having known love .
'a dreadful mistake ! ' said Anna .
'@@ But again I say that is an accomplished fact .
that is a mis@@ fortune , but that too is an accomplished fact .
your husband has accepted that and forgiven you . ' he paused between each sentence , expecting her to make objections ; but she made no answer .
'@@ That is so ? now comes the question : can you go on living with your husband ?
do you wish it ?
does he wish it ? '
'@@ But you yourself say you C@@ AN@@ NOT endure him ? '
'@@ Yes , but let me ... '
'@@ You can '@@ t understand .
I feel that I am flying head@@ long over some precip@@ ice but must not even try to save myself .
'@@ Never mind , we 'll spread out something to catch you .
I understand that you C@@ AN@@ NOT take it upon yourself to express your wishes and feelings . '
'@@ i have no wishes at all ... except that everything were at an end . '
do you think it weighs on him less than on you ?
you suffer and he suffers ; what can come of that ?
while a divorce would solve the whole problem , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky not without difficulty expressing his main idea , and looking at her significantly .
how happy I should be if I could arrange it , ' continued O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , now smiling more boldly . ' Don '@@ t , don '@@ t say a word !
if only God helps me to say what I feel !
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , WITH THE SA@@ ME R@@ AT@@ H@@ ER solemn EX@@ PRE@@ SS@@ ION with which he was won@@ t to take the chair at Council meetings , entered K@@ aren@@ in 's study .
K@@ aren@@ in , with his arms crossed behind him , was pac@@ ing up and down med@@ itating on the very subject that his wife and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky had been discussing .
'@@ i am not disturbing you ? ' asked O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , experiencing at the sight of his brother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law a feeling of embarrassment quite unusual with him .
do you want anything ? ' K@@ aren@@ in answered reluctantly .
'@@ Yes . I wished ... I must have ... I must have a talk with you , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , surprised at his own un@@ accustomed tim@@ idity .
that tim@@ idity was so unexpected and strange that O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky could not believe it was his conscience telling him that what he was about to do was wrong .
'@@ i hope you believe in my affection for my sister and my sincere attachment and respect for yourself , ' said he , bl@@ ushing .
K@@ aren@@ in stopped . he made no reply , but the expression of sub@@ missive self @@@ -@@ @ sacrifice on his face struck O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ i intended to talk to you about my sister and your mutual position , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , still struggling with his un@@ won@@ ted tim@@ idity .
K@@ aren@@ in smiled sadly , looked at his brother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , and without repl@@ ying went to the table and took from it an unfinished letter which he handed to him .
'@@ i think about that subject incess@@ antly , and this is what I have begun to write , as I think I can put it better in writing , and my presence is dist@@ a@@ ste@@ ful to her , ' he said , holding out the letter .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky took the letter , looked with perpl@@ exed amaz@@ ement at the dull eyes fixed on him , and began reading :
'@@ i see that my presence is dist@@ a@@ ste@@ ful to you .
hard as it was for me to assure myself of this , I see that it is so , and there is no help for it .
I do not blame you , and God is my witness that when I saw you ill , I resolved with my whole soul to forget everything that had come between us and to begin a new life .
I do not repent and never shall repent of what I did , as my only desire was for your welfare , the welfare of your soul ; but now I see that I have not succeeded .
tell me yourself what would give you real happiness and peace of mind !
I submit myself entirely to your wishes and sense of justice . '
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky returned the letter and went on looking at his brother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law with the same amaz@@ ement , not knowing what to say .
that silence was so dis@@ concer@@ ting to both that O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's lips t@@ wit@@ ched painfully as he silently and fix@@ edly gaz@@ ed at K@@ aren@@ in 's face .
'@@ That is what I wanted to tell her , ' said K@@ aren@@ in as he turned away .
'@@ i must know what she wants , ' said K@@ aren@@ in .
'@@ i am afraid she does not understand her position herself .
she is no judge of it , ' replied O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , growing more composed . ' she is crushed , literally crushed by your generosity .
if she reads this letter she will not have the strength to say anything - she will only hang her head lower than ever . '
how am I to find out what she wishes ? '
'@@ If you will permit me to express my opinion , I think it is for you to say what you think should be done in order to put an end to this state of affairs . '
'@@ There is a way out of every situation , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , rising and growing excited . ' there was a time when you wished to break with her ...
should you be now convinced that you C@@ AN@@ NOT make each other mutually happy ... '
'@@ Happ@@ iness can be defined so differently !
however , I am ready to agree to anything - I want nothing at all .
and this new relation can only be established when both are free . '
yes , divorce , ' O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky answered , red@@ dening .
what is to be done if they find out that life together has become impossible , as might happen anywhere ? '
K@@ aren@@ in sigh@@ ed heavily and closed his eyes . ' there is only one thing to consider : does either party wish to re@@ marry ?
for other and yet more important reasons also , divorce seemed out of the question .
to leave him with his mother was not possible ; the divorced mother would have another , an illegitimate family , in which the position and education of a step@@ son would in all probability be a bad one .
should he keep him himself ?
he knew that would be reven@@ ge@@ ful and he did not wish for revenge .
but besides all this , what made divorce seem to K@@ aren@@ in more impossible than any other course was that by con@@ sent@@ ing to it he would by that very act ruin Anna .
and having connected these words with his forgiveness and with his attachment to the children , he now understood them in his own way .
hundreds of times he had thought it over and had come to the conclusion that a divorce was not merely less simple than his brother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law considered it , but quite out of the question .
'@@ the only question is , on what conditions you will agree to a divorce .
she does not want anything , does not ask for anything , but leaves all to your generosity . '
'@@ You are upset . I quite understand .
'@@ Yes , yes ! ' he cried in a shr@@ ill voice . ' I will take the dis@@ grace , and even give up my son ... but ... but had we not better let it alone ?
however , do as you like ! ' and turning away so that his brother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law should not see his face , he sat down on a chair by the window .
it was very bitter , and he felt ashamed ; yet mixed with the bitterness and the shame he felt a sense of joy and emotion at the greatness of his own humility .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky was touched .
K@@ aren@@ in would have answered , but could not for his tears .
'@@ It is a fatal disaster and has to be faced . I regard this disaster as an accomplished fact and am trying to help both you and her , ' O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky went on .
to his cont@@ ent@@ ment was added an idea that had just occurred to him . when the affair was all settled he would ask his wife and intimate friends a rid@@ dle : ' what is the difference between me and a chemist ? '
answer : ' a chemist makes solutions which do not make anyone happy , but I have made a dissolution and made three people happy ! '
or , ' Why am I like a chemist ? ...
however , I will improve on it later , ' he said to himself with a smile .
although V@@ ron@@ sky 'S wound had missed the heart it was dangerous , and for several days he lay between life and death .
when he was first able to talk again his brother 's wife Var@@ ya was alone with him .
'@@ Var@@ ya ! ' he said looking ster@@ nly at her , ' it went off accidentally !
never speak of it , please , and tell everybody else that .
without saying a word Var@@ ya bent over him and looked in his face with a joyful smile .
his eyes were clear and no longer f@@ ever@@ ish , but their expression was stern .
'@@ Well , thank God ! ' she exclaimed . ' you are not in pain ? '
'a little , here , ' and he pointed to his chest .
he looked at her silently , his broad j@@ aws set , while she band@@ aged him .
'@@ i am not deli@@ ri@@ ous ... Please arrange so that no one shall say that I shot myself on purpose . '
only I hope you will not go letting it off accidentally any more , ' said she with an inqu@@ iring smile .
'@@ i expect I Sh@@ an '@@ t , but it would have been better ... ' and he smiled glo@@ om@@ ily .
despite these words and that smile , which greatly per@@ tur@@ bed Var@@ ya , when the inflammation left him and he became con@@ val@@ escent he felt that he had rid himself entirely of one part of his grief .
by his action he seemed to have washed off the shame and degradation he had previously felt .
now he could think quietly about K@@ aren@@ in , fully realizing his generosity without being humiliated thereby .
besides that , he got into his old ru@@ t again .
he found he could look people in the face once more , and he was able to live in accord with his former habits .
the one thing he could not tear out of his heart , although he continually struggled against it , was a regret bordering on despair at having lost Anna for ever .
Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy thought out a post for him in Tashk@@ end and V@@ ron@@ sky accepted the proposition without the least hesitation .
but the nearer the hour for his departure approached the harder seemed the sacrifice he was making to what he considered his duty .
his wound was quite healed and he went about making preparations for his journey to Tashk@@ end .
'@@ Only to see her once more , and then to bury myself , to die ! ' he thought , as he was making a round of farewell calls , and he expressed this thought to Bet@@ sy .
it was with this message that Bet@@ sy went to Anna , and she brought him an answer in the negative .
'@@ So much the better , ' thought V@@ ron@@ sky when he heard it . ' it would have been a weakness - would have taken away all the strength I have left . '
next day Bet@@ sy herself came and announced that she had received , through O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , the definite news that K@@ aren@@ in con@@ s@@ ented to a divorce and that therefore V@@ ron@@ sky might see Anna .
without seeing anyone or anything he ran up the stairs and entered her room with hur@@ ried steps - almost at a run .
without thinking , or considering whether they were alone or not , he embraced her and covered her face , hands , and neck with kis@@ ses .
Anna had prepared herself for this meeting and had thought about what she would say to him ; but she had no time to say any of it , seized by his passion .
she wished to calm him and herself , but it was too late .
his passion communicated itself to her .
her lip trem@@ bled so that for a long time she could not speak .
'@@ Yes , you have taken possession of me and I am yours , ' she brought out at last , pressing his hands to her bos@@ om .
'@@ It had to be ! ' said he . ' as long as we live it will have to be .
'@@ It is true , ' she said , growing pal@@ er and pal@@ er , putting her arms about his head . ' still , there is something terrible in this , after what has been . '
'@@ It will pass , it will all pass , and we shall be so happy !
if our love could be stronger , there being something terrible in it would make it so , ' he said , raising his head with a smile that showed his fine teeth .
she could not help smiling in answer , not to his words but to his enam@@ oured eyes .
she took his hand and stro@@ ked with it her cold cheek and cro@@ pped hair .
'@@ i don '@@ t know you with this short hair !
'@@ Yes , I feel very weak , ' she said with a smile , and her lip trem@@ bled again .
'@@ We will go to Italy and you will soon get well , ' said he .
'@@ is it possible that we shall be like husband and wife , alone , a family , you and I ? ' she said , looking closely into his eyes .
'@@ i am only surprised that it could ever have been otherwise . '
'@@ Steve says he will agree to anything , but I C@@ AN@@ NOT accept his generosity , ' she said dream@@ ily , gaz@@ ing past V@@ ron@@ sky 's face . ' I don '@@ t want a divorce .
he was quite unable to understand how she could , at the moment of their first re@@ union , think about her son and divorce .
as if all that were not im@@ material !
'@@ Don '@@ t talk and don '@@ t think about it ' he said , playing with her hand and trying to draw her attention to himself ; but she continued to gaze past him .
'@@ Oh , why did I not die ? it would have been best ! ' she said , the tears streaming nois@@ el@@ essly down her cheeks ; but unwilling to pain him , she tried to smile .
to refuse the fl@@ attering offer of a post at Tashk@@ end , which was a dangerous one , would have seemed dis@@ graceful and impossible according to V@@ ron@@ sky 's former views .
but now without a moment 's hesitation he did refuse it and , observing that his superi@@ ors fro@@ w@@ ned upon his action , at once resigned his commission .
a month later K@@ aren@@ in and his son were left alone in the house , and Anna went abroad with V@@ ron@@ sky - not only without getting a divorce but having resolutely refused it .

consequently , having decided to divide her daughter 's trous@@ se@@ au into two parts , a lesser and a larger , the Princess eventually con@@ s@@ ented to have the wedding before Adv@@ ent .
this plan would be all the more convenient because the young couple intended immediately after the wedding to go to the country , where the larger part of the trous@@ se@@ au would not be required .
he had not even any plans or aims for the future , but left these to others to decide , quite sure that everything would turn out splen@@ di@@ dly .
his brother Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , and the Princess directed his actions .
his brother borrowed money for him , the Princess advised him to return to the country after the wedding , and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky suggested going abroad .
he agreed to everything .
'@@ Do whatever you like , whatever pleas@@ es you !
I am happy , and my happiness C@@ AN@@ NOT be made or mar@@ red by anything you do , ' he thought .
she knew that in the country Levin had work of which he was fond .
as he saw , she not only did not understand that work but did not wish to understand it .
'@@ i say , ' O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky asked Levin one day after his return from the country , where he had made all preparations for the young couple , ' have you got a certificate to show that you have received communion ? '
'@@ Oh dear ! ' exclaimed Levin . ' I think it is nine years since I went to communion !
'@@ You are a good one ! ' remarked O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , laughing . ' and you call me a nihil@@ ist !
but O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky arranged that too .
Levin began to prepare himself .
to him , as an ag@@ nostic who yet respected the religious beliefs of others , it was always very trying to be present at , or to take part in , any religious ceremony .
in his present state of mind , sof@@ tened and sensitive to everything , to be obliged to pretend was not only trying but appeared impossible .
now , in his state of triumph at the flow@@ ering time of his life , he was to be obliged to lie or bl@@ asph@@ eme !
but question O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky as he would , as to whether he could not obtain a certificate without going to communion , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky declared that he must go through with it .
and the priest is such a nice old man .
he will draw that tooth for you so that you will scarcely feel it . '
standing in church during the first service he attended , Levin tried to revive the memories of his youth and the strong religious feeling with which at the age of sixteen or seventeen he had been im@@ bu@@ ed .
but he immediately became convinced that it was out of his power to do so .
he then tried to regard it all as a meaningless , empty custom , like making a round of calls , but felt equally unable to do that .
in matters of religion Levin , like most of his contemporaries , had very indefinite views .
he could not believe in it , and yet was not firmly convinced that it was all false .
he stood through the mass and V@@ esp@@ ers and ev@@ ens@@ ong , and the next day , having got up earlier than usual , he went to church before breakfast to hear morning prayers and to confess .
no one else was in the church except a soldier @@@ -@@ @ beg@@ gar , two old women , and the clergy .
the young de@@ acon , the two hal@@ ves of his long back clearly distingu@@ ishable through his thin under @@@ -@@ @ cass@@ ock , met him , and going at once to a small table beside the wall , began reading the prayers .
'@@ How wonder@@ fully expressive her hand is ! ' he thought , recalling how they had sat at the corner table the day before .
he remembered how he had kis@@ sed the hand and afterwards examined the conver@@ ging lines on the rosy palm .
again ' L@@ ord@@ v@@ mer@@ cy@@ p@@ ons ! ' thought he , crossing himself , b@@ owing , and watching the movements of the b@@ owing de@@ acon 's flexible back .
'@@ Well , it will soon be over now , ' he thought .
a minute later he put his head out and bec@@ k@@ oned to Levin .
the sealed @@@ -@@ @ up thoughts began stirring in Levin 's head , but he ha@@ st@@ ened to drive them away .
'@@ It will get settled somehow , ' he thought , and went to the AM@@ B@@ O .
on going up the steps and turning to the right he saw the priest .
the latter , an old man with a thin gri@@ zz@@ led beard and kind , weary eyes , stood beside the lec@@ tern turning over the leaves of a Miss@@ al .
b@@ owing slightly to Levin he began at once in his stereo@@ typed tone to read the prayers .
at the end he bowed to the ground and turned to Levin .
'@@ i have doubted , and still doubt , everything , ' replied Levin in a voice unpleasant to himself , and stopped .
the priest paused a few seconds to see whether Levin would say anything more , and then closing his eyes said rapidly , with a strong provincial accent :
'@@ Dou@@ b@@ ts are natural to human weakness , but we must pray that our mer@@ ciful Lord will strengthen us .
what are your particular sins ? ' he continued without the slightest pause , as if anxious not to waste time .
'@@ My chief sin is doubt .
I doubt everything and am in doubt nearly all the time . '
'@@ Dou@@ b@@ t is natural to human weakness , ' repeated the priest . ' what do you doubt in particular ? '
sometimes I even doubt the existence of God , ' said Levin involun@@ tarily , and was horri@@ fied at the impro@@ pri@@ ety of his words .
'@@ What doubt can there be of the existence of God ? ' he asked with a faint smile .
'@@ What doubt can you have of the Creator when you see His creation ? ' continued the priest in his rapid , stereo@@ typed voice . ' who has ador@@ ned the vault of Heaven with lumin@@ aries ?
who has dec@@ ked the earth with beauty ?
how could it all be , without a Creator ? ' he asked , with an inqu@@ iring glance at Levin .
Levin felt that it would not be proper to enter into a philosop@@ hic discussion with a priest , and therefore merely replied to the direct questions ,
'@@ i don '@@ t know . '
'@@ Then how can you doubt that God created everything ? ' said the priest in puzzled amaz@@ ement .
'@@ i don '@@ t understand it at all , ' said Levin , bl@@ ushing , and feeling that his words were silly and that they could not but be silly .
'@@ Pr@@ ay to God and entre@@ at Him !
even the holy F@@ athers doubted and prayed God to strengthen their faith .
the devil is very powerful and we must resist him .
the priest paused a@@ while as if in thought .
'@@ i hear you are about to enter into holy mat@@ ri@@ mony with the daughter of my par@@ is@@ hi@@ oner and spiritual son , Prince Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky ? ' he added with a smile . ' a splendid young woman ! '
'@@ Why need he ask me that at confession ? ' he thought .
and as if in answer to the thought , the priest said :
'@@ You are about to enter into mat@@ ri@@ mony and God may give you children , is it not so ?
will you really say to him , " I don '@@ t know " ?
you C@@ AN@@ NOT help knowing , since God in His great mercy has revealed it to you .
or your child may ask you , " What awaits me beyond the tomb ? "
how will you answer him ?
that is wrong ! ' the priest ceased and , with his head on one side , regarded Levin with mild kindly eyes .
when he got home that day Levin felt relieved at having done with an unpleasant episode in such a way that he had not been obliged to tell lies .
'@@ of course , not now , ' thought he , ' but later on . '
Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich was in the best of spirits and was tic@@ k@@ led by Kat@@ av@@ asov 's originality .
Kat@@ av@@ asov , feeling that his originality was observed and appreciated , showed it off .
Chi@@ ri@@ kov g@@ aily and good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ure@@ dly backed up every one else .
'@@ There now ! ' said Kat@@ av@@ asov with a draw@@ l , a habit he had fallen into when lec@@ turing . ' what a talented fellow our friend Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich used to be !
'@@ i have never come across a more@@ . decided foe of marriage than yourself , ' remarked Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich .
'@@ no . I am no foe of marriage , but I believe in division of labour !
persons who can do nothing else must make men , and the others must help them to culture and happiness .
there are hosts of aspir@@ ants who aim at mixing those two professions but I am not one of them ! '
do you know , ' said Levin turning to his brother , ' Kat@@ av@@ asov is writing a work on nutri@@ ment and ... '
what does it matter what I write about ?
'@@ But they would not prevent you loving a wife ! '
'@@ Why ? '
now you like farming sport ... Well , you just wait and see ! '
'@@ You know , Ark@@ hip came to @@@ -@@ @ day to say that in P@@ rud@@ noye there are lots of el@@ k and two bears , ' said Chi@@ ri@@ kov .
'@@ Well , you 'll have to get them without me . '
'@@ There you are ! ' said Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich . ' good @@@ -@@ @ bye to bear @@@ -@@ @ hunting in future ! your wife won '@@ t allow it . '
Levin smiled .
the idea that his wife would not allow it seemed so agre@@ eable that he was prepared to for@@ go the pleasure of ever setting eyes on a bear again .
'@@ all the same , it 's a pity that those two bears will be killed without you .
do you remember that time in H@@ ap@@ il@@ ovka ?
what fine sport we had ! ' said Chi@@ ri@@ kov .
Levin did not wish to deprive him of the illusion that some @@@ -@@ @ where there could be something good without her , therefore he said nothing .
'@@ This custom of taking leave of c@@ eli@@ b@@ acy is not without its reason , ' said Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich . ' however happy you may be , you can '@@ t help regre@@ tting your freedom . '
'@@ Now confess that you feel like the bri@@ deg@@ room in Go@@ gol 's play who jumped out of the window ? ' te@@ ased Chi@@ ri@@ kov .
'@@ of course he feels so , but won '@@ t own up , ' said Kat@@ av@@ asov , and burst out laughing .
'@@ Well , the window is open ...
let us be off to Tver .
and leave them to do as they please here , ' said Chi@@ ri@@ kov , smiling .
'@@ i am ready to swear I can '@@ t find in my soul a trace of regret for my freedom , ' said Levin , with a smile .
'@@ ah , but your soul is in such chaos at the present moment that you are unable to find anything there ! wait till you 've settled down a bit , then you 'll find it , ' said Kat@@ av@@ asov .
'@@ no , I should even now have some consciousness that despite my feelings ' ( he did not wish in Kat@@ av@@ asov 's presence to use the word love ) ' and my happiness I was yet sorry to lose my freedom .
'@@ Very bad !
a hopeless case ! ' said Kat@@ av@@ asov . ' well , let us drink to his recovery , or let us wish that at least a hundre@@ d@@ th part of his dreams come true .
even that will be such joy as was never seen on earth ! '
soon after dinner the visitors left to get ready for the wedding .
when he was alone , Levin , thinking over the remarks of the three bac@@ hel@@ ors , once more asked himself whether there was in his soul any of that regret for his freedom that they had been speaking about .
the question made him smile .
happiness consists only in loving and desi@@ ring : in wishing her wishes and in thinking her thoughts , which means having no freedom whatever ; that is happiness ! '
'@@ But do I know her thoughts , wishes , or feelings ? ' a voice suddenly whispered .
the smile faded from his face and he pon@@ dered .
he was possessed by fear and doubt , doubt of everything .
sup@@ posing she is only mar@@ rying me just to get married ?
sup@@ posing she does not herself know what she is doing ? ' he asked himself . ' she might be@@ think herself and only when she is already married find out that she does not and never could love me ... '
and strange and most evil thoughts about her came into his mind .
he became jeal@@ ous of V@@ ron@@ sky just as he had been the year before , as if it had been but yesterday that he saw her with him .
suddenly he jumped up .
'@@ no , this won '@@ t do ! ' he said to himself des@@ pair@@ ingly . ' I will go to her and tell her for the last time that we are now free , and that perhaps we had better keep so !
anything would be better than continual shame , misery , in@@ fidelity ! '
with his heart full of despair and bitterness toward every one , toward himself and her , he left the hotel and went to her .
she was sitting on a trunk and making some arrangements with one of the m@@ aids , sorting a pile of differently coloured dresses that hung over the backs of chairs or lay on the floor .
and I am sorting my old dresses to give them away ... '
'@@ ah , that is very nice ; ' he said glo@@ om@@ ily , with a glance at the maid .
I will call you , ' said Kit@@ ty . ' what is the matter with you ? ' she asked as soon as the maid was gone .
I C@@ AN@@ NOT bear it alone , ' he cried in a des@@ pairing tone , standing before her and looking impl@@ or@@ ingly into her eyes .
'@@ i have come to say that there is still time ...
what is the matter with you ? ' ' what I have said a thousand times and C@@ AN@@ NOT help thinking - that I am not worthy of you !
it C@@ AN@@ NOT be that you have agreed to marry me .
you C@@ AN@@ NOT love me ? ...
I ... you 'd better tell me ... ' he went on without looking at her . ' I shall be unhappy , of course .
let them all say what they like : anything is better than the mis@@ fortune ...
'@@ i don '@@ t understand , ' she said , thoroughly frightened . ' do you mean you refuse ... Why stop ... ? '
'@@ Yes , if you don '@@ t love me . '
'@@ are you mad ? ' she exclaimed , fl@@ ushing with v@@ ex@@ ation ; but his face was so pit@@ eous that she suppressed her v@@ ex@@ ation , and throwing the dresses on a chair sat down closer to him .
'@@ What are you thinking about ? tell me everything . '
what could you love me for ? '
'@@ o God , what can I do ... ' she cried , and began to we@@ ep .
'@@ Oh , what have I done ! ' he exclaimed , and kne@@ eling before her he began kis@@ sing her hands .
this seemed quite clear to him .
'@@ How is it you don '@@ t understand ?
I have considered it all . '
'@@ She has scarcely eaten anything all these days and has grown quite plain ; and here you come and upset her with your nonsense ! ' said she . ' be off , be off , my dear ! '
guilty and ashamed , but comfor@@ ted , Levin returned to his hotel .
his brother , Dol@@ ly , and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , all in evening dress , were waiting to bless him with the icon .
then a carriage had to be sent to fetch the gro@@ om@@ sman , and another was to take Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich and return again .
altogether there were many complicated arrangements to consider .
one thing was certain : there was no time to be lost , for it was already half @@@ -@@ @ past six .
the Bless@@ ing was not a success .
'@@ Then this is what we must do : you go and fetch him in our carriage , and Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich , if he will be so kind , will go first and will send the carriage back . '
'@@ of course , I shall be very pleased ! '
'@@ And we will follow immediately with him ...
have your tr@@ unks been sent off ? ' inqui@@ red O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
those who had arrived too late to get into the middle of the thr@@ ong pressed round the windows , pushing and disput@@ ing and trying to peer in between the bars .
more than twenty carriages had already been ranged along the street by the mounted police .
a police @@@ -@@ @ officer , un@@ mindful of the frost , stood at the entrance looking brilliant in his blue uniform .
more carriages kept driving up , and now ladies with flowers in their hair got out , holding up their trains ; or men appeared who do@@ ffed their military caps or black hats as they entered the church .
every time the door cre@@ aked every one turned round , expecting to see the bride and bri@@ deg@@ room enter .
at first they expected the bride and bri@@ deg@@ room to enter at any moment , and attached no importance to the delay .
then they turned more and more often toward the door , wondering whether anything had happened .
at length the delay became awkward , and the friends and relatives tried to look as if they were not thinking about the bride and bri@@ deg@@ room but were absorbed in their conversations .
the arch@@ de@@ acon , as if to draw attention to the value of his time , c@@ ough@@ ed impati@@ ently , making the windows vibr@@ ate .
the priest continually sent a chan@@ ter or de@@ acon to see whether the bri@@ deg@@ room had arrived , and he himself , in his purple sur@@ pl@@ ice with the embroi@@ dered gir@@ dle , went with increasing frequency to the side door in expectation of the bri@@ deg@@ room .
at last one of the ladies looked at her watch and said , ' Well , this is strange ! ' and then all the guests became rest@@ less and expressed their surprise and dissatisfaction aloud .
the best man went to find out what had occurred .
Levin meanwhile , in trous@@ ers but without coat or wai@@ st@@ coat , was pac@@ ing up and down his room , perpet@@ ually putting his head out at the door and gl@@ ancing up the corridor .
but in the corridor there was nobody , and in despair he returned and addressed O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , who was quietly smoking .
'@@ Was ever a man in such a terribly idi@@ otic position ' he demanded .
'@@ Yes , it is stupid , ' O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky con@@ cur@@ red with a soo@@ thing smile . ' but don '@@ t worry , it will be here in a minute . '
'@@ Oh , how can I help it ? ' said Levin with suppressed fury . ' and these idi@@ otic open wai@@ st@@ coats - it 's impossible ! '
he glanced at his crum@@ pled shirt @@@ -@@ @ front . ' and suppose the things have already gone to the station ! ' he exclaimed in despair .
the fact of the matter was that when Levin told his old servant Kuz@@ ma to get his things ready , Kuz@@ ma had duly brought his dress coat , wai@@ st@@ coat and what else he considered necessary .
'@@ You 've got it on , ' Kuz@@ ma replied with a quiet smile .
the shirt Levin had been wearing since the morning was crum@@ pled and quite un@@ fit to wear with the fashionable low @@@ -@@ @ cut wai@@ st@@ coat .
meantime in the church every one was waiting for the bri@@ deg@@ room ; while he was pac@@ ing up and down like a c@@ aged beast , looking des@@ pair@@ ingly along the corridor , remembering all he had said to Kit@@ ty and wondering what she must be thinking now .
at last the guilty Kuz@@ ma , quite out of breath , rushed in with the shirt .
'@@ Only just in time - they were ho@@ ist@@ ing the trunk into the cart , ' he gas@@ ped .
three minutes later Levin , not looking at the clock to avoid up@@ setting himself still more , ran as fast as he could down the corridor .
'@@ That won '@@ t help matters , ' remarked O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , smiling and following without ha@@ ste . ' it will all " shape itself , " all " shape itself ' ... I assure you ! '
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky told his wife the reason of the delay , and the guests smiled and whispered to one another .
Levin saw no one and nothing ; he did not take his eyes off his bride .
every one said she had grown plain@@ er during the last few days , and in her bri@@ dal dress was nothing like so pretty as usual ; but Levin thought otherwise .
'@@ i thought you meant to run away , ' she said , smiling at him .
'@@ It was such a stupid thing that happened ! I am ashamed to tell it , ' he said with a bl@@ ush , and was obliged to turn round to the approaching Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich .
'@@ Nice story that , about your shirt ! ' said Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich with a smile and shake of the head .
'@@ Yes , yes ! ' answered Levin , unable to understand what was being said .
'@@ Now then , Ko@@ st@@ ya ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , fe@@ igning con@@ ster@@ nation . ' you 've got to decide an important point , and you 're in exactly the right frame of mind to appreciate its importance .
I have been asked whether you will have new candles or used ones to hold ?
the difference is ten roubles , ' he added , p@@ uck@@ ering his lips into a smile . ' I have settled it , but perhaps you will not be satisfied . '
though he knew it was a joke , Levin could not smile .
'@@ Yes , yes ! fresh ones . '
'@@ Kit@@ ty , mind you step first upon the mat ! ' said Countess Nord@@ ston , coming up to them . ' you are a fine fellow ! ' she added , addressing Levin .
'A@@ ren '@@ t you frightened ? ' asked Kit@@ ty 's old aunt Mary Dmitri@@ evna .
wait a moment , put your head down , ' said Kit@@ ty 's sister , Princess L@@ v@@ ova , and raising her pl@@ ump , beautiful arms she adjusted the flowers on Kit@@ ty 's head .
Dol@@ ly advanced and was about to say something , but could not speak and began crying and laughing in an un@@ natural manner .
the priest turned to Levin and said something that Levin did not hear .
when at last he had taken her hand properly , the priest went a few steps in front of them and halted at the lec@@ tern .
the crowd of friends and relatives , their voices bu@@ zz@@ ing and the ladies ' trains ru@@ st@@ ling , moved after them .
some one sto@@ op@@ ed down to arrange the bride 's veil .
the church became so quiet that the drops of wax were heard falling from the candles .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky stepped up cauti@@ ously , whispered something to him , made a sign to Levin , and stepped back again .
the priest lit two wax candles decorated with flowers , and holding them as@@ ke@@ w in his left hand so that the wax kept slowly dri@@ pping , turned to the young couple .
it was the same priest who had heard Levin 's confession .
then he gave them the candles , took the cen@@ ser , and slowly stepped away from them .
'@@ is it really true ? ' thought Levin , and glanced round at his bride .
he could see her profile slightly from above , and by the just percep@@ tible movements of her lips and ey@@ el@@ ashes he knew she was aware of his look .
she did not turn , but her high fr@@ illed collar moved , rising to her pink little ear .
he saw that a sigh had been suppressed within her breast and that the little hand in its long g@@ love holding the candle trem@@ bled .
all the worry about his shirt , his lat@@ eness , the conversation of their relatives , their dis@@ pleasure and his ridiculous mis@@ ha@@ p , suddenly vanished from his mind and he felt happy though scared .
the handsome , tall senior de@@ acon in a silver cloth AL@@ B , his cur@@ led hair parted down the middle , came b@@ ris@@ kly forward lifting his stole with a practi@@ sed movement of two fingers , and stopped opposite the priest .
'@@ B@@ less us , Lord ! ' slowly succeeding one another , and vibr@@ at@@ ingly reson@@ ant , came the solemn tones .
'@@ Bless@@ ed be our God , now and here@@ after , for ever and ever ! ' replied the old priest me@@ ek@@ ly , in a sing @@@ -@@ @ song voice , continuing to turn something over on the lec@@ tern .
then , harmon@@ iously filling the whole church from windows to v@@ aulted roof , a full ch@@ ord sung by the invisible choir rose , sw@@ elled , hung for a moment , and softly died away .
there were prayers as usual for the world above , for salvation , for the Sy@@ nod , for the Emperor , and also for the servants of God that day wed@@ ded , Constan@@ tine and Catherine .
'@@ Let us pray to the Lord that He may send them perfect love , peace , and help ! ' the whole church seemed to breathe with the senior de@@ acon 's voice .
'@@ How did they find out that it is help , exactly help that I need ? ' he wondered , remembering his late fears and doubts .
'@@ What do I know ? what can I do in this awful matter without help ?
help is exactly what I need now ! '
looking round he met her eyes .
from the expression in them he concluded that she understood them as he did ; but this was not so .
she understood hardly anything of the service and was not even listening to the words of the ceremony .
she could neither listen nor understand , so deep was the one feeling that filled her soul and became ever stronger and stronger .
it was a feeling of joy at the fru@@ ition of what had been for the last month and a half going on in her soul , of that which for those six weeks had gl@@ add@@ ened and tortured her .
at one moment she was horri@@ fied at this indifference , and the next moment rejo@@ iced at that which caused her indifference .
she could not think of or desire anything but life with this man ; but , as that life had not yet begun , she could not even clearly picture it to herself .
there was only anticipation , fear , and joy at something new and unknown ; and now at any moment the anticipation and uncertainty , and the remor@@ se at repudi@@ ating her former life , would all come to an end and something new would begin .
again turning to the reading @@@ -@@ @ desk the priest with some difficulty picked up Kit@@ ty 's little ring , and asking Levin for his hand put the ring on the tip of his finger .
several times the couple tried to guess what was expected of them , and bl@@ under@@ ed each time , the priest prompting them in whis@@ pers .
Dol@@ ly , Chi@@ ri@@ kov , and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky came forward to help them .
he felt that any kind of smile would hurt their feelings .
all Moscow , including both relatives and friends , had congre@@ gated in the church .
in the circle nearest the bride were her two sisters , Dol@@ ly the elder and the calm and beautiful Princess L@@ v@@ ova , who had come from abroad .
'@@ Why is Marie in l@@ il@@ ac ? it 's almost as un@@ suitable at a wedding as black , ' remarked Mrs. Kor@@ sun@@ skaya .
'@@ With her compl@@ exi@@ on it 's her only salvation , ' replied Princess D@@ rub@@ et@@ skaya . ' I wonder they are having the wedding in the evening , like trad@@ es@@ people . '
I was married in the evening too , ' answered Mrs. Kor@@ sun@@ skaya , and sigh@@ ed as she remembered how sweet she had looked that day , how fun@@ n@@ ily enam@@ oured her husband then was , and how different things were now .
she answered only with a smile .
she was looking at Kit@@ ty and thinking of the time when she would be standing there beside Count Sin@@ y@@ av@@ in , just as Kit@@ ty now stood , and how she would then remind him of his joke .
young Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky told the old M@@ aid of Hon@@ our Nikol@@ ay@@ eva that he intended to put the crown on Kit@@ ty 's ch@@ ig@@ non , to make her happy .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev was talking to Dol@@ ly , jo@@ kingly assuring her that the custom of going away after the wedding was spreading because newly @@@ -@@ @ married couples always felt rather uncomfortable .
'@@ Your brother has a right to feel proud .
'@@ i am past all that , Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na , ' he answered , and his face became unexpectedly sad and serious .
'@@ i must put her w@@ reat@@ h straight , ' she replied , without listening .
'@@ What a pity she has grown so much plain@@ er ! ' remarked Countess Nord@@ ston to the Princess L@@ v@@ ova . ' all the same he is not worth her little finger .
'@@ no , I like him very much , and not just because he will be my brother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law , ' answered the Princess . ' how well he behaves !
and it is so difficult to behave well under these circumstances , and not be ridiculous - and he is not ridiculous or stiff , and is evidently touched . '
'@@ i suppose you quite expected this ? '
'@@ Well , let us see which of them will step first on the mat !
'@@ It does not matter , ' replied Princess L@@ v@@ ova . ' we are all sub@@ missive wives , it is in our nature . '
'@@ Well , I stepped on the mat before Vasily !
and you , Dol@@ ly ? '
Dol@@ ly , who was standing near , heard , but did not reply .
her eyes were mo@@ ist and she could not have spoken without bur@@ sting into tears .
she rejo@@ iced at the sight of Kit@@ ty and Levin , but going back to the past she thought of her own wedding , kept gl@@ ancing at the be@@ aming O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , and , forgetting the present , recoll@@ ected nothing but her own young and innocent love .
she too had once stood with veiled head , pure and crowned with orange blos@@ som .
'@@ And now ? how strange ! ' she mur@@ mu@@ red .
'@@ And is that her sister in white s@@ atin ? ...
now hear how the de@@ acon will ro@@ ar , " Wi@@ ves , obey your husbands " ! '
'@@ i asked the foot@@ man .
'@@ There now , Mary Vas@@ ily@@ evna ! you were maintaining that cr@@ in@@ ol@@ ines were being worn ful@@ ler at the back !
just look at that one in the pu@@ ce dress - an ambassador 's wife , they say .
'@@ What a dar@@ ling the bride is , like a lamb dec@@ ked for the slaughter !
so ch@@ attered the crowd of women who had managed to get inside the church .
after the usual questions of whether they wished to be married and whether they had promised themselves to others , and their answers , which sounded strange to themselves , the second part of the service began .
Kit@@ ty listened to the words of the prayer , trying to comprehend their meaning but unable to do so .
triumph and radiant joy filled her heart more and more as the ceremony proceeded , and made it impossible for her to be attentive .
they prayed : ' that they may live in ch@@ asti@@ ty for the good of the fruits of the womb , and find joy in their sons and daughters . '
'@@ It is all very beautiful , ' thought Kit@@ ty as she heard these words , ' and could not be different . ' and a smile of joy , which involun@@ tarily communicated itself to all who regarded her , shone on her radiant face .
'@@ P@@ ut it quite on ! ' came the words of advice when the priest had put crow@@ ns on their heads and Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky , his hand in its three @@@ -@@ @ but@@ t@@ oned g@@ love trembling , held the crown high above Kit@@ ty 's head .
'@@ P@@ ut it on , ' she whispered , smiling .
Levin glanced round at her , was struck by the joy@@ ous radi@@ ance of her face , and was involun@@ tarily infected by her feeling .
he felt bright and joy@@ ous as she did .
with light hearts they heard the E@@ pist@@ le read and the roll of the senior de@@ acon 's voice in the last verse , for which the outsiders present had been waiting impati@@ ently .
young Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky and Chi@@ ri@@ kov , who were supporting the crow@@ ns and getting ent@@ angled in the bride 's train , smiled too and were pleased without knowing why , when they chan@@ ced to lag behind or jo@@ st@@ le the young couple if the priest happened to stop .
the spark of joy that was glowing in Kit@@ ty 's heart seemed to have spread to every one in the church .
Levin f@@ anci@@ ed that the priest and de@@ acon wanted to smile just as he did .
having lifted the crow@@ ns from their heads , the priest read the last prayer and congratulated the married couple .
Levin glanced at Kit@@ ty and thought he had never seen her like that before , so enchan@@ ting with the new light of happiness ir@@ radi@@ ating her face .
he wished to speak to her , but did not know whether it was all over yet .
the priest helped him out of the difficulty , saying softly , with a smile on his kindly mouth , ' K@@ iss your wife ; and you , kiss your husband ! ' he took the candles from their hands .
Levin kis@@ sed her carefully on her smiling lips , offered his arm , and with a feeling of strange clo@@ seness led her out of the church .
he could not believe it was all true and only realized it when their surprised and tim@@ id g@@ lan@@ ces met and he felt that they were already one .
after sup@@ per that same night the young couple left for the country .
V@@ ron@@ sky AND AN@@ NA H@@ AD AL@@ RE@@ AD@@ Y BE@@ EN travelling together in Europe for three months .
they had visited Venice , Rome , and Naples , and had only just reached a small Italian town where they meant to make a longer stay .
the ste@@ ward was ready to sign the contract .
'@@ ah , I am very glad , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky . ' and is the lady in ? '
'@@ the lady has been for a walk , but has now returned , ' replied the wa@@ iter .
V@@ ron@@ sky took off his soft , broad @@@ -@@ @ bri@@ m@@ med hat and wiped his per@@ spir@@ ing forehead and his hair , which he had allowed to grow half @@@ -@@ @ way down his ears and wore br@@ ushed back so as to hide his bal@@ d patch .
after an absent @@@ -@@ @ minded glance at the man who was still standing there watching him , he was about to go in .
'@@ This gentleman is a Russian and was asking about you , ' said the head @@@ -@@ @ wa@@ iter .
it was really Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev , his fellow @@@ -@@ @ student in the Corps des Pages .
in the Corps Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev had been a Liberal , had left the Corps a civilian , and had never served .
on leaving the Corps the two friends had separated and had met but once since then .
on that occasion V@@ ron@@ sky found that Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev had chosen some high @@@ -@@ @ flown Liberal activity and therefore felt he must desp@@ ise V@@ ron@@ sky 's profession and activities .
and Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev had remained cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ously indifferent to V@@ ron@@ sky 's attitude , so that that meeting ought to have separated them still further .
yet now they bri@@ ghtened up and exclaimed with pleasure at recognizing one another .
V@@ ron@@ sky would never have thought he could be so pleased to see Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev , but probably he was himself unaware how bored he was .
a similar expression of pleasure replaced the former anxious look on Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev 's face .
'@@ How pleased I am to see you ! ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , a friendly smile dis@@ closing his fine white teeth .
'@@ i heard the name of V@@ ron@@ sky but I did not know which V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ Come in !
well , and what are you doing ? '
'@@ Oh , I have been here over a year .
'@@ ah ! ' said V@@ ron@@ sky in an interested tone . ' well , come in . '
and according to the usual way with Russians , instead of saying what he wanted to hide from the servants in Russian , he began speaking French .
'@@ You know Mad@@ ame K@@ aren@@ ina ?
we are travelling together .
I am now going to her , ' he said in French , attentively watching Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev 's expression .
three days , ' answered V@@ ron@@ sky , still attentively scrutin@@ izing his friend 's face .
'@@ Yes , he is a decent fellow and looks at the matter in the right way , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky to himself , understanding the meaning of the other 's look and the change of subject . ' I can introduce him to Anna , as he sees the matter rightly . '
but had he , and those who understood the matter in the ' right ' way , been asked what this understanding amounted to , they would have been much puzzled how to reply .
they pre@@ tended to understand completely the significance and meaning of the situation , to coun@@ tenance and even approve of it , but to consider it out of place and unnecessary to explain all this .
evidently he avoided , without the least effort , everything in conversation that might have sounded awkward .
he had never met Anna before and was struck by her beauty , and still more by the simplicity with which she accepted her position .
she bl@@ ushed when V@@ ron@@ sky showed Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev in , and the child@@ like flush that suff@@ used her open and handsome face pleased him exceedingly .
this straightforward and simple attitude toward her own position pleased Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev .
noticing Anna 's good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured , bright , and energetic manner , he thought that , knowing both K@@ aren@@ in and V@@ ron@@ sky as he did , he quite understood her .
'@@ It is mentioned in the guide @@@ -@@ @ book , ' said Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev , referring to the Pal@@ az@@ zo V@@ ron@@ sky was taking .
'@@ i say , the weather is glorious : let us go and have another look at it , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky to Anna .
'@@ i should like to very much .
I 'll just go and put on my hat . you say it 's hot ' she asked , stopping at the door and looking inqu@@ ir@@ ingly at V@@ ron@@ sky , while a bright flush again suff@@ used her face .
from her look V@@ ron@@ sky understood that she did not yet know what attitude he wished to adopt toward Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev , and was afraid she might not have behaved su@@ itably .
he answered with a long and tender look .
'@@ no , not very hot , ' he said .
she thought she had understood him completely and above all that he was satisfied with her . she gave him a smile and went out with rapid steps .
'@@ Well , and so you have settled down here ? ' said V@@ ron@@ sky in order to begin a conversation .
'@@ You are still busy at the same thing ? ' he went on , recoll@@ ecting that he had heard the other was writing something .
'@@ Yes , I am writing the second part of Two Principles , ' said Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev , fl@@ ushing with pleasure at the question . ' to be quite exact , I mean , I am not yet writing , but am collecting the materials .
we in Russia are slow to realize that we are the inher@@ itors of Byz@@ anti@@ um , ' and he began a long and heated explanation .
at first V@@ ron@@ sky felt uncomfortable because he did not know even the first part of Two Principles , which the author mentioned as if it were well known .
but later on , when Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev began exp@@ ounding his view , and V@@ ron@@ sky was able to follow him , even though he was ignorant of Two Principles he listened with interest , for the man talked well .
yet V@@ ron@@ sky was surprised at , and sorry to see , the irrit@@ able excitement with which Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev spoke on the subject that interested him .
the longer he talked the more his eyes fl@@ ashed , the more hastily he ret@@ or@@ ted on imaginary opponents , and the more ag@@ itated and offended became his face .
remembering him as a thin , active , good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured , and noble boy , always at the head of his class , V@@ ron@@ sky could not understand the cause of the agitation , nor approve of it .
what most dis@@ pleased him was that Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev , a man belonging to good Society , should put himself an the same level with certain scri@@ b@@ blers who irrit@@ ated him and made him angry .
was it worth while ?
he did not like this , but nevertheless he felt that Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev was not happy and he was sorry for him .
after trying several topics of conversation she led him on to the subject of art , about which he talked very well , and listened to him with attention .
'@@ i am very pleased about one thing , ' said Anna to Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev when they had returned to the hotel . ' Alex@@ is will have a nice studio .
'@@ Do you paint ? ' inqui@@ red Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev , turning quickly to V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ Yes , I went in for it long ago , and now have begun a little , ' answered V@@ ron@@ sky with a bl@@ ush .
during TH@@ IS , THE FI@@ R@@ ST PER@@ IO@@ D of her freedom and rapid recovery , Anna was un@@ par@@ don@@ ably happy and full of the joy of life .
on the one hand this memory was too terrible to dwell upon , and on the other hand her husband 's mis@@ fortune had meant for her too great a joy for repentance to be possible .
the memory of the evil done to her husband aroused in her a feeling akin to re@@ pulsion , such as a man might feel who when in danger of drow@@ ning had shaken off another who cl@@ ung to him .
that other was drowned ; of course it was wrong , but it had been the only way of escape and it was better not to recall such terrible details .
one comfor@@ ting reflection about her conduct had come to her in the first moment of the rupture , and when she now remembered the past she also recalled that reflection .
but sincerely as Anna desired to suffer , she was not suffering .
she was not conscious of degradation .
the par@@ ting from her son , whom she loved , did not trouble her at first either .
the little girl , his child , was so sweet , and Anna had grown so attached to her since she was the only child left to her , that she rarely thought of her son .
the desire to live , enhanced by her recovery , was so powerful , and the conditions of her life were so novel and pleasant , that Anna felt un@@ par@@ don@@ ably happy .
the better she knew V@@ ron@@ sky the more she loved him .
she loved him both for his own sake and for his love of her .
to possess him entirely was a continual joy to her .
his near@@ ness was always pleasant .
all the traits of character , with which she became better and better acquainted , seemed in@@ expres@@ sibly delightful .
his appearance , altered by civilian dress , was as attractive to her as to a girl in love .
in all he said , thought , or did , she saw something peculi@@ arly noble and exalted .
she dared not let him see her consciousness of her own inferi@@ ority .
to her it seemed that if he knew of it he would the sooner cease to love her , and there was nothing she now feared more - though she had no reason to do so - than the loss of his love .
but she could not help being grateful to him for his treatment of her , and showing him how much she valued it .
he was even more lov@@ ingly respectful to her than before , and the thought that she must never be allowed to feel the awk@@ wardness of her situation never left his mind for a moment .
he , so vir@@ ile a man , not only never contradic@@ ted her , but where she was concerned seemed to have no will of his own and to be only occupied in anticipating her every wish .
she could not help appreci@@ ating this , although his strained attenti@@ veness , the atmosphere of solic@@ itude with which he surrounded her , became bur@@ den@@ some at times .
V@@ ron@@ sky meanwhile , in spite of the complete fulfilment of what he had so long desired , was not completely happy .
he soon felt that the realization of his longing gave him only one grain of the mountain of bliss he had anticipated .
that realization showed him the eternal error men make by imag@@ ining that happiness consists in the grati@@ fication of their wishes .
soon he felt rising in his soul a desire for desires - boredom .
involun@@ tarily he began to s@@ nat@@ ch at every passing cap@@ rice , mist@@ aking it for a desire and a purpose .
sixteen hours daily had to be filled somehow , living abroad as they did completely at liberty , quite cut off from the round of social life that had filled his time in Petersburg .
intercourse with local Society or with the Russians was , in consequence of the inde@@ fin@@ it@@ eness of their relation , likewise impossible .
sight @@@ -@@ @ seeing , apart from the fact that he had already seen everything , had for him - a Russian and an intelligent man - none of that in@@ expl@@ icable importance the English manage to attach to it .
as a hungry animal se@@ izes every object it meets , hoping to find food in it , so V@@ ron@@ sky unconsciously seized now on politics , now on new books , now on pictures .
the role V@@ ron@@ sky had chosen , with their removal to the Pal@@ az@@ zo , was quite successful ; and having through Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev made the acquaintance of several interesting persons , he felt tran@@ qui@@ l for a time .
he painted studies from nature under the direction of an Italian professor , and studied Italian life in the Middle Ages .
medi@@ a@@ eval Italian life had at that time become so fascinating to him that he even began to wear his hat and throw his cloak across his shoulder in a medi@@ a@@ eval manner which was very becoming to him .
the article repro@@ ached the Government and the Academy for leaving a remarkable artist without encouragement or help .
'@@ i have , ' answered Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev . ' of course he is not without talent , but his tendency is quite a false one .
he has that Ivanov @@@ -@@ @ Strauss @@@ -@@ @ Ren@@ an attitude toward Christ 's and religious art . '
led on by this question about the subject of the picture to one of his favourite topics , he began to explain .
'@@ i can '@@ t understand how one can make so gross an error !
they choose the one person who must not be chosen as a subject for art , and then ... '
have you seen his portrait of Vas@@ il@@ ch@@ ik@@ ova ?
but it seems he does not want to paint any more portraits , so it is possible he may be in want .
I say that ... '
'@@ C@@ oul@@ d@@ n '@@ t one ask him to paint Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna 's portrait ? ' said V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ Why mine ? ' said Anna . ' after the one you painted I want no other .
'@@ There she is ! ' she added , looking from the window at the beautiful Italian nurse who had taken the baby into the garden , and then immediately gl@@ ancing round at V@@ ron@@ sky .
the beautiful nurse , whose head V@@ ron@@ sky was painting for his picture , was the only and secret sorrow of Anna 's life .
V@@ ron@@ sky painted her , admired her beauty and her ' medi@@ a@@ ev@@ al@@ ness , ' and Anna dared not confess to herself that she was afraid of being jeal@@ ous of the nurse ; so she treated the woman with special kindness and spo@@ ilt her and her little son .
V@@ ron@@ sky too looked out of the window and into Anna 's eyes , and at once turned to Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev saying :
'@@ i have met him .
but he is a c@@ rank and quite un@@ educated .
you know , he is one of those he@@ ath@@ en@@ ish new folk one so often meets nowadays ; you know ! one of those fre@@ e@@ thinkers who have been brought up from the beginning in dis@@ belief , neg@@ ation , and materialism .
he is one of these .
he is the son of a head foot@@ man , I think , and has had no education .
when he entered the Academy and won a reputation for himself he , not being stupid , wanted to get same education .
so he resorted to what seemed to him to be the well@@ spring of education - the magazines .
but among us at the present day he tum@@ bled straight into the literature of neg@@ ation and rapidly assimil@@ ated the essence of the negative teaching , and there he was !
in my article I ... '
Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev pulled himself up and un@@ willingly agreed , but as the artist lived in a distant part of the town they decided to hire a carriage .
an hour later Anna , seated beside Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev with V@@ ron@@ sky facing them , drove to a new ugly house in a distant quarter of the town .
Mikha@@ y@@ lov , THE artist , W@@ AS AT W@@ ORK as usual when V@@ ron@@ sky 's and Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev 's cards were brought him .
every morning he worked in the studio at his big picture .
on returning home he had been angry with his wife because she had not managed to paci@@ fy the land@@ lady , who clam@@ oured for the rent .
'@@ Have I not told you scores of times not to enter upon discussions ?
at best you are only a fool , and when you begin arguing in Italian you become a tre@@ ble fool ! ' he said at the end of a long dispute .
'@@ Then you shoul@@ d@@ n '@@ t get into arrears !
'@@ Sh@@ ut up , for heaven 's sake ! ' cried Mikha@@ y@@ lov with tears in his voice , stopping his ears with his hands as he went into his work@@ room behind a partition and locked the door behind him .
'@@ What a du@@ ff@@ er ! ' he mut@@ tered to himself as he seated himself at the table , and having opened a portfolio he at once set to work with particular ard@@ our at an unfinished drawing .
he never worked with such ard@@ our or so successfully as when things were going badly with him , and especially after a quarrel with his wife .
'@@ Oh dear ! if only I could escape somewhere ! ' he thought as he worked .
he was sket@@ ching the figure of a man in a fit of anger .
he had sket@@ ched him before , but had been dissatisfied with the result .
'@@ no , the other one was better ...
he went back to his wife , and fro@@ w@@ ning , without looking at her , asked his el@@ dest little girl where the paper was that he had given them .
nevertheless , he took it , put it on his table , and , stepping backward and scre@@ wing up his eyes , began examining it .
suddenly he smiled and flung up his arms joy@@ fully .
'@@ That 's it ! that 's it ! ' he said , and taking up his pencil he began drawing rapidly .
he copied that new pose , and , suddenly remembering the energetic pose and prominent chin of a shop@@ man from whom he had bought ci@@ gars , he gave the figure that man 's face and chin .
he laughed with joy , for the in@@ anim@@ ate , un@@ natural figure had become alive , and was just the thing .
the figure was alive , clear , and well @@@ -@@ @ defined .
but while making these corrections he did not alter the pose but only removed what interfer@@ ed with its character .
'@@ Direc@@ tly ! directly ! '
he went out to his wife .
'@@ Come , Sasha , don '@@ t he angry , ' he said , smiling tim@@ idly and ten@@ derly . ' you were wrong and so was I. I 'll settle it all ! '
having made it up with his wife he put on an olive @@@ -@@ @ green over@@ coat with a vel@@ vet collar , and a hat , and went to the studio .
his successful drawing was already forgotten .
now he was pleased and excited by the visit to his studio of these grand Russians who had come in a carriage .
about his picture - the one at present on the eas@@ el - he had at the bottom of his heart a firm opinion : that no one had ever painted anything like it .
he did not consider his picture better than all Rap@@ hael 's , but he knew that what he wanted to express in that picture had never yet been expressed by anyone .
every remark , even the most trivial , which showed that those who judged it saw even but a small part of what he himself saw in it , moved him deeply .
the visitors , already dis@@ enchan@@ ted by Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev 's account of the artist , were still further disillu@@ sioned by his appearance .
'@@ Come in , please ! ' he said , trying to put on an air of indifference , as he entered the hall and took a key from his pocket to unlock the door .
on ENT@@ ER@@ ING H@@ IS ST@@ U@@ DI@@ O the artist again cast a glance at his visitors and took note of V@@ ron@@ sky 's face , especially his jaw .
a mass of hair and a very open forehead gave a superficial significance to that face , which had an insignificant chil@@ dish , rest@@ less expression concentrated in the narrow bridge of the nose .
V@@ ron@@ sky and Anna , according to Mikha@@ y@@ lov 's conception , were in all probability distinguished wealthy Russians , who like all these wealthy Russians compreh@@ ended nothing of art but pre@@ tended to be amate@@ urs and critics .
'@@ There ! ' he said , stepping aside with his loose g@@ ait , and pointing to the picture .
'@@ This is Pil@@ ate 's Ad@@ mon@@ ition - Matthew , chapter XX@@ VII . , ' he went on , conscious that his lips were beginning to trem@@ ble with excitement ; and he stepped behind the visitors .
during the few moments that they were silently gaz@@ ing at it , Mikha@@ y@@ lov also regarded it with the indifferent eye of a stranger .
in those few moments he believed in advance that the highest and ju@@ st@@ est of critic@@ isms was going to be pronounced by these very visitors whom he had so desp@@ ised a moment before .
he saw in the fore@@ ground Pil@@ ate 's v@@ exed face and Christ 's calm one , and behind them the faces of Pil@@ ate 's servants and of John , watching what was taking place .
he saw a well @@@ -@@ @ painted - and not even that , for he detected a multitude of errors - repetition of those innumerable Ch@@ rists : T@@ iti@@ an 's , Rap@@ hael 's , Rub@@ ens 's , with the same warriors and the same Pil@@ ates .
it was trivial , poor , old , and even badly painted , weak and lacking harmony .
they would be in the right when they began to say fal@@ sely @@@ -@@ @ polite things in the presence of the artist , and to pity and laugh at him behind his back .
the silence grew too un@@ bearable , though it had not lasted more than a minute .
to break it and to appear calm , he made an effort and addressed Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev .
'@@ i think I have had the pleasure of meeting you ? ' he said , gl@@ ancing un@@ easily now at Anna and now at V@@ ron@@ sky , in order not to lose any detail of their expressions .
noticing , however , that Mikha@@ y@@ lov was waiting to hear his criticism of the picture , he said :
'@@ Your picture has progressed very much since I last saw it , and now , as then , I am specially struck by the figure of Pil@@ ate .
one can so well understand that man , a kind , first @@@ -@@ @ rate fellow , but an official to his very backbone , who does not know what he is doing .
the whole of Mikha@@ y@@ lov 's mobile face suddenly lighted up .
his eyes bri@@ ghtened . he wanted to speak but was too ag@@ itated , and pre@@ tended to cough instead .
the fact that this opinion was but one of a million of other opinions which - as Mikha@@ y@@ lov well knew - would all have been just did not for him de@@ tract from the importance of Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev 's remark .
he took a liking for Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev because of that remark , and his depression changed suddenly into delight .
in an instant his whole picture became alive before his eyes , with the in@@ expres@@ sible complexity of everything that lives .
he wished to say that it was just so that he understood Pil@@ ate , but his trembling lips would not obey him and he was unable to speak .
Mikha@@ y@@ lov thought that on them too the picture had created an impression , and went up to them .
'@@ How wonderful Christ 's expression is ! ' said Anna .
this too was one of a million just remarks which might have been made with reference to his picture and the figure of Christ .
in Christ 's expression there should be pity because there was love in it , a peace not of this world , a readiness for death , and a knowledge of the van@@ ity of words .
of course there was an official expression in Pil@@ ate 's face and pity in Christ 's , for the former was the embodiment of car@@ nal and the latter of spiritual life .
all this and much more floated through Mikha@@ y@@ lov 's mind ; and again his face shone with ecstasy .
'@@ Yes , and how well that figure is done , and what an atmosphere there is !
one could walk round it , ' said Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev , showing evidently by this remark that he did not approve of the content and idea of the figure .
'@@ Yes , it is wonder@@ fully mast@@ erly ! how those figures in the background stand out !
that is technique , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , addressing Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev and allu@@ ding to a conversation they had had about V@@ ron@@ sky 's despair of attaining technical mastery .
'@@ Yes , yes , wonderful ! ' chim@@ ed in Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev and Anna .
in spite of his elation , this remark about technique gr@@ ated painfully on Mikha@@ y@@ lov 's heart , and , gl@@ ancing an@@ gr@@ ily at V@@ ron@@ sky , he suddenly fro@@ w@@ ned .
he often heard the word technique mentioned , and did not at all understand what was meant by it .
he knew it meant a mechanical capacity to paint and draw , quite independent of the subject @@@ -@@ @ matter .
he had often noticed - as now when his picture was being praised - that technique was contr@@ asted with inner quality , as if it were possible to paint well something that was bad .
if the things he saw had been revealed to a little child , or to his cook , they would have been able to remove the outer shell from their idea .
and the most experienced and technical painter could never paint anything by means of mechanical skill alone , if the outline of the subject @@@ -@@ @ matter did not first reveal itself to his mind .
moreover , he saw that if technique were spoken of , then he could not be praised for it .
and in almost all the figures and faces he saw traces of wrap@@ p@@ ings that had not been entirely removed and that spo@@ ilt the picture .
'@@ One thing might be said , if you will allow me to make the remark , ' began Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev .
'@@ Oh , I shall be very pleased : pray do ! ' said Mikha@@ y@@ lov with a fe@@ igned smile .
'@@ It is , that you have made Him a man @@@ -@@ @ God , and not a God @@@ -@@ @ man .
however , I know that you wished to do so . '
'@@ i could not paint a Christ whom I had not in my soul , ' Mikha@@ y@@ lov re@@ joined glo@@ om@@ ily .
'@@ Yes , but in that case , if I may say what I think ...
your picture is so good that a remark of mine C@@ AN@@ NOT do it any harm , besides which it 's only my personal opinion ... yours is different , the idea itself is different .
but let us take Ivanov , for example .
I consider that if Christ is to be brought down to the level of an historic figure , it would be better to choose another historic theme , a fresh one as yet untouched . '
'@@ But if this is the highest theme open to art ? '
'@@ Other themes can be found if one looks for them .
but the fact is , art won '@@ t stand discussion and argument .
yet Ivanov 's picture suggests both to a believer and an un@@ believer the question : is this a God or not a God ? and the unity of impression is destroyed . '
to me it seems that for educated people such questions can no longer exist , ' said Mikha@@ y@@ lov .
Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev did not agree with this , and keeping to his first contention that unity of impression is indispensable in art , he con@@ fu@@ ted Mikha@@ y@@ lov .
the artist was per@@ tur@@ bed , but could find nothing to say in defence of his opinion .
Anna AND V@@ ron@@ sky H@@ AD LO@@ NG BE@@ EN exchanging g@@ lan@@ ces regre@@ tting their friend 's clever lo@@ qu@@ acity , and at last V@@ ron@@ sky without waiting for his host crossed the room to look at another and smaller picture .
'@@ Oh , how charming ! how charming !
charming ! ' he and Anna began both at once .
'@@ What is it they like so much ? ' wondered Mikha@@ y@@ lov He had forgotten all about that picture , painted three years before .
he had forgotten all the sufferings and rap@@ tures he had gone through on account of that work , when it alone had occupied him un@@ remit@@ tingly day and night for three months . he had forgotten it , as he forgot all his finished pictures .
he did not even like looking at it , and had only brought it out because he was expecting an Englis@@ hman who wished to buy it .
'@@ That 's nothing - only an old study , ' he said .
'@@ How good ! ' remarked Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev , evidently sincerely impressed by the charm of the picture .
it represented two boys ang@@ ling in the shade of a wil@@ low .
what was he thinking about ?
but V@@ ron@@ sky inqui@@ red whether this picture was for sale .
to Mikha@@ y@@ lov , in his excitement over their visit , this mention of money matters was very dis@@ agre@@ eable .
'@@ It is put out for sale , ' he replied , fro@@ w@@ ning dark@@ ly .
when the visitors had left , Mikha@@ y@@ lov sat down before his picture of Pil@@ ate and Christ and mentally reviewed all that had been said , and even what was not said but only hin@@ ted by the visitors .
strange to say , what had had weight with him while they were there and he looked at things from their point of view suddenly lost all significance now .
the fore@@ shor@@ tening of Christ 's foot was , however , not right .
he took his palette and commenced working .
while correcting the foot he kept gl@@ ancing at the figure of John in the background , which the visitors had not even remarked , but which he knew to be the height of perfection .
when he had completed the foot he was about to do something to that figure , but felt that he was too ag@@ itated .
he could work neither when he was too indifferent nor when he was too highly r@@ oused and saw everything too distinctly .
there was only one stage between calm@@ ness and inspiration , at which work was possible , and to @@@ -@@ @ day he was too excited .
he was about to cover his picture , but paused , and holding up the sheet stood a long time with a rap@@ tur@@ ous smile gaz@@ ing at the figure of John .
at length , tearing himself away from it regre@@ tfully , he let the sheet fall over the picture and went home , tired but happy .
V@@ ron@@ sky , Anna , and Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev were particularly animated and high @@@ -@@ @ spir@@ ited on their way back .
they talked about Mikha@@ y@@ lov and his pictures .
they said that it was impossible to deny his talent , but that his talent could not develop because of his lack of education - the common mis@@ fortune of our Russian artists .
but the picture of the boys had gri@@ pped their memories and they kept coming back to it . ' how charming !
how well he has hit it off , and how simply !
he does not even understand how good it is .
yes , we must not miss the opportunity of purchasing it , ' V@@ ron@@ sky declared .
Mikha@@ y@@ lov sold V@@ ron@@ sky THE picture and con@@ s@@ ented to paint Anna 's portrait .
on the appointed day he came and began working .
after the fifth sitting the portrait struck every one not only by its lik@@ eness but also by its beauty .
it was strange that Mikha@@ y@@ lov had been able to discover that special beauty .
'@@ One needed to know and love her as I love her , to find just that sweet@@ est spiritual expression of hers , ' thought V@@ ron@@ sky , though he himself had only learnt to know that ' sweet@@ est spiritual expression ' through the portrait .
but the expression was so true that it seemed both to him and to others that they had always known it .
'@@ How long have I been struggling without accompl@@ ishing anything ? ' he said , referring to the portrait he was painting ; ' and he just looked , and painted this !
'@@ That will come in good time , ' said Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev , consol@@ ingly . in his opinion V@@ ron@@ sky had talent , and especially the education that gives a lofty outlook on art .
Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev 's conviction that V@@ ron@@ sky possessed talent was supported by the fact that he required V@@ ron@@ sky 's sympathy and praise for his articles and ideas , and felt that praise and encouragement should be mutual .
in another man 's house , and particularly in V@@ ron@@ sky 's Pal@@ az@@ zo , Mikha@@ y@@ lov was quite a different man from what he was in his studio .
he was un@@ pleas@@ antly de@@ fer@@ ential , as if fearful of intim@@ acy with persons whom he did not respect .
he addressed V@@ ron@@ sky as ' Your Excell@@ ency , ' and never stayed to dinner , though Anna and V@@ ron@@ sky both invited him , and he never came except for a sitting .
Anna was even kin@@ der to him than to others , and was grateful for her portrait .
V@@ ron@@ sky was more than polite to him , and was evidently interested in the artist 's opinion of his ( V@@ ron@@ sky 's ) picture .
Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev never missed an opportunity to insti@@ l into Mikha@@ y@@ lov a true understanding of art .
but the latter remained equally cold toward them all .
Anna felt by his look that he liked looking at her , but he avoided conversation with her .
when V@@ ron@@ sky talked about his art Mikha@@ y@@ lov remained stubbor@@ nly silent , and as stubbor@@ nly silent when they showed him V@@ ron@@ sky 's picture , and he was evidently oppressed by Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev 's dis@@ courses , to which he made no re@@ join@@ der .
Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev was the first to express the thought that was in all their minds , namely , that Mikha@@ y@@ lov was simply jeal@@ ous of V@@ ron@@ sky .
especially , there is the education which he lacks . '
V@@ ron@@ sky took Mikha@@ y@@ lov 's part , but in the depth of his heart he believed what Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev said , for he considered that a man of that other and lower world must envy him .
Anna 's portrait , the same subject painted from nature by both of them , should have shown him the difference between Mikha@@ y@@ lov and himself ; but V@@ ron@@ sky did not see it .
he merely left off painting Anna , deciding that it would be super@@ flu@@ ous now .
he went on , however , with his medi@@ a@@ eval picture .
and he , as well as Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev , and especially Anna , thought it very good because it resem@@ bled famous pictures much more than Mikha@@ y@@ lov 's did .
he knew it was not possible to forbid V@@ ron@@ sky to tri@@ fle with art , knew that he and all the dil@@ et@@ t@@ anti had a perfect right to paint what they liked - but to him it was unpleasant .
one C@@ AN@@ NOT forbid a man 's making a big wax doll and kis@@ sing it .
but if the man came and sat down with his doll in front of a lover , and began to ca@@ ress it as the lover ca@@ resses his beloved , it would dis@@ please the lover .
it was this kind of un@@ pleas@@ ant@@ ness that Mikha@@ y@@ lov experienced when he saw V@@ ron@@ sky 's pictures : he was am@@ used , v@@ exed , sorry , and hurt .
he had sufficient taste for art to be unable to finish his picture .
he ceased painting it because he was dim@@ ly conscious that its defects , little noticeable at first , would become striking if he went on .
the same thing happened to him as to Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev , who , feeling that he had nothing to express , continually deceived himself by saying that his thought had not yet ri@@ pen@@ ed and that he was bringing it to maturity and preparing materials .
but Gol@@ en@@ ish@@ chev was em@@ bit@@ tered and tor@@ m@@ ented by it , while V@@ ron@@ sky could not deceive and tor@@ ment himself , and above all could not become em@@ bit@@ tered .
with characteristic firm@@ ness he left off painting , without any explanations or excuses .
so they decided to return to Russia and live in the country .
in Petersburg V@@ ron@@ sky planned to separate his property from his brother 's , and Anna to see her son .
the summer they intended to spend on V@@ ron@@ sky 's large family estate .
Levin H@@ AD BE@@ EN married TH@@ REE months .
he was happy , but in quite a different way from what he had expected .
at every step he met disillu@@ sion@@ ments in his old fan@@ cies and new and unexpected enchan@@ tments .
he was happy , but having embarked on family life he saw at every step that it was not at all what he had anticipated .
at every step he took he felt as a man would feel who , after admir@@ ing the smooth happy motion of a little boat upon the water , had himself got into the boat .
as a bachelor seeing the married life of others - their petty cares , their disputes , their jeal@@ ou@@ sies - he used mentally to smile cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ously .
Levin saw that the arrangement of all those tri@@ fles was not at all so easy as he had formerly supposed .
he should , he thought , do his work , and rest from it in the jo@@ ys of love .
she should be loved - and that was all .
he had been p@@ ained by it then , and now was repeatedly p@@ ained by her petty cares .
but he saw that this was necessary to her , and , loving her , though he could not understand what it was all about , and laughed at her worries , he could not help admir@@ ing them .
it struck him as very charming , but strange , and he thought it would have been better without all that .
she looked forward joy@@ fully to Dol@@ ly 's coming with the children , especially because she meant to give each of them their favourite p@@ ud@@ dings , and because Dol@@ ly would appreciate her new arrangements .
instinc@@ tively feeling the approach of spring , and knowing that there would be wet weather , she built her nest as she could , ha@@ st@@ ening to build it while yet learning how to do it .
this first quarrel arose because Levin had ridden over to see his new farm and returned half an hour late , having attempted a short cut home and lost his way .
he rode home thinking only of her , of her love and of his happiness , and the nearer he came the warmer grew his ten@@ derness for her .
he tried to kiss her but she pushed him away .
'@@ What 's the matter ? '
'@@ You seem mer@@ ry ... ' she began , wishing to say something calmly st@@ inging .
but directly she opened her mouth , words of repro@@ ach , senseless jealousy , and everything else that had been tor@@ turing her during the half @@@ -@@ @ hour she had sat mo@@ tionless waiting at the window , burst from her .
he understood this by a tor@@ m@@ enting sensation of cle@@ av@@ age which he experienced at that moment .
far an instant he was offended , but immediately knew he could not be offended with her because she was himself .
never again did he feel this so strongly as this first time , and for a long time he could not recover his balance .
his natural feelings prompted him to justify himself and prove that she was in the wrong ; but to prove her in the wrong would mean irrit@@ ating her still more , and widening the breach which was the cause of all the trouble .
to remain under so unjust an accusation was painful , but to justify himself and hurt her would be still worse .
like a man half @@@ -@@ @ asleep and oppressed with pain , he wanted to tear off the aching part and cast it from him , but found on waking that the aching part was - himself .
all he could do was to try to soo@@ the the ache and endure it , and this he did .
having realized that she was in the wrong , though she did not acknowledge it , she became more tender to him , and they enjoyed a new and doubled happiness in their love .
but this did not prevent such colli@@ sions recurring quite frequently , and on very unexpected and trivial provocation .
these colli@@ sions were often caused by each not realizing what was important to the other , and also by the fact that in those early days they were often in low spirits .
however , when both were in good spirits their happiness was doubled - and yet the early days of their married life were very trying .
all that time they were conscious of peculiar strain , as if the chain that bound them were being pulled first one way and then the other .
they both tried in after life to eff@@ ace from their memories all the ugly shameful circumstances of this unhealthy time during which they were rarely in a normal state and rarely themselves .
only in the third month of their married life , after returning from Moscow where they had spent a month , did their life begin to run more smoothly .
they H@@ AD J@@ UST returned FROM M@@ OSC@@ O@@ W arid were glad of the sol@@ itude .
he was in his study and sat at the table writing .
as he sat thinking and writing he was all the while blis@@ s@@ fully conscious of her presence .
he went on with his work with a feeling that the centre of gravity of his attention had shifted , and that he consequently saw the matter differently and with greater clear@@ ness .
formerly this work had been his salvation from life .
he used to feel that without it life would be too dismal , and now he needed it in order that his life should not be too mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ously bright .
having set to work again on his manuscript and read over what he had written , he was glad to find , that the work seemed worth doing .
many of his former thoughts now appeared super@@ flu@@ ous and extreme , but many omis@@ sions became clear to him when he went over the matter af@@ resh .
he was writing a fresh chapter on why agriculture was not profitable in Russia .
while he was writing his thoughts , she was thinking about his un@@ natural attention to young Prince Char@@ sky , who had been very tac@@ tlessly paying court to her on the day before their departure from Moscow .
'@@ Why , he 's jeal@@ ous ! ' she thought . ' Oh dear !
I want it ! well ! ' and she opened her eyes wider , trying thereby to increase the force of her look .
'@@ Yes , they divert all the s@@ ap , they produce a false glam@@ our , ' he mut@@ tered , pa@@ using , and feeling that she was looking at him he turned round smiling .
'@@ Well ? ' he asked with a smile , and rose .
'@@ No@@ thing , I only wanted to make you turn round , ' said she , gaz@@ ing at him and trying to discover whether he was v@@ exed at the interruption .
for me , I mean ... ' he said , coming toward her with a be@@ aming smile of happiness .
'@@ And what were you thinking about ? '
go and write , don '@@ t let me distract you , ' she said , p@@ uck@@ ering her lips . ' and I must cut out these little holes , you see ! '
taking up her sc@@ iss@@ ors she began cutting .
'@@ Come , tell me what it was , ' he said , sitting down beside her and watching the circular movement of her tiny sc@@ iss@@ ors .
'@@ Oh , what was I thinking about ?
about Moscow , and about the n@@ ape of your neck . '
'@@ Why should such happiness come just to me ?
it is too beautiful ! ' he said , kis@@ sing her hand .
'@@ To me the more beautiful it is the more natural it seems . '
'@@ Your hair comes to a point behind , ' he said , carefully turning her head round . ' a point ?
yes , you see ! there !
but enough ! we are engaged on serious matters ! '
but their serious matters did not get on , and they jumped apart guil@@ tily when Kuz@@ ma came to say that tea was served .
'@@ And have they returned from town ? ' Levin inqui@@ red of Kuz@@ ma .
'@@ They 've just come and are un@@ packing . '
'@@ Be quick and come , ' she said as she left the study , ' or else I shall read all the letters without you .
'@@ It is not right to live so , ' he thought . ' soon it will be three months since I did anything worth mentioning .
this is almost the first day that I have really set to work seriously and what has come of it ?
even my usual duties - all almost abandoned !
the farm work - why , I hardly even go and see about that !
sometimes I am sorry to part from her , sometimes I can see she is dull .
no , this can '@@ t go on .
I ought to have been fir@@ mer and upheld my independence as a man .
this way I shall get into bad habits and teach them to her too ...
but it is difficult for a dissatisfied man not to repro@@ ach some one else , namely , the person most closely connected with the subject of his dissatisfaction .
she takes no interest in our work , in the farm , in the peasants , or in music , though she is quite good at that , or in books .
'@@ You see , your lady has made me sit with her , ' said Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na , gl@@ ancing with a friendly smile at Kit@@ ty .
in these words of Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na 's Levin read the conclusion of the drama which had lately been enacted between Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na and Kit@@ ty .
he perceived that despite Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na 's grief at the advent of the new mistress who had taken the re@@ ins of management into her own hands , Kit@@ ty had conquered and had made the old woman love her .
I 've read your letter , ' said Kit@@ ty , handing him a badly @@@ -@@ @ written letter . ' it is from that woman , I think - your brother 's ...
fancy !
this time she wrote differently : she had found Nicholas Dmit@@ rich , had joined him in Moscow , and had gone with him to a provincial town where he had obtained a post in the Civil Service .
'@@ Read it ... Dol@@ ly writes about you , ' Kit@@ ty began with a smile , but paused suddenly , noticing the changed expression on her husband 's face .
'@@ What 's the matter ?
Kit@@ ty 's look changed at once .
thoughts of T@@ anya as a mar@@ qu@@ ise and of Dol@@ ly had quite vanished .
'@@ When are you going ? ' she asked .
'@@ i shall go too , may I ? '
what do you mean ? ' he said repro@@ ach@@ fully .
'@@ What , indeed ? ' she replied , offended that he seemed opposed to and v@@ exed at her offer . ' why should I not go ?
'@@ i am going because my brother is dying , ' said Levin , ' but why should you ... ? '
for the same reason as you . '
'@@ at such an important time , she thinks only of how dull it will be for her alone here , ' he thought ; and this motive in connection with something so important v@@ exed him .
'@@ It is impossible , ' he replied ster@@ nly .
Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na , seeing that a quarrel was imminent , softly put down her cup and went out .
the tone in which her husband had said these words hurt her , especially as he evidently dis@@ believed what she had said .
'@@ And I say that if you go I shall go with you . I will certainly go ! ' she said hastily and an@@ gr@@ ily .
'@@ Because it means going goodness knows where , and by what roads ! to what in@@ ns !
you would be in my way , ' said Levin , endeav@@ ouring to keep cool .
'@@ Not at all !
I Sh@@ an '@@ t want anything , and where you can go I can . '
'@@ Well , if only because that woman is there , with whom you C@@ AN@@ NOT associate ... '
'@@ i don '@@ t know and don '@@ t want to know anything about who and what is there .
I know that my husband 's brother is dying , that my husband is going to him , and that I am going with my husband in order ... '
'@@ Kit@@ ty , don '@@ t be angry !
but just think , this matter is so important - it hurts me to think that you are mixing up with it your weakness , your dislike of remaining alone .
well , if you feel dull alone - well , go to Moscow ! '
'@@ There , you see ! you always attribute bad and v@@ ile motives to me , ' she began , with tears of anger and resentment .
'@@ no , this is awful ... being a sort of slave ! ' exclaimed Levin , unable to restrain his anno@@ y@@ ance any longer , but immediately conscious that he had dealt a blow to himself .
'@@ Then why did you marry ?
you might have been free !
why , since you are rep@@ enting ? ' she said , and jumped up and ran into the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room .
when he came in after her , she was so@@ b@@ bing .
he began speaking , trying to find words not so much to dissu@@ ade as to paci@@ fy her .
but she did not listen and did not agree to anything he said .
he sto@@ op@@ ed and took her resisting hand ; he kis@@ sed her hand , her hair , and again her hand , but she remained silent .
but when he took her face in his hands and said ' Kit@@ ty ! ' she suddenly recovered , cried a little , and then they made it up .
the single fact that his wife , his Kit@@ ty , would be in the same room with a girl off the streets made him sh@@ ud@@ der with re@@ pulsion and horror .
'@@ Go , go ! ' she said with a tim@@ id , guilty look at him .
he went out silently , and at the very door came upon Mary Nikol@@ av@@ na , who had heard of his arrival but had not dared to enter .
she was just the same as he had seen her in Moscow - the same stuff dress without collar or cu@@ ffs , and the same kindly , dull , po@@ ck @@@ -@@ @ marked face , only somewhat st@@ outer .
what is it ? '
'@@ Very bad !
he ... you ... are with your wife ? '
for a moment he did not understand the cause of her confusion , but she immediately explained it .
'@@ i will go ... I will go to the kitchen , ' she brought out .
Levin understood that she referred to his wife , and did not know what to say .
'@@ Come along , come ! ' he said .
but he had hardly moved when the door opened and Kit@@ ty looked out .
Levin bl@@ ushed with shame and v@@ ex@@ ation at his wife for having placed herself and him in this awkward position ; but Mary Nikol@@ av@@ na bl@@ ushed still more .
she sh@@ rank together , fl@@ ushed till tears filled her eyes , and seizing the ends of her sha@@ w@@ l began twist@@ ing them in her red fingers , not knowing what to say or do .
at the first glance Levin saw an expression of eager curiosity in the look with which Kit@@ ty gaz@@ ed at this incomprehensible and terrible woman , but it lasted only an instant .
'@@ Well , how is he ?
how is he ? ' she said , addressing first her husband and then the woman .
he had not expected what he saw and felt when he reached his brother 's side .
he had expected to find him in that state of self @@@ -@@ @ deception which , he had heard , was frequent in consu@@ mp@@ tive cases and which had so struck him at the time of his brother 's visit to him in the autumn .
he had expected to find the physical signs of approaching death more definite : greater weakness , greater em@@ aci@@ ation , but still the same sort of condition generally .
Levin could see the mo@@ ist thin hair on the temples and the drawn transparent @@@ -@@ @ looking forehead .
'@@ Im@@ possible that this terrible body can be my brother Nicholas , ' he thought .
the glit@@ tering eyes glanced severely and repro@@ ach@@ fully at the brother who was entering , and this glance immediately established living relations between living people .
Levin at once felt the repro@@ ach in the look fixed on him , and a sense of repentance because of his own happiness .
when Constan@@ tine took him by the hand , Nicholas smiled .
the smile was very faint , hardly percep@@ tible , and in spite of it the stern expression of the eyes did not change .
'@@ You did not expect to find me like this ? ' he said , speaking with difficulty .
'@@ Yes ... no ... ' said Levin , confusing his words . ' how is it you did not let me know sooner , I mean at the time of my marriage ?
he was imp@@ elled to speak in order not to remain silent , but did not know what to say , especially as his brother made no reply but only gaz@@ ed fix@@ edly at him , evidently trying to fa@@ th@@ om the meaning of every word .
Nicholas seemed pleased at this , but said he was afraid the condition he was in might fri@@ ghten her .
a silence followed .
suddenly Nicholas moved and began to talk .
from his expression Levin expected him to say something specially significant and important , but Nicholas only talked about his health .
taking advantage of the first moment of silence , Levin got up , wishing to free himself if only for a few minutes from his painful sensations , and said he would fetch his wife .
'@@ all right , and I will have the place cleaned up a bit .
ti@@ dy up , ' said the invalid with an effort . ' and when you have finished , go away , ' he added , with a questioning look at his brother .
he went out and stopped in the corridor .
Kit@@ ty asked with a frightened look .
'@@ Oh , it 's awful ! awful !
Kit@@ ty was silent a moment , looking tim@@ idly and p@@ iti@@ fully at her husband , then she approached and took hold of his el@@ bow with both hands .
'@@ Ko@@ st@@ ya , take me to him ! it will be easier for us to bear it together !
just take me there and then go away , ' she began . ' try and realize that for me to see you and not to see him is much more painful .
there I can perhaps be of use to him and you .
please let me ! ' she entre@@ ated as if her happiness depended on it .
he was obliged to yield , and having recovered , and quite forgotten Mary Nikol@@ av@@ na , he returned with Kit@@ ty to his brother .
stepping lightly and gl@@ ancing repeatedly at her husband , showing him a brave face full of sympathy she entered the sick @@@ -@@ @ room , and , turning without ha@@ ste , nois@@ el@@ essly closed the door .
'@@ It was in So@@ den we met , but we were not acquainted , ' she said . ' you little thought I should one day be your sister ? '
'@@ You would not have known me again ? ' he asked , with a smile that had lit up his face at her entrance .
what a good thing it is that you did send us word !
not a day passed without Ko@@ st@@ ya 's thinking and being anxious about you . '
she had not finished speaking before that stern repro@@ ach@@ ful look of jealousy , felt by the dying for the living , settled on his face .
Levin CO@@ UL@@ D NOT LO@@ OK AT H@@ IS brother calmly and could not be either natural or tran@@ qui@@ l in his presence .
when he entered the sick@@ room his eyes and his attention became clou@@ ded without his being conscious of it , and he did not see or distinguish the various details of his brother 's condition .
a cold sh@@ ud@@ der cre@@ pt down his back when he began to think of those details .
this made Levin 's position still harder .
he went out continually on all sorts of pret@@ ex@@ ts , coming back and going out again , incapable of remaining alone .
at her command things were brought in and taken out of the sick @@@ -@@ @ room .
she herself went several times to their own room and , without paying any attention to the people she met , brought back with her sheets , pillow @@@ -@@ @ cases , towels , and shirts .
Levin dis@@ approved of all this , not believing that any good could come of it to the invalid .
above all he was afraid that his brother might get angry about it .
but the sick man , though apparently indifferent to it all , was not angry but only ashamed , and on the whole appeared rather interested in what she was doing for him .
Kit@@ ty , having hur@@ ri@@ edly shut the door behind Levin , was not looking that way ; but the invalid mo@@ an@@ ed and she came toward him .
'@@ Don '@@ t come here , ' mut@@ tered the sick man an@@ gr@@ ily . ' I can myself ... '
'@@ What do you say ? ' asked Mary Nikol@@ av@@ na .
but Kit@@ ty had heard , and understood that he felt embarrassed and uncomfortable at being stripped in her presence .
'@@ i 'm not looking , ' she said , helping the arm in . ' Mary Nikol@@ av@@ na , you go round to the other side and put it right , ' she added .
when Levin returned with the bottle he found the invalid arranged in bed and everything around him quite altered .
on another table by the bed@@ side were a glass of some refreshing drink and some pow@@ ders .
the new doctor took out a ste@@ th@@ oscope and sounded him , shook his head , prescribed some medicine and gave extremely precise instructions about giving the medicine and about diet .
he ordered raw or very lightly boiled eggs , and Sel@@ t@@ zer water with new milk at a certain temperature .
he asked ' K@@ ate , ' as he called her , to come nearer .
'@@ i feel much better , ' he said . ' had I been with you I should have recovered long ago .
how pleasant ! ' he took her hand and drew it toward his lips , but as if fearful that this might be dis@@ agre@@ eable to her he changed his mind , let her hand drop , and merely stro@@ ked it .
'@@ Now turn me over on the left side and go to bed , ' he mur@@ mu@@ red .
no one heard what he said , but Kit@@ ty understood him .
can you ? ' she said , addressing Mary Nikol@@ av@@ na .
'@@ i am afraid to , ' answered Mary Nikol@@ av@@ na .
the patient retained his brother 's hand in his .
Levin felt that he wished to do something with his hand and was pulling at it , and yielded with a sinking heart .
yes , his brother drew the hand to his lips and kis@@ sed it .
Levin , trembling , cho@@ king with so@@ bs and unable to utter a word , left the room .
'@@ TH@@ O@@ U hast H@@ ID TH@@ E@@ SE TH@@ IN@@ GS from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto bab@@ es , ' thought Levin while talking with his wife that night .
he knew too that many great and vir@@ ile minds , whose thoughts on that subject he had read , had pon@@ dered it , and yet did not know a hundre@@ d@@ th part of what his wife and Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na knew on the subject .
different as were those two women , Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na and Kit@@ ty - or ' K@@ ate ' as Nicholas called her , and as Levin was also fond of calling her now - in that respect they were exactly alike .
the proof that they knew surely what death was , lay in the fact that they knew without a minute 's hesitation how to behave with the dying and did not fear them .
but Levin and others , though they were able to say a great deal about death , evidently did not know anything , for they feared it and had no notion what to do when people were dying .
had Levin now been alone with his brother Nicholas , he would have looked at him with horror , and would have waited about in still greater horror not knowing what to do next .
more than that , he did not know what to say , how to look , or how to step .
'@@ i fear that if I look at him he will think I am watching . if I don '@@ t look , he will imagine I am thinking of something else .
she talked to him about herself and about her wedding , smiled , sympath@@ ized , ca@@ ressed him , mentioned cases of recovery , and it was all successful , so she evidently knew what she was about .
when Levin returned to their two rooms for the night he sat with hanging head not knowing what to do .
not only could he not think of sup@@ per , of getting ready for the night , of considering what they were to do , he could not even talk to his wife : he was ashamed to .
Kit@@ ty , on the contrary , was more active than usual and even more animated .
she ordered sup@@ per to be brought , un@@ packed their things herself , helped to make the beds and did not forget to sprink@@ le insect powder on them .
it seemed to Levin that it would be in@@ exc@@ usable to eat , sleep , or even to talk , and he felt that his every movement was improper .
she , however , sorted comb@@ s and br@@ ushes , and did it all in such a way that there was nothing offensive about it .
however , they could not eat anything , nor sleep for a long time , and even did not go to bed till very late .
'@@ Do you really think he can recover ? ' he asked , looking at the back of her round little head , at the narrow par@@ ting which closed every time she drew the comb forward .
'@@ i asked the doctor . he says he can '@@ t live more than three days .
but how can they know ?
luckily I learnt a good deal in So@@ den . '
'@@ Can there have been such sick people there ? '
'@@ It is so terrible to me that I C@@ AN@@ NOT help seeing him as he was when young ...
you would not believe what a charming l@@ ad he was , and I did not understand him then . '
I feel that we should have been friends , he and I ... ' she said , and , frightened at her own words , she glanced at her husband , and tears filled her eyes .
'@@ Yes , would have been , ' he said sadly . ' he is really one of those of whom it is said , they are not for this world . '
'@@ However , we have hard days before us - let us go to bed , ' said Kit@@ ty with a glance at her tiny watch .
next DA@@ Y THE patient REC@@ E@@ IV@@ ED communion and Extrem@@ e Un@@ ction .
during the ceremony he prayed ferv@@ ently .
in his large eyes , fixed upon an icon which had been placed on a little table covered with a coloured cloth , was a look of such passionate ent@@ reat@@ y and hope that Levin was frightened at seeing it .
he knew that this passionate ent@@ reat@@ y and hope would only make the par@@ ting from the life he so loved more difficult .
Levin knew too that Kit@@ ty had strengthened that hope by tales of extraordinary recover@@ ies of which she had heard .
during the sac@@ ram@@ ent Levin did that which , ag@@ nostic though he was , he had done a thousand times before .
he said , addressing himself to God , ' If Th@@ ou d@@ ost exist , heal this man ( such things have often happened ) , and Th@@ ou wil@@ t save both him and me ! '
after receiving Extrem@@ e Un@@ ction the invalid suddenly felt better .
he even sat up when they brought him some soup , and asked for a cut@@ let too .
'@@ Better - Yes , much better . - Won@@ der@@ ful ! - It is not at all wonderful . still , he 's better ! ' they said in whis@@ pers , smiling at one another .
the invalid fell quietly asleep , but aw@@ oke half an hour later with a fit of c@@ ough@@ ing , and immediately every hope fled from those around him and from himself .
the reality of his sufferings destroyed it , leaving no trace nor even any recoll@@ ection of the former hopes , in Levin , Kit@@ ty , or the patient himself .
not referring to what he had believed half an hour previously , as though he were ashamed to remember it , Nicholas told them to give him a bottle of iodine covered with per@@ for@@ ated paper for inhal@@ ing .
Levin handed it to him , and at once the look of passionate hope with which the invalid had received Extrem@@ e Un@@ ction was fixed on his brother , demanding from him a confirmation of the doctor 's words to the effect that inhal@@ ing iodine worked miracles .
'@@ Kit@@ ty is not here ? ' he asked ho@@ ar@@ sely , gl@@ ancing round when Levin had reluctantly confirmed the doctor 's statement .
'@@ no ? then I can tell you ...
it 's for her sake I went through that comedy - she is such a dear !
'@@ He is dying ! ' she whispered . ' I 'm afraid he 'll die immediately . '
he was sitting up with his long back bent , leaning his el@@ b@@ ows on the bed and hanging his head .
'@@ What do you feel ? ' asked Levin in a whis@@ per , after a pause .
'@@ i feel I am departing , ' uttered Nicholas with an effort , but very distinctly , as if he were pressing the words out of his body .
he did not lift his head but only turned up his eyes , failing to reach his brother 's face . ' K@@ ate , go away , ' he added .
'@@ De@@ par@@ ting ! ' Nicholas repeated .
'@@ Why do you think that ? ' asked Levin , in order to say something .
'@@ Because I am departing , ' he repeated , as if that word pleased him . ' it 's the end . '
'@@ You had better lie down , you would feel easier , ' she said .
'@@ i 'll soon be lying , ' he said softly . ' dead ! ' he added cyn@@ ically and an@@ gr@@ ily . ' well , lay me down if you like . '
Levin laid his brother on his back , sat down beside him , and holding his breath gaz@@ ed at his face .
the dying man lay with closed eyes , but at intervals the muscles of his forehead worked as if he were thinking deeply and int@@ ently .
for a long , a very long , time as it seemed to Levin the invalid lay mo@@ tionless , but he still lived and at long intervals sigh@@ ed .
Levin was already wear@@ ied by the mental strain .
he felt that despite all his mental efforts he could not understand what was ' so ' and was already lagging far behind his dying brother .
and strange to say he felt quite cold , and experienced neither joy nor grief nor a sense of loss , still less of pity , for his brother .
if he had any feeling left for him it was more like envy of that knowledge which the dying man now possessed and which he might not share .
but the end did not come .
the door opened and Kit@@ ty appeared .
Levin rose to stop her , but at that moment he heard the dying man move .
'@@ Don '@@ t go , ' said Nicholas and stretched out his hand .
Levin gave him his hand , signing an@@ gr@@ ily with the other to his wife .
he now no longer thought about death at all .
he was wondering what Kit@@ ty was doing , who lived in the next room , and whether the doctor had a house of his own .
he wished to eat and sleep .
carefully dis@@ engaging his hand he felt his brother 's feet .
they were cold , but he was still breathing .
Levin gently dis@@ engaged his hand , and without looking at his brother went to his own room and fell asleep .
when he woke , instead of the news he expected , that his brother was dead , he heard that his former condition had returned .
no one , neither his brother nor Kit@@ ty , could comfort him .
he was angry with every one , said dis@@ agre@@ eable things , blamed everybody for his sufferings , and demanded that they should fetch a celebrated doctor from Moscow .
to all questions of how he felt , he gave the same answer , with an angry and repro@@ ach@@ ful look : ' I am suffering terribly , intoler@@ ably ! '
Kit@@ ty tried to help him and comfort him in every possible way , but it was all in vain , and Levin saw that she herself was worn out physically and mentally , though she would not admit it .
that consciousness of death which had been ev@@ oked in them all by his farewell to life on the night he had sent for his brother was destroyed .
it was all a lie : a re@@ pul@@ sive , insul@@ ting , bl@@ asph@@ em@@ ous lie ; and as a result of his character , and because he loved the dying man more than the others did , Levin felt that lie most painfully .
Levin , who had long wished to reconcile his brothers , even if only at the moment of death , had written to Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich , and having received his answer read it to Nicholas .
Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich wrote that he could not come personally , but , in touching words , asked his brother 's pardon .
the invalid made no comment .
'@@ What am I to write to him ? ' asked Levin . ' I hope you are not angry with him ? '
'@@ no , not at all , ' answered Nicholas , v@@ exed at the question . ' tell him to send me a doctor . '
another three days of torture went by . the sick man was still in the same condition .
only the invalid himself did not show that desire , but on the contrary was angry because the doctor had not been fetched , and he continued taking medicine and talking of life .
his sufferings , regularly increasing , did their work of preparing him for death .
there was no position that did not cause him pain ; no moments of for@@ get@@ fulness ; no part of his body that did not hurt and tor@@ ment him .
even the memories , impressions , and thoughts , within his body now aroused in him the same sort of re@@ pulsion as the body itself .
the sight of other persons , their words , his own recoll@@ ections , gave him nothing but pain .
those about him felt this , and unconsciously did not permit themselves either to move freely , talk or express their own wishes in his presence .
his life was quite swallowed up in a consciousness of suffering and a desire to be released from it .
it was clear the change was taking place within him which would bring him to regard death as a fulfilment of his desires , as happiness .
formerly every separate desire caused by suffering or priv@@ ation , such as hunger or thirst , was relieved by some bodily action which brought enjoyment ; but now priv@@ ation and suffering were not followed by relief , but the attempt to obtain relief occa@@ sioned fresh suffering .
therefore all his desires were merged into one : a desire to be released from all this pain and from its source - his body .
he had no words to express his desire for this liberation , and therefore did not speak of it ; but went on from habit demanding satisfaction of those wishes that could be fulfilled .
'@@ Turn me on the other side , ' he said , and immediately afterwards asked to be put back as he had been .
tell me something !
why don '@@ t you speak ? '
then as soon as they began to talk he shut his eyes and expressed wear@@ iness , indifference , and dis@@ gust .
on the tenth day after their arrival in that town Kit@@ ty fell ill .
she had a headache , was sick , and could not leave her bed all the morning .
the doctor explained her illness as the result of fatigue and agitation , and ordered mental tranqu@@ ill@@ ity .
after dinner , however , Kit@@ ty got up and went as usual to the sick man , taking her embroi@@ dery .
Nicholas looked at her ster@@ nly when she entered , and smiled cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ously when she said she had been ill .
that day he continually blew his nose and mo@@ an@@ ed pit@@ e@@ ously .
'@@ How do you feel ? ' she asked him .
'@@ Wor@@ se , ' he answered with an effort . ' it hurts ! '
'@@ Where does it hurt ' ?
'@@ Every@@ where . '
'@@ To @@@ -@@ @ day it will end , you 'll see , ' said Mary Nikol@@ av@@ na in a whis@@ per , but so that the invalid , whose senses were very acute , was , as Levin saw , sure to hear her .
Nicholas had heard , but the words had no effect on him ; his look remained repro@@ ach@@ ful and strained .
'@@ He has begun to cl@@ utch at himself , ' replied Mary Nikol@@ av@@ na .
'@@ Cl@@ utch ? how ? '
'@@ Like this , ' she said , pulling at the fol@@ ds of her stuff dress .
and Levin noticed that all day long the sick man really kept catching at himself as if wishing to pull something off .
Mary Nikol@@ av@@ na 's prophecy was fulfilled .
toward night the patient could no longer raise his hands , and only gaz@@ ed straight before him without changing the attentive concentrated expression of his eyes .
even when his brother or Kit@@ ty bent over him so that he could see them , he did not look at them .
Kit@@ ty sent for the priest to read the prayers for the dying .
while the priest read , the dying man showed no sign of life : his eyes were closed .
Levin , Kit@@ ty , and Mary Nikol@@ av@@ na stood by the bed@@ side .
the prayers were not yet ended when the dying man stretched himself ; sigh@@ ed and opened his eyes .
having finished the prayer , the priest touched the cold forehead with his cross which he then wrapped in his stole , and after standing in silence another two minutes , touched the enormous bloo@@ dless hand , which was growing cold .
'@@ He has passed away , ' said the priest and turned to go ; but suddenly the clam@@ my mou@@ st@@ ache of the dying man moved and from the depth of his chest through the sti@@ ll@@ ness came his voice , sharp and distinct :
the sight of his brother and the proximity of death renewed in Levin 's soul that feeling of horror at the in@@ scrut@@ ability , near@@ ness , and inev@@ itability of death which had seized him on that autumn evening when his brother had arrived in the country .
he felt that love had saved him from despair , and that that love under the men@@ ace of despair grew still stronger and pu@@ rer .
scarcely had the un@@ explained mystery of death been enacted before his eyes when another mystery just as in@@ expl@@ icable presented itself , calling to love and life .
her illness was pregnancy .
only after Anna had left his house , and the English govern@@ ess sent to ask him whether she was to dine with him or alone , did he for the first time clearly understand his position , and he was horror @@@ -@@ @ struck at it .
what was most painful in his situation was his inability to reconcile his past life with the present state of things .
it was not the past when he lived happily with his wife that perpl@@ exed him , the transition from that past to the consciousness of his wife 's in@@ fidelity he had already painfully passed through ; that had been trying , but it was comprehensible .
the first two days after his wife 's departure K@@ aren@@ in received peti@@ tion@@ ers , and his private secretary , attended Committee Meetings , and went to the dining @@@ -@@ @ room to dinner as usual .
without rendering account to himself why he did it , during those two days he tried with all his might to appear calm and even indifferent .
'@@ Exc@@ use me , your Excell@@ ency , for taking the liberty of troubling you !
K@@ aren@@ in appeared to be considering , when suddenly he turned round and sat down at the table .
dropping his head on his hands he sat thus for a long time , tried several times to speak , but stopped short .
compreh@@ ending his master 's emotion , Kor@@ ney asked the assistant to come again another time .
K@@ aren@@ in , left alone , realized that he could not any longer maintain an appearance of firm@@ ness and calm .
he felt that he could not bear the general pressure of contempt and harsh@@ ness which he had clearly seen in the faces of that shop @@@ -@@ @ assistant and of Kor@@ ney , and of every one without exception whom he had met during those two days .
he felt that people would destroy him , as dogs kill a tortured dog that is wh@@ ining with pain .
he knew that the only way of escape from men was to hide his wounds from them . he had unconsciously tried to do so for two days , and now felt himself unable to continue the unequal struggle .
his despair was heightened by the consciousness that he was quite alone in his sorrow .
K@@ aren@@ in had been left an orph@@ an .
they could not remember their father , and their mother died when Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich was ten years old .
they had small means .
their uncle , K@@ aren@@ in , a high official and at one time a favourite with the late Emperor , brought them up .
neither at school nor at the university , nor afterwards , in the Service , did he enter into friendly relations with anyone .
his brother was nearest to his heart , but he served under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and always lived abroad , where he died soon after Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich 's marriage .
K@@ aren@@ in hes@@ itated long .
he proposed , and devoted to his bet@@ ro@@ thed and to his wife all the feeling of which he was capable .
his attachment to Anna excluded from his soul any need he had felt for aff@@ ection@@ ate relations with other persons ; and now , among all his acquaintances , he had no intimate friend .
he was connected with many people , but had friendly relations with none .
there was a fellow @@@ -@@ @ student at the university with whom he had subsequently become friendly , and to whom he might have spoken of his grief ; but that fellow @@@ -@@ @ student was now curator in a distant educational district .
of the Petersburg people the most intimate and most likely were the doctor , and Michael Vas@@ il@@ ich S@@ ly@@ ud@@ in , his private secretary .
once K@@ aren@@ in , having finished signing documents , remained silent a long time , gl@@ ancing now and then at Michael Vas@@ il@@ ich , and tried several times but was unable to begin speaking .
the other person , the doctor , was also well @@@ -@@ @ inclined toward K@@ aren@@ in , but they had long ago come to a tacit understanding that they were both overwhelmed with work and had no time to spare .
of his women friends , including the principal one among them , the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna , K@@ aren@@ in did not think at all .
all women , as such , appeared to him dreadful and re@@ pul@@ sive .
K@@ aren@@ in H@@ AD forgotten THE Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna , but she had not forgotten him .
at that most painful time of lonely despair she came to his house and entered his study un@@ announced .
she found him in the posture in which he had long sat , resting his head on his hands .
'@@ J '@@ ai forc@@ é la con@@ sig@@ ne ! [ ' I 've forced my way in . ' ] she said as she entered with hur@@ ried steps , breathing heavily from her rapid movement and from excitement .
Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich , my dear friend ! ' she continued , firmly cl@@ as@@ ping his hand in both hers and gaz@@ ing with her beautiful dream@@ y eyes into his .
K@@ aren@@ in rose fro@@ w@@ ning , and dis@@ engaging his hand moved a chair toward her .
'@@ If you please , Countess ! - I do not receive because I am ill , ' he said , and his lips trem@@ bled .
he was moved , and seizing her pl@@ ump hand began kis@@ sing it .
'@@ My dear friend ! ' she repeated in a voice broken by emotion , ' you must not give way to sorrow .
your sorrow is great , but you will find consolation . '
'@@ You will find support ; do not seek it in me , though I want you to believe in my friendship , ' she replied with a sigh . ' love is the only support , that love which He has be@@ que@@ athed us !
his y@@ oke is easy , ' she went on with that ec@@ static look he knew so well . ' he will support you and help you ! '
'@@ i am weak - I am done for !
I did not foresee it and don '@@ t understand it now ! '
'@@ My dear friend ! ' Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna said once more .
'@@ It is not the loss of what no longer exists , it is not that , ' continued K@@ aren@@ in .
'@@ i don '@@ t regret that , but I C@@ AN@@ NOT help feeling ashamed before others of the position I am in .
K@@ aren@@ in fro@@ w@@ ned , and bending his hands backward began cracking his fingers .
'@@ One must know all the details , ' he said in a high @@@ -@@ @ pit@@ ched voice . ' human strength has its limits , Countess , and I have reached the limits of mine .
all day long I have had to take domestic decisions resulting from ' ( he emphasized the word ' resulting ' ) ' my new solitary position .
the servants , the govern@@ ess , the bills ...
these petty flames have burnt me , and I was unable to bear it .
I could not bear the way my son looked at me .
he did not ask me the meaning of it all , but he wanted to ask , and I could not endure his look .
he was afraid of looking at me . but this is not all ... '
K@@ aren@@ in was going to mention the bill that had been brought him , but his voice shook and he paused .
he could not think of that bill , made out on blue paper for a bon@@ net and rib@@ bons , without pit@@ ying himself .
'@@ i understand , dear friend , ' said the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ova .
'@@ i understand it all . not in me will you find help and consolation , though I have come to help you if I can .
if I could take all those trivial humiliating cares off your shoulders ? ...
I see that a woman 's word , a woman 's direction , is wanted .
K@@ aren@@ in silently and grat@@ efully pressed her hand .
'@@ We will look after Ser@@ ez@@ ha together .
I am not good in practical matters , still I will undertake it - I will be your house@@ keeper .
do not thank me .
I am not doing it of myself ... '
'@@ i C@@ AN@@ NOT help than@@ king you . '
'@@ But , my dear friend , do not give way to that feeling you were speaking about - of being ashamed of that which is the utmost height of Christianity !
in Him alone you will find peace , comfort , salvation , and love ! ' and raising her eyes to Heaven she began to pray , as K@@ aren@@ in understood from her silence .
K@@ aren@@ in listened to her now , and those very expressions , which formerly had seemed to him if not dis@@ agre@@ eable at least super@@ flu@@ ous , now seemed natural and comfor@@ ting .
he did not like that new ec@@ static influence .
he was a believer , interested in religion chiefly from a political point of view , and this new teaching which allowed itself some novel interpretation , just because it paved the way for disputes and analyses , was repu@@ gn@@ ant to him on principle .
he had formerly regarded the new teaching with col@@ dness and even hostility , and had never discussed it with the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna ( who was carried away by it ) , but had carefully and silently ev@@ aded her challenges .
now for the first time he listened to her words with pleasure and without mental re@@ join@@ der .
'@@ i am very , very grateful to you , both for your actions and your words , ' said he when she had finished praying .
'@@ Now I am going to act , ' she said , smiling and wi@@ ping the traces of tears from her face . ' I am going to see Ser@@ ez@@ ha .
only in extreme cases will I apply to you , ' and she rose and went out .
the Countess went to Ser@@ ez@@ ha 's part of the house and there , wat@@ ering the frightened boy 's cheeks with her tears , told him that his father was a saint and that his mother was dead .
she really took upon herself the care of arranging and managing K@@ aren@@ in 's household , but she had not exaggerated when she said she was not good at practical matters .
for K@@ aren@@ in it was easy to accept that interpretation .
the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna when quite a young and ec@@ static girl was married to a rich , arist@@ ocratic , very good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured , and most jo@@ vial prof@@ lig@@ ate .
the Countess Ly@@ dia had long ago ceased to be in love with her husband , but since then had never ceased to be in love with somebody else .
she was in love with several persons at once , both men and women ; she had been in love with almost every one who was specially notable .
she was in love with all the new Prin@@ ces and Princ@@ esses who became connected with the Imperial family , she was in love with a Metropolitan , a Su@@ ff@@ r@@ agan , and a priest .
all these passions , ever wa@@ xing or wan@@ ing , did not interfere with her carrying on very widespread and complicated relations with the Court and Society .
the feeling she now had for him seemed to her stronger than any of her former sentiments .
she was not only glad to meet him , but searched his face for signs of the impression she created on him .
she wished to please him not merely by words , but by her whole self .
for his sake she now paid more attention to her dress than ever before .
she caught herself med@@ itating on what might have been had she not married and had he been free .
she bl@@ ushed with excitement when he entered the room , and could not re@@ press a smile of delight when he said something agre@@ eable to her .
for some days the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna had been greatly excited .
a young ad@@ j@@ ut@@ ant , a com@@ rade of V@@ ron@@ sky 's , through whom she had her information , who hoped through her influence to obtain a concession , told her that they had finished their affairs and were leaving Petersburg next day .
Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna was beginning to breathe freely again , when next morning she received a note and with horror recognized the hand@@ writing .
it was Anna K@@ aren@@ ina 's .
the envelope was as thick as par@@ chment ; there was a large mon@@ ogram on the narrow yellow sheet , and the letter had a delicious perf@@ ume .
it was some time before the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna could sit down to read the letter .
her agitation brought on a fit of asthma , to which she was subject .
when she grew cal@@ mer , she read the following , written in French :
'@@ M@@ AD@@ AN@@ IE LA Com@@ tes@@ se ! - The Christian feelings which fill your heart encourage me to what I feel to be the un@@ par@@ don@@ able bold@@ ness of writing to you .
I am unhappy at being parted from my son .
I entre@@ at you to permit me to see him once before my departure .
forgive me for reminding you of myself .
I address myself to you , instead of to Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich , only because I do not wish to give pain to that high @@@ -@@ @ minded man by reminding him of myself .
will you send Ser@@ ez@@ ha to me , or shall I come to the house at an appointed time , or will you let me know when and where I can meet him away from home ?
you C@@ AN@@ NOT imagine the yearning I have to see him , and therefore C@@ AN@@ NOT imagine the gratitude which your help will awaken in me . -
everything in that letter irrit@@ ated the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna : its matter , the hint contained in the word ' mag@@ n@@ anim@@ ity , ' and especially what seemed to her its free and easy tone .
'@@ S@@ ay there will be no answer , ' said the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna , and at once opened her blo@@ t@@ ter and wrote to K@@ aren@@ in that she hoped to meet him about one o 'clock at the Palace , at the Bir@@ th@@ day Rec@@ eption .
'@@ i must talk over an important and sad matter with you , and we can arrange where .
best of all at my house , where I will have your special tea ready .
he sends a cross , but He also sends strength to bear it , ' she added , to prepare him somewhat .
the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna generally wrote two or three notes a day to K@@ aren@@ in .
she liked that way of communicating with him , which had an elegance and secrecy absent in their personal interviews .
meeting as they were going out , acquaintances chat@@ ted about the latest news , the newly awarded hon@@ ours , and the changes among the highest officials .
'@@ What were you saying about K@@ aren@@ in ? ' inqui@@ red the Prince .
'@@ i thought he had it already . '
'@@ no , he has aged , ' said the cham@@ ber@@ lain .
he is always writing projects now .
he will not release that unfortunate fellow until he has exp@@ ounded everything , point by point . '
please don '@@ t say anything bad about the Countess . '
'@@ And is it true that his wife is here ? '
'@@ of course not here in the Palace , but she is in Petersburg .
I met her and Alex@@ is V@@ ron@@ sky walking arm in arm on the Mor@@ skaya . '
almost at the same time that his wife had left K@@ aren@@ in , the most painful thing that can be@@ fall an official - the cessation of his ascent in the Service - had be@@ fallen him .
that cessation was an accomplished fact , clearly visible to every one , though K@@ aren@@ in himself had not yet realized that his career was at an end .
he still held an important post , was member of many Com@@ missions and Committees , but he was finished , and from him nothing further was to be looked for .
whatever he might say , whatever he might propose , he was listened to as if all he was proposing had long been known and was what no one wanted .
soon after the par@@ ting with his wife he began writing a pam@@ ph@@ let on the new legal procedure , the first of an innumerable series of unwanted pam@@ ph@@ lets on every administrative department which it was his fate to write .
but K@@ aren@@ in , far from noticing the hopel@@ essness of his position in offici@@ al@@ dom and being troubled by it , was more satisfied with his work than ever .
he thought that since he had been without a wife he had served the Lord by means of these very projects more than before .
the evident impati@@ ence of the Member of the Council did not trouble K@@ aren@@ in , who left off exp@@ ounding his project only when the Coun@@ cill@@ or , prof@@ iting by a royal person@@ age 's passing , slipped away .
left alone , K@@ aren@@ in bowed his head , collecting his thoughts ; and then turned absent @@@ -@@ @ min@@ dedly toward the door where he hoped to meet the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna .
moving his feet deliberately , K@@ aren@@ in , with his usual air of wear@@ iness and dignity , bowed to those gentlemen who were talking about him , and his eyes searched through the doorway for the Countess .
'@@ Than@@ k you , ' replied K@@ aren@@ in . ' what a beautiful day it is , ' he added , laying , as was his won@@ t , peculiar stress on the word ' beautiful . '
he knew that they were laughing at him , but he no longer looked for anything except hostility from them ; he was already accustomed to it .
Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna 's dress had cost her a great deal of trouble , as was the case with all her at@@ tire of late .
her purpose in dressing was now quite the reverse of what she had had in view thirty years ago .
as far as K@@ aren@@ in was concerned she attained her object , and to him she seemed attractive .
in his eyes she was the only is@@ let , not of kindly feeling only but of affection , in the ocean of hostility and ri@@ dic@@ ule which surrounded him .
as he now ran the g@@ aun@@ t@@ let of those mo@@ cking eyes he was drawn toward her enam@@ oured look as naturally as a plant is drawn toward the sun .
'@@ i congratulate you , ' she said , indicating the ribbon by a look .
re@@ pressing a smile of pleasure , he shrugged his shoulders and closed his eyes , as if to say that it could not give him pleasure .
the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna knew very well that it was one of his greatest pleasures , though he would never confess it .
'@@ How is our angel ? ' asked she , meaning Ser@@ ez@@ ha .
'@@ i can '@@ t say I am quite satisfied with him , ' replied K@@ aren@@ in , raising his eyebrows and opening his eyes . ' and Sit@@ nikov too is dissatisfied with him . '
Sit@@ nikov was the tutor to whom Ser@@ ez@@ ha 's secular education was entrusted .
when with Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna 's help he had returned to life and activity , he had felt it his duty to take his son 's education in hand .
never having occupied himself with educational matters before , he devoted some time to studying the matter theoretically .
after reading several books on anthropol@@ ogy , ped@@ ag@@ og@@ ics , and D@@ id@@ ac@@ tics , he formed a plan of education , and having engaged the best Petersburg educ@@ ation@@ alist for supervision , he set to work .
and this undertaking occupied him continually .
I see in him his father 's heart , and with such a heart a child can '@@ t be bad ! ' said Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna , enthusi@@ astically .
well , as far as I am concerned I do my duty , which is all I can do . '
'@@ Will you come and see me ? ' said the Countess after a pause . ' we must talk over something painful to you .
I would have given anything to save you from certain memories , but other people think differently .
I had a letter from her .
she is here in Petersburg . '
K@@ aren@@ in started at the reference to his wife , but immediately his face assumed a death @@@ -@@ @ like im@@ mobility which showed utter hel@@ pl@@ essness in the matter .
when K@@ aren@@ in entered the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna 's sn@@ u@@ g little bou@@ do@@ ir , which was full of old china and had its walls covered with portraits ; the host@@ ess was not yet there .
upon a round table covered with a cloth stood a Chinese tea service and a silver kettle over a spirit lamp .
K@@ aren@@ in glanced absent @@@ -@@ @ min@@ dedly at the num@@ ber@@ less familiar portraits decor@@ ating the bou@@ do@@ ir , and sitting down by the table opened a New Testament that was on it .
'@@ Well , now we can sit down quietly , ' said she with an ag@@ itated smile , as she squeezed herself in between the table and sofa , ' and have a chat over our tea . '
after a few words of preparation the Countess , breathing heavily and bl@@ ushing , handed him the letter she had received .
'@@ i don '@@ t consider that I have a right to refuse , ' he said tim@@ idly , raising his eyes .
'@@ My dear friend , you see no evil in anyone ! '
his face expressed uncertainty and a desire for advice , support , and guidance in a matter he did not understand .
'@@ no , ' she interrupted him , ' there are limits to everything !
I understand im@@ morality , ' she said , not quite sincerely , for she never could have understood that which leads women to im@@ morality , ' but I do not understand cruelty ... and to whom ? to you !
how can she stay in the town you are in ?
but it 's quite true , " Live and learn " !
and I am learning to understand your lo@@ ft@@ iness and her bas@@ eness . '
'@@ But is it love , dear friend ?
is it sincere ?
granted that you have forgiven her , and do forgive her ; but have we the right to act thus toward the soul of that angel ?
he thinks she is dead .
he pra@@ ys for her and asks God to forgive her her sins , and it is better so .
but this ... what will he think ? '
'@@ i had not thought of that , ' said K@@ aren@@ in , evidently agreeing with her .
the Countess covered her face with her hands and remained silent .
she was praying .
'@@ If you ask my advice , ' she said , when her prayer was ended and she uncovered her face , ' I do not advise you to do it !
do I not see how you are suffering , how this has re@@ opened all your wounds !
of course as usual you are not thinking of yourself .
but what can it lead to ?
renewed pain for yourself , and pain for the child !
if there is anything human left in her , she herself should not desire it .
no , I advise you un@@ hes@@ it@@ at@@ ingly not to allow it , and with your permission I will write to her . '
K@@ aren@@ in agreed , and the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna wrote in French as follows :
this letter achieved the secret purpose which the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna hid even from herself .
it wounded Anna to the depths of her soul .
K@@ aren@@ in too , on returning home from Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna 's , could not give his attention to his usual occupations nor find that spiritual peace of a believer who has found salvation , which he had felt before .
the memory of the letter he had written to her also tor@@ m@@ ented him ; above all his forgiveness , which no one wanted , and his care for another man 's child , burned his heart with shame and regret .
he now felt a similar sense of shame and remor@@ se when thinking of his whole past with her , and recalling the awkward words in which , after much hesitation , he had proposed to her .
and there rose before his mind 's eye a whole row of those vigorous , strong , self @@@ -@@ @ assured men , who had always involun@@ tarily attracted his curiosity and attention .
he drove these thoughts from him , and tried to convince himself that he was not living for the present temporal life but for eternal life , and that his soul was full of peace and love .
but the fact that in this temporary insignificant life he had committed , as it seemed to him , some trivial errors , tor@@ m@@ ented him as much as if the eternal salvation in which he believed did not exist .
'@@ Ser@@ ez@@ ha ! ' said his tutor , a S@@ lav , stopping in the doorway that led to the inner rooms , ' take it off yourself . '
but Ser@@ ez@@ ha , though he heard his tutor 's weak voice , paid no heed to it .
he stood holding on by the porter 's shoulder @@@ -@@ @ str@@ ap and looking into his face .
the hall @@@ -@@ @ porter nodded affirm@@ atively .
the band@@ aged official , who had called seven times to petition K@@ aren@@ in about something , interested both Ser@@ ez@@ ha and the hall @@@ -@@ @ porter .
Ser@@ ez@@ ha had met him in the hall , and had heard him pit@@ e@@ ously begging the porter to announce him to K@@ aren@@ in , and saying that he and his children were face to face with death .
since then , having again met the official in the hall , Ser@@ ez@@ ha had become interested in him .
'@@ And was he very glad ? ' he asked .
'@@ And has anything been brought ? ' inqui@@ red Ser@@ ez@@ ha , after a pause .
'@@ Well , sir , ' said the porter , shaking his head and whis@@ pering , ' there is something from the Countess . '
Ser@@ ez@@ ha knew at once that the hall @@@ -@@ @ porter was speaking of a birthday present for him from the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna .
'@@ You don '@@ t say so ?
'@@ Kor@@ ney has taken it in to your Pap@@ a .
'@@ What size ?
'a book ? '
'@@ Vasily Luk@@ ich , one moment ! ' said Ser@@ ez@@ ha with that bright and aff@@ ection@@ ate smile which always over@@ came the conscienti@@ ous Vasily Luk@@ ich .
this joy appeared to him particularly important because it coincided with the satisfaction of the official , and his own happiness that a present had been brought .
to Ser@@ ez@@ ha it seemed that this day was one on which everybody ought to be happy and gay .
'@@ And your daughter , has she been here lately ? '
'@@ How can she come on week @@@ -@@ @ days ?
they have to learn too , and so must you , sir ! go along ! '
on entering the school@@ room , instead of sitting down to his lessons , Ser@@ ez@@ ha told his tutor of his guess that the parcel that had been brought must be a railway train . ' what do you think ? ' he asked .
but Vasily Luk@@ ich only thought that Ser@@ ez@@ ha must prepare his grammar lesson , as his teacher was coming at two .
'@@ Oh , but just tell me , Vasily Luk@@ ich ! ' said Ser@@ ez@@ ha , suddenly , after sitting down at the table with a book in his hand . ' what is higher than the Alexander Nevsky ?
Vasily Luk@@ ich replied that the Order of Vladimir was higher .
'@@ And higher still ? '
'@@ the highest is the St Andrew . '
'@@ And higher still ? '
'@@ Even you don '@@ t know ! ' and Ser@@ ez@@ ha , leaning his el@@ b@@ ows on the table , began to reflect .
his reflections were most complex and varied .
as soon as it was invented he would gain it .
in these reflections time passed until the teacher arrived . the lesson on the attributes of Time , Place , and Man@@ ner of Action had not been learnt .
he chose a moment when the teacher was looking silently into the book :
'@@ Michael Ivanovich , when is your birthday ? ' he suddenly asked .
'@@ You would do better to think of your work . birth@@ days do not signi@@ fy anything to reasonable beings .
it is just a day like any other , on which we must work . '
he was aware that the teacher himself did not believe what he was saying ; he felt that by the tone in which the words were uttered .
'@@ But why have they all agreed to speak in the same way about the dul@@ lest and most useless things ?
why does he re@@ pulse me ? why does he not love me ? ' he asked himself sadly , and could find no answer .
before his father came Ser@@ ez@@ ha sat at the table playing with a pocket @@@ -@@ @ knife and thinking .
among his favourite occupations was keeping a look out for his mother when he went out walking .
he imagined that every well @@@ -@@ @ developed and graceful woman with dark hair was his mother .
at the sight of any such woman a feeling of such ten@@ derness aw@@ oke in his heart that he grew breath@@ less and tears came to his eyes .
he expected that at any moment she would approach and lift her veil .
the lady did not come up to them and disappeared somewhere .
Vasily Luk@@ ich r@@ oused him . ' your Pap@@ a is coming ! '
Ser@@ ez@@ ha jumped up , approached his father , kis@@ sed his hand , and looked at him attentively , trying to find some sign of his joy at receiving the Order of Alexander Nevsky .
'@@ Have you had a nice walk ? ' asked K@@ aren@@ in , as he sat down in his arm @@@ -@@ @ chair , drew toward him an Old Testament and opened it .
although K@@ aren@@ in had more than once told Ser@@ ez@@ ha that every Christian ought to be well acquainted with Bible history , he often in Old Testament history had to consult the book , and Ser@@ ez@@ ha noticed this .
'@@ Yes , Pap@@ a , it was very am@@ using , ' answered Ser@@ ez@@ ha , sitting down side@@ ways on his chair and beginning to rock it , which was forbidden . ' I met Nad@@ enka ' ( Nad@@ enka was Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna 's ni@@ ece , who was being educated at her aunt 's house ) .
'@@ First of all , don '@@ t rock your chair , ' said K@@ aren@@ in . ' secondly , it 's not the reward but the work that is precious .
it was the same long @@@ -@@ @ familiar tone in which his father always addressed him , and to which Ser@@ ez@@ ha had already learnt to adapt himself .
'@@ You understand me , I hope , ' said the father .
'@@ Yes , Pap@@ a , ' answered the boy , pretending to be that imaginary boy .
the lesson consisted in learning by heart some verses from the Gos@@ p@@ els and repeating the beginning of the Old Testament .
it was evident to K@@ aren@@ in that the boy did not understand what he was saying , and this irrit@@ ated him .
he fro@@ w@@ ned and began an explanation that Ser@@ ez@@ ha had heard many times already and could never remember because he understood it too clearly , just as he could not remember that the word suddenly was an attribute of the manner of action .
Ser@@ ez@@ ha looked at his father with scared eyes , and could only think of whether his father would make him repeat what he had just said , as he sometimes did .
this thought frightened him so much that he no longer understood anything at all .
Ser@@ ez@@ ha related the events themselves quite well , but when he had to answer questions as to what some of the events symbol@@ ized , he knew nothing about it , though he had been punished before for not knowing this lesson .
the part , however , about which he could not say anything at all but only fl@@ oun@@ dered , cut the table , and roc@@ ked his chair , was that about the ant@@ ed@@ il@@ u@@ vian patri@@ archs .
he did not know any of them except E@@ no@@ ch , who was taken up to Heaven alive .
he did not in the least believe in death , which was so often mentioned to him .
he did not believe that people he loved could die , nor above all that he himself would die .
that seemed to him quite impossible and incomprehensible .
but he was told that everybody would die ; he had even asked people whom he trusted and they all confirmed it ; his nurse too said so , though reluctantly .
but E@@ no@@ ch had not died , so not everybody died , ' and why should not anybody deserve the same in God 's sight , and be taken up to Heaven alive ? ' thought Ser@@ ez@@ ha .
bad people , that is to say those he did not like , might die ; but the good ones might all be like E@@ no@@ ch .
'@@ Well , who were the patri@@ archs ? '
'@@ But you have already mentioned them .
this is bad , Ser@@ ez@@ ha , very bad !
if you do not take pains to know what is most necessary for a Christian , then what can interest you ?
I am dis@@ pleased with you , and Peter Ig@@ nat@@ ych ' - this was the chief educ@@ ation@@ alist - ' is also dis@@ pleased with you ...
his father and the educ@@ ation@@ alist were both dis@@ pleased with Ser@@ ez@@ ha , and he really learnt badly .
yet it could not at all be said that he was an incapable boy .
on the contrary he was far more capable than the boys whom the educ@@ ation@@ alist set before him as models .
his father from his point of view considered that the boy did not try to learn what he was being taught .
as a matter of fact , he could not learn it .
he could not , because there were more urgent demands on his soul than those put forward by his father and the educ@@ ation@@ alist .
the two kinds of demands were opposed , and he was in direct conflict with his instructors .
his instructors complained that he would not learn , yet his soul was over@@ flowing with longing for knowledge .
so he learnt , from Kap@@ it@@ on@@ ich , from his nurse , from Nad@@ enka , and from Vasily Luk@@ ich , but not from his teachers .
the water which his fathers and the educ@@ ation@@ alists expected would turn their mill @@@ -@@ @ wheels had long since le@@ aked out and was working somewhere else .
his father punished Ser@@ ez@@ ha by not letting him go to see Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna 's ni@@ ece Nad@@ enka , but this punishment turned out luckily for Ser@@ ez@@ ha .
Vasily Luk@@ ich was in good spirits and showed him how to make wind@@ mills .
'@@ Vasily Luk@@ ich ! do you know for what I have been praying extra ? '
'@@ To learn better ? '
when it comes true , I will tell you .
'@@ no , I can '@@ t guess .
you 'd better tell me , ' said Vasily Luk@@ ich , smiling , which he rarely did . ' well , lie down , and I 'll put out the candle . '
'@@ But I can see better without a candle what I have been praying for !
there , I nearly told you the secret ! ' said Ser@@ ez@@ ha with a mer@@ ry laugh .
when the candle had been taken away he heard and felt his mother .
she stood above him and ca@@ ressed him with a loving look .
but then wind@@ mills appeared , and a knife , and all became confused , and he fell asleep .
when V@@ ron@@ sky AND AN@@ NA reached PE@@ TER@@ SB@@ UR@@ G they put up at one of the best hotels : V@@ ron@@ sky separately on the first floor , and Anna with the baby , the nurse , and a maid , up@@ stairs in a large suite consisting of four rooms .
on the day they arrived V@@ ron@@ sky went to see his brother .
there he met his mother , who had come from Moscow on business .
his mother and his sister @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law received him just as usual , asked him about his trip abroad and spoke of mutual acquaintances , but did not say a single word about his union with Anna .
despite all his experience of the world , V@@ ron@@ sky , in the new position in which he found himself , was making a terrible mistake .
'@@ of course they will not receive her at Court , but intimate friends can and should see things the right way , ' he thought .
this was what V@@ ron@@ sky experienced with regard to Society .
though in the depths of his soul he knew that Society was closed to them , he tried whether it would not change and whether it would not receive them .
but he very soon noticed that though the great world was open to him personally , it was closed to Anna .
one of the first Petersburg Society ladies he met was his cousin Bet@@ sy .
where are you staying ?
I can imagine how dreadful our Petersburg must appear to you after your delightful journey ; I can picture to myself your honeymoon in Rome .
is it all arranged ? '
he noticed that Bet@@ sy 's delight cooled down when she learnt that Anna had not yet been divorced .
'@@ They will throw stones at me , I know , ' she said , ' but I shall come and see Anna . yes , I will certainly come .
you are not staying here long ? '
and really she came to see Anna that same day ; but her manner was very different from what it had formerly been .
she was evidently proud of her bold@@ ness and wished Anna to appreciate the fidelity of her friendship .
she did not stay more than ten minutes , ch@@ attering Society gossip , and as she was leaving said :
of course I have kicked over the traces , but others , straight @@@ -@@ @ lac@@ ed people , will give you the cold shoulder until you get married .
and it is so simple nowadays !
from Bet@@ sy 's tone V@@ ron@@ sky might have realized what he had to expect from Society , but he made another attempt with his relations .
of his mother he had no hopes .
he knew that his mother , who had been so delighted with Anna when she first made her acquaintance , was now merc@@ il@@ ess toward her for having caused the ruin of her son 's career .
but he placed great hopes on Var@@ ya , his brother 's wife .
she , he thought , would cast no stones , but would simply and resolutely go and see Anna and receive her at her own house .
the day after his arrival V@@ ron@@ sky called on her , and having found her alone , expressed his wish .
'@@ Please don '@@ t think I am condemning you . not at all !
perhaps in her place I should have done the same . I do not and C@@ AN@@ NOT enter into details , ' she added , looking tim@@ idly into his gloomy face .
'@@ But we must call things by their real names . you wish me to go and see her and to receive her , and so rehabilit@@ ate her in Society ; but please understand that I C@@ AN@@ NOT do it !
I have daughters growing up , and I must move in Society , for my husband 's sake .
'@@ Alex@@ is , don '@@ t be angry with me !
please understand that it is not my fault , ' said Var@@ ya , looking at him with a tim@@ id smile .
'@@ i am not angry with you , ' he said just as glo@@ om@@ ily , ' but I am dou@@ bly p@@ ained .
I am p@@ ained too because this breaks our friendship .
no , not breaks it , but weakens it .
you understand that for me too there can be no other course ' . '
with those words he left her .
one of the most dis@@ agre@@ eable features of his position in Petersburg was that K@@ aren@@ in seemed to be everywhere and his name in every mouth .
it was impossible to start any conversation without its turning upon K@@ aren@@ in , impossible to go anywhere without meeting him .
so at least it seemed to V@@ ron@@ sky , as a man with a sore finger feels that he is continually knocking that finger against everything as if on purpose .
the stay in Petersburg seemed to him still more trying because he noticed all the time in Anna a new and to him incomprehensible mood .
at one moment she appeared to be in love with him , and at the next would turn cold , irrit@@ able , and im@@ penetr@@ able .
one OF AN@@ NA 'S reasons FOR returning TO RUS@@ SIA was to see her son .
from the day she left Italy the thought of that meeting did not cease to ag@@ itate her .
the nearer they came to Petersburg the greater its joy and importance appeared .
she did not ask herself how she should cont@@ ri@@ ve it .
the thought of her son did not leave her for an instant , but she had not yet seen him .
she felt she had not the right to go straight to the house where she might encounter K@@ aren@@ in .
possibly they might even not admit her .
it was painful to her even to think of writing to and coming into contact with her husband : she could be calm only when she did not think of him .
Ser@@ ez@@ ha 's old nurse might have helped and advised her , but she was no longer in K@@ aren@@ in 's household .
she knew that if that letter were shown to him he , continuing his mag@@ n@@ anim@@ ous role , would not refuse her request .
the commission@@ aire who delivered her letter brought back the most cruel and unexpected reply : that there would be no answer !
Anna felt herself humiliated and wounded , but she saw that the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna was right from her own point of view .
her grief was the more po@@ ignant because she had to bear it alone .
she could not share it with V@@ ron@@ sky and did not wish to .
she knew that , though he was the chief cause of her misery , the question of her seeing her son would seem to him quite un@@ important .
she knew he would never be able to appreciate the depth of her angu@@ ish , and that his col@@ dness if the matter were mentioned would make her hate him .
and she feared that , more than anything else in the world , and therefore hid from him everything concerning her son .
having spent all that day at the hotel considering how she might see her son , she resolved to write to her husband .
she had already composed the letter when she received Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna 's reply .
'@@ That col@@ dness , that pret@@ ence of feeling ! ' she said to herself . ' they want to wound me and torture the child , and shall I submit to them ?
she would go early in the morning , at about eight , when K@@ aren@@ in would certainly not be up .
the only thing she did not prepare was what she would say to her son .
much as she thought about that she could not prepare the words .
next morning Anna went alone , and at eight o 'clock got out of the hired carriage and rang the bell at the front door of the house which used to be her home .
it 's some lady , ' said Kap@@ it@@ on@@ ich , who was not yet dressed , and in over@@ coat and gol@@ os@@ hes pe@@ ep@@ ed from the window at the veiled lady standing close to the door .
his assistant , a l@@ ad whom Anna did not know , had hardly opened the door when she entered , and taking a three @@@ -@@ @ rouble note from her mu@@ ff hastily thrust it into his hand .
Sergey Alex@@ ey@@ ich ! ' she said , and walked on .
after examining the note the porter 's assistant stopped her at the inner glass door .
noticing the stranger 's confusion , Kap@@ it@@ on@@ ich himself came out , admitted her , and inqui@@ red what she wanted .
'@@ i come from Prince Sk@@ or@@ od@@ um@@ ov to see Sergey Alex@@ ey@@ ich , ' said she .
'@@ He is not up yet , ' said the hall @@@ -@@ @ porter , carefully scrutin@@ izing her face .
Anna had not foreseen at all that the totally un@@ altered appearance of the hall of the house where she had lived for nine years would so deeply affect her .
one memory after another , both joyful and painful , rose in her mind , and for a moment she forgot why she had come .
'@@ W@@ ould you like to wait ? ' said Kap@@ it@@ on@@ ich , helping her off with her cloak .
having done so he glanced again at her face and , recognizing her , silently bowed low .
'@@ Come in , Your Excell@@ ency , ' he said .
she wished to speak , but her voice refused to utter a sound ; with a look of guilty ent@@ reat@@ y at the old man she went with light steps up the stairs .
bending forward and catching the steps with his gol@@ os@@ hes , Kap@@ it@@ on@@ ich ran after her , trying to over@@ take her .
'@@ the tutor may be there and not yet dressed .
Anna continued to asc@@ end the familiar steps without understanding what the old man was saying .
'@@ Let me in , let me in ! ' she cried , and entered at the big door .
to the right of the door stood a bed on which sat the boy , his night@@ shirt un@@ but@@ t@@ oned , bending his little body backward , stretching himself and finishing his y@@ awn .
at the moment when his lips were closing they extended into a blis@@ s@@ ful sleep@@ y smile , and with that smile he again fell slowly and swe@@ etly backwards .
'@@ Ser@@ ez@@ ha ! ' she whispered , drawing nearer with in@@ audi@@ ble steps .
during the time they had been parted and under the influence of that g@@ ush of love which she had felt for him of late she had always imagined him as a little fellow of four , the age when she had loved him best .
now he was not even as she had left him ; he was still further removed from the four @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old child ; he had grown still more and had got thinner .
how long his arms !
how changed since she had left him !
but still it was he : the slope of the head was his , the lips were his , the soft neck and the broad shoulders .
'@@ Ser@@ ez@@ ha ! ' she repeated , just above the child 's ear .
he raised himself again on his el@@ bow , moved his t@@ ous@@ led head from side to side as if seeking for something , and opened his eyes .
'@@ Ser@@ ez@@ ha , my dear little boy ! ' she uttered , catching her breath and embracing his pl@@ ump little body .
'@@ M@@ ama ! ' he mut@@ tered , w@@ ri@@ ggling about in her arms so as to touch them with different parts of his body .
'@@ i knew ! ' he said , opening his eyes . ' to @@@ -@@ @ day is my birthday .
I knew you would come !
while saying this he was again falling asleep .
Anna watched him with greedy eyes . she noticed how he had grown and changed during her absence .
she touched it all , and could not speak : tears were cho@@ king her .
'@@ What are you crying about , M@@ ama ? ' he asked , now quite awake . ' M@@ ama , what are you crying about ? ' he exclaimed in a f@@ ret@@ ful voice .
'@@ How do you dress without me ?
how do you ... ' She tried to speak simply and cheer@@ fully , but could not , and turned away again .
'@@ i don '@@ t wash with cold water . Pap@@ a says I mu@@ st@@ n '@@ t .
you have not seen Vasily Luk@@ ich ?
and you are sitting on my clothes ! '
'@@ Well , and what did you think about me ?
you did not think I was dead ? '
'@@ You did@@ n '@@ t believe it , my dar@@ ling ? '
'@@ i knew ! I knew ! ' he cried , repeating his favourite phrase , and seizing her hand , which was ca@@ ressing his hair , he pressed her palm to his mouth , covering it with kis@@ ses .
but the ca@@ resses of the mother and son , the sound of their voices and what they were saying , made him change his mind .
he shook his head , sigh@@ ed , and closed the door again .
'@@ i will be another ten minutes , ' he said to himself , c@@ ough@@ ing and wi@@ ping away his tears .
meanwhile among the servants there was great com@@ motion .
Kor@@ ney , the val@@ et , went down into the hall @@@ -@@ @ porter 's room to inqu@@ ire who had let her in , and hearing that it was Kap@@ it@@ on@@ ich who had done so , he re@@ pri@@ man@@ ded the old man .
the hall @@@ -@@ @ porter remained obst@@ in@@ ately silent ; but when the val@@ et said he ' ought to get the sack , ' Kap@@ it@@ on@@ ich rushed at Kor@@ ney and , flourishing his hands about before Kor@@ ney 's face , began to speak out :
'@@ Yes , I da@@ res@@ ay you would not have let her in !
I 've been in service here ten years , and have had nothing but kindness : you had better go up and tell her , " You be off , please ! "
you 're an art@@ ful one , you are !
you 'd better look after yourself and how to fle@@ ece the master of fur coats ! '
when the nurse entered , Ser@@ ez@@ ha was just telling his mother how he and Nad@@ enka fell down together when ice @@@ -@@ @ h@@ illing , and turned three som@@ ers@@ aults .
she was listening to the sound of his voice , saw his face and the play of his features , felt his hands , but did not understand what he was saying .
she must go away , must leave him - that was all she thought and felt .
she heard Vasily Luk@@ ich 's step as he came to the door and c@@ ough@@ ed , and then the steps of the nurse as she entered ; but she sat as if turned to stone , powerless to speak or rise .
'@@ Mad@@ am , dear ! ' the nurse began , coming up to Anna and kis@@ sing her hands and shoulders . ' what joy God has sent our little one on his birthday !
and you have not changed at all . '
suddenly the nurse burst into tears and again began to kiss Anna 's hand .
Ser@@ ez@@ ha , with bright eyes and be@@ aming smile , holding his mother with one hand and his nurse with the other , jumped with his pl@@ ump bare feet on to the carpet .
the ten@@ derness of his beloved nurse for his mother sent him into rap@@ tures .
she could not say good @@@ -@@ @ bye , but the expression of her face said it and he understood . ' dar@@ ling , dar@@ ling K@@ uti@@ k ! ' she said , calling him by the pet name she used when he was quite little , ' you won '@@ t forget me ?
you ... ' but she could say no more .
how many things she thought of later that she might have said !
but now she did not know what to say and could not speak .
but Ser@@ ez@@ ha understood all she wanted to tell him .
he understood that she was unhappy and that she loved him .
he had even understood what the nurse had said in a whis@@ per .
he had caught the words ' always before nine o 'clock , ' and he understood that they referred to his father and that his mother and father must not meet .
this he had grasped , but he could not make out why that look of fear and shame appeared on her face ...
she could not have done wrong , and yet seemed afraid and ashamed of something .
he wanted to ask a question which would clear up his doubts , but dared not ; he saw that she suffered and he was sorry for her .
he pressed against her in silence , and then whispered :
'@@ Ser@@ ez@@ ha , my dar@@ ling ! ' she said , ' love him ! he is better and kin@@ der than I , and I am to blame toward him .
'@@ There is nobody better than you ! ... ' he cried out in desperation through his tears , and seizing her by her shoulders he hu@@ gged her with all his might , his arms trembling with the effort .
'@@ Dar@@ ling little one ! ' said Anna , and began to cry in the same weak and child@@ like way as he .
at that moment the door opened and Vasily Luk@@ ich entered .
Ser@@ ez@@ ha sank down on his bed and began to so@@ b , hiding his face in his hands .
Anna moved the hands away , kis@@ sed him again on his wet face , and went rapidly out .
K@@ aren@@ in was advancing toward her .
when he saw her , he stopped and bowed his head .
she swiftly let down her veil and with quick@@ ened steps almost ran out of the room .
she had not had time even to un@@ wrap the toys she had chosen with so much love and sadness the day before , and she took them back with her .
on returning to her lonely suite in the hotel she could not for a long time understand why she was there .
'@@ Yes , it is all ended and I am alone again , ' she said to herself ; and without taking off her bon@@ net she sat down in an easy @@@ -@@ @ chair by the fireplace .
with her eyes fixed on a bronze clock , standing on a table between the windows , she began pon@@ dering .
the French maid , whom she had brought from abroad , came and asked whether she would not dress .
'@@ L@@ ater , ' she said .
the Italian nurse , having smar@@ tened up the baby girl , came in and held her out to Anna .
everything about this baby was sweet , but for some reason she did not grip the heart .
and from him she was for ever s@@ under@@ ed , not only physically but spiritually , and there was no remedy for it .
she returned the baby to its nurse , sent them away , and opened a loc@@ ket with Ser@@ ez@@ ha 's portrait as a baby about the same age as the little girl .
rising , she removed her bon@@ net and took from the table an album in which were photographs of her son at different ages .
she wanted to compare these lik@@ en@@ esses and began drawing them out of the album .
she took them all out but one , the last and best of the photographs .
he was there in a white shirt , ast@@ ride a chair , his brows fro@@ w@@ ning while his mouth smiled .
this was his most characteristic and best expression .
'@@ Yes , there he is ! ' she said with a glance at V@@ ron@@ sky 's lik@@ eness , and suddenly remembered that he was the cause of her present grief .
she had not called him to mind all that morning ; but now , having caught sight of that man@@ ly , noble face , so familiar and dear to her , she felt an unexpected flow of love toward him .
how can he leave me alone in my angu@@ ish ? ' she suddenly thought with a sense of repro@@ ach , forgetting that she herself had hidden from him all that concerned her son .
the servant returned with the reply that he had a visitor , but would come up at once , and wished to know whether he might bring with him Prince Y@@ ash@@ vin , who had just arrived in Petersburg .
and suddenly a strange idea crossed her mind : what if he had ceased to love her ?
'@@ But he must tell me .
I must know it !
if I know it , then I know what I shall do , ' she told herself , powerless to imagine the position she would find herself in when she was convinced of his indifference .
she imagined that he had ceased to love her , and she was almost in despair : which r@@ oused in her a feeling of peculiar excitement .
she heard the bell before she was ready .
when she entered the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room not his eyes but Y@@ ash@@ vin 's met hers .
V@@ ron@@ sky was examining her son 's photos , which she had forgotten on the table , and did not hurry to look at her .
let me have them , ' she added , with a rapid movement taking from V@@ ron@@ sky the photos he was looking at , and gl@@ ancing at him impres@@ sively with g@@ listening eyes . ' were the races good this year ?
I saw the races on the Cor@@ so in Rome instead !
but of course you don '@@ t care for life abroad , ' she went on with a pleasant smile : ' I know you and know all your tastes , though we have met so seldom . '
'@@ i am very sorry to hear it , for my tastes are mostly bad , ' said Y@@ ash@@ vin , b@@ iting the left side of his mou@@ st@@ ache .
after a short talk , noticing that V@@ ron@@ sky looked at the clock , Y@@ ash@@ vin asked her whether she would be staying long in Petersburg , and strai@@ ghtening his immense body picked up his cap .
'@@ Not long , I think , ' she replied with embarrassment gl@@ ancing at V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ Then we shall not meet again ? ' said Y@@ ash@@ vin , rising ; and then turning to V@@ ron@@ sky he asked , ' Where are you dining ? '
of all his regim@@ ental friends Alex@@ is liked you best . '
'@@ i shall be very pleased , ' said Y@@ ash@@ vin , with a smile which showed V@@ ron@@ sky that he liked Anna very much .
Y@@ ash@@ vin bowed and went out . V@@ ron@@ sky remained behind .
'@@ You are going too ? ' she asked .
I shall catch you up in a minute ! ' he shouted to Y@@ ash@@ vin .
she took his hand and looked fix@@ edly at him , trying to think of something to say to prevent his leaving her .
'@@ W@@ ait - I have something to tell you , ' she said , and raising his short hand she pressed it to her neck . ' was it wrong of me to ask him to dinner ? '
'@@ You have done very well , ' he replied , showing his compact row of teeth in a calm smile , and kis@@ sing her hand .
'@@ Alex@@ is , you have not changed toward me ? ' she asked , sque@@ ezing his hand in both hers . ' Alex@@ is , I am in tor@@ ment here !
when are we going ? '
'@@ So@@ on , very soon !
you would hardly believe how trying our life here is to me too , ' he said , drawing away his hand .
'@@ Well , then go ! go ! ' she said in an offended tone , and quickly left him .
when V@@ ron@@ sky returned Anna had not yet come home .
he was told that , soon after he left , a lady came to see her and they went away together .
he decided that it was necessary to have an explanation with her , and he waited for her in the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room .
she it was who had been to see Anna that morning , and they had been shopping together .
Anna seemed not to notice the worried look of inquiry on V@@ ron@@ sky 's face , but ch@@ attered g@@ aily about what she had been buying .
the table was laid for four .
they were all assembled and about to enter the little dining @@@ -@@ @ room , when T@@ ush@@ kevich arrived with a message for Anna from the Princess Bet@@ sy .
the Princess asked to be exc@@ used for not coming to say good @@@ -@@ @ bye ; she was not well , but asked Anna to come and see her between half @@@ -@@ @ past six and nine .
V@@ ron@@ sky glanced at Anna when that definite time was mentioned , which showed that care had been taken to prevent her meeting anyone there ; but Anna did not seem to observe it .
'@@ i 'm sorry that between half @@@ -@@ @ past six and nine is just the time when I C@@ AN@@ NOT come , ' she replied with a faint smile .
'@@ the Princess will be very sorry . '
'@@ And I too . '
'@@ i expect you are going to hear Patt@@ i ? ' asked T@@ ush@@ kevich .
that 's an idea !
I would go if I could get a box . '
'@@ i could get you one , ' said T@@ ush@@ kevich .
'@@ i should be very , very grateful if you would ! ' replied Anna . ' but won '@@ t you stay and dine with us ? '
V@@ ron@@ sky slightly shrugged his shoulders .
he could not in the least understand what Anna was after .
he looked seriously at her , but she answered him with the same provocative glance of high spirits or desperation , the meaning of which he could not make out .
at dinner Anna was aggressively mer@@ ry , seeming to flir@@ t with both T@@ ush@@ kevich and Y@@ ash@@ vin .
after dinner T@@ ush@@ kevich went to get a box and Y@@ ash@@ vin to have a smoke . V@@ ron@@ sky went with Y@@ ash@@ vin down to his own rooms , but after sitting with him a while , ran up@@ stairs again .
'@@ You are really going to the theatre ? ' said he , trying not to look at her .
'@@ Why do you ask in such a frightened way ? ' she said , again offended because he did not look at her . ' why should I not go ? '
'@@ of course there is no reason whatever , ' he replied with a fro@@ wn .
'@@ That 's just what I say , ' she answered , purpos@@ ely ignoring the sar@@ cas@@ m of his tone and calmly pulling up her long perf@@ um@@ ed g@@ love .
'@@ Anna ! for heaven 's sake , what has come to you ? ' he said , trying to recall her to her senses , as her husband once used to do .
'@@ i don '@@ t understand your question . '
'@@ Why ?
" but don '@@ t you know ... ? ' he began .
do I repent of what I have done ? no !
if it had to begin again from the beginning I should do just the same .
for us , for you and me , only one thing is important : whether we love each other .
no other considerations exist .
why do we live here , separated and not seeing one another ?
why don '@@ t you look at me ? '
he saw all the beauty of her face and of her dress , which suited her as her dresses always did .
but now it was just this beauty and elegance that irrit@@ ated him .
'@@ My feelings C@@ AN@@ NOT change , you know that ; but I beg you not to go ! I entre@@ at you ! ' he said , again speaking French with tender ent@@ reat@@ y in his voice but with a cold look in his eyes .
she did not hear his words , but saw the col@@ dness of his look , and replied irrit@@ ably :
'@@ And I beg you will explain why I should not go . '
'@@ Because it might cause you ... ' He became confused .
V@@ ron@@ sky FOR THE FI@@ R@@ ST T@@ IME F@@ EL@@ T v@@ exed and almost angry with Anna for her unwillingness to realize her position .
this feeling was strengthened by the fact that he could not tell her the reason of his v@@ ex@@ ation .
but he could not say this to her .
'@@ But how can she fail to understand it ? and what is happening to her ? ' he asked himself .
he felt that his regard for her had diminished and his consciousness of her beauty increased simultaneously .
he went down fro@@ w@@ ning to his rooms , and taking a seat beside Y@@ ash@@ vin , who sat with his long legs stretched out on a chair drinking brandy and Sel@@ t@@ zer , ordered the same for himself .
'@@ You were talking about Lan@@ kovsky 's Power@@ ful .
he is a good horse , and I advise you to buy him , ' said Y@@ ash@@ vin , gl@@ ancing at his com@@ rade 's gloomy coun@@ tenance . ' it 's true he has a go@@ ose r@@ ump , but his legs and head leave nothing to be desired . '
'@@ i think I 'll take him , ' replied V@@ ron@@ sky .
this conversation about horses interested him , but he never forgot Anna , and involun@@ tarily listened to the steps in the corridor and glanced at the clock on the man@@ tel@@ piece .
Y@@ ash@@ vin emp@@ tied another glass of brandy into the sparkling water , drank it , and then rose , but@@ t@@ oning his coat .
'@@ Well , let us go , ' he said , smiling slightly under cover of his big mou@@ st@@ ache , and showing by that smile that he understood the cause of V@@ ron@@ sky 's depression , but did not attach importance to it .
'@@ i 'm not going , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky dis@@ m@@ ally .
but why not come to the st@@ alls ? take Kras@@ insky 's place , ' Y@@ ash@@ vin added as he went out .
'@@ no , I have something to do . '
'@@ With a wife one has trouble , but with one who is not a wife it 's worse , ' thought Y@@ ash@@ vin as he left the hotel .
left alone , V@@ ron@@ sky got up and began pac@@ ing the room .
'@@ What is on to @@@ -@@ @ day ?
the fourth ab@@ on@@ n@@ ement ...
Alexander will be there with his wife , and probably Mother also .
am I afraid , or have I put her under T@@ ush@@ kevich 's protection ?
why does she put me in such a position ? ' he said with a wave of his arm .
as he made this gesture he struck the little table on which the Sel@@ t@@ zer and a dec@@ an@@ ter of brandy were standing and almost knocked it over .
'@@ If you wish to remain in my service , ' he said to the val@@ et when the latter came in , ' remember your duties .
V@@ ron@@ sky entered the theatre at half @@@ -@@ @ past eight .
the performance was in full swing .
through a door slightly aj@@ ar came the sounds of a mu@@ ff@@ led st@@ acc@@ ato accompan@@ iment by the orchestra and of a female voice rendering a musical phrase with precision .
the door opened to let an attendant slip through , and the nearly completed phrase struck V@@ ron@@ sky 's ears distinctly .
the door was closed immediately and he did not hear the end of the phrase nor the tr@@ ill after it , but knew from the thunder of applause behind the door that the tr@@ ill was finished .
when he entered the aud@@ it@@ orium , brilli@@ antly illuminated by chan@@ deli@@ ers and bronze gas brackets , the noise still continued .
the conductor from his raised seat helped to pass the bou@@ qu@@ ets , and re@@ arranged his white tie .
V@@ ron@@ sky went to the middle of the floor , then stopped and looked around him .
to @@@ -@@ @ day he paid less attention than ever to the familiar surroundings : the stage , the noise , and all that well @@@ -@@ @ known , un@@ interesting , mot@@ ley herd of audience in the packed theatre .
to these o@@ ases V@@ ron@@ sky at once turned his attention and immediately got into touch with them .
V@@ ron@@ sky had not yet seen Anna , he intentionally avoided looking her way ; but from the direction in which people were looking he knew where she was .
he glanced around uno@@ b@@ tru@@ sively , but did not look at her : prepared for the worst , he looked for K@@ aren@@ in .
luckily for him , K@@ aren@@ in was not in the theatre that evening .
'@@ How little of the military man is left in you ! ' remarked Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy . ' you might be a diplom@@ atist , an artist , or anything of that kind . '
'@@ Yes , as soon as I returned home I put on a black coat , ' V@@ ron@@ sky replied with a smile , slowly taking out his opera @@@ -@@ @ glasses .
'@@ Now in that , I confess , I envy you !
I , when I come back from abroad and put this on again , regret my freedom , ' he said , touching his shoulder @@@ -@@ @ knot .
Ser@@ pu@@ kh@@ ov@@ skoy had long ago ceased to trouble himself about V@@ ron@@ sky 's career , but was as fond of him as ever and was particularly am@@ i@@ able to him now .
next to a lady wearing a Tur@@ ban , and a bal@@ d old man who blin@@ ked an@@ gr@@ ily just as V@@ ron@@ sky 's moving glass reached him , he suddenly saw Anna 's proud head , strikingly beautiful , and smiling in its frame of lace .
she was in the fifth box in the lower tier , some twenty p@@ aces from him .
the po@@ ise of her head on her fine broad shoulders , and the gle@@ am of restrained excitement in her eyes and her whole face , reminded him precisely of how he had seen her at the ball in Moscow .
but her beauty affected him very differently now .
there was no longer anything mysterious in his feelings for her , and therefore though her beauty attracted him even more strongly , it also offended him .
she was not looking his way , but he felt that she had already seen him .
Y@@ ash@@ vin 's face wore the expression it had when he was losing at cards .
he was fro@@ w@@ ning and drawing the left side of his mou@@ st@@ ache further and further into his mouth , looking ask@@ ance at the adjoining box .
in that box to the left were the K@@ art@@ as@@ ov@@ s .
V@@ ron@@ sky knew them and knew that Anna had been acquainted with them .
the wife , a thin little woman , was standing up in her box with her back to Anna , putting on an opera @@@ -@@ @ cloak which her husband was holding for her .
her face looked pale and angry and she was speaking exc@@ it@@ edly .
K@@ art@@ asov , a st@@ out bal@@ d @@@ -@@ @ headed man , kept gl@@ ancing round at Anna while trying to paci@@ fy his wife .
when the wife left the box the husband lo@@ it@@ ered behind , trying to catch Anna 's eye and evidently wishing to bow to her .
but Anna , with obvious intention , took no notice of him and , turning round , was saying something to Y@@ ash@@ vin , whose cro@@ pped head was bent toward her .
K@@ art@@ asov went out without b@@ owing and the box remained empty .
V@@ ron@@ sky could not make out what had taken place between the K@@ art@@ as@@ ov@@ s and Anna , but he saw that it was something humiliating for Anna .
he realized that from what he had seen , and especially from Anna 's face , who , he knew , was summon@@ ing her utmost strength to sustain the role she had undertaken .
she fully succeeded in playing that role - of external tranqu@@ ill@@ ity .
knowing that something had happened , but not knowing just what , V@@ ron@@ sky felt painfully ag@@ itated , and , hoping to find out something , set out for his brother 's box .
intentionally leaving the aud@@ it@@ orium at the opposite side to where Anna was , he encountered the Commander of his old regiment , who stood talking to two acquaintances .
V@@ ron@@ sky heard them mention the name of K@@ aren@@ in , and noticed how the Commander ha@@ st@@ ened to call him loudly by name , with a significant glance at the others .
we can '@@ t let you go away without a feast .
you are one of our very own ! ' said the Commander .
'@@ i shall not have time ... I 'm very sorry ! some other time , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , and ran up the stairs to his brother 's box .
in the box was V@@ ron@@ sky 's mother , the old Countess , with her iron @@@ -@@ @ grey cur@@ ls .
Var@@ ya and the Princess Sor@@ ok@@ ina he met in the corridor outside .
having conducted the Princess Sor@@ ok@@ ina back to V@@ ron@@ sky 's mother , Var@@ ya held out her hand to her brother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law and at once began to talk of the matter that interested him .
'@@ You know I shall be the last to hear of it ! '
'@@ is there a creature more ven@@ om@@ ous than that K@@ art@@ as@@ ova ? '
her husband began convers@@ ing with her from his box , and K@@ art@@ as@@ ova flew at him !
it seems she said something insul@@ ting out loud , and then went out . '
'@@ Count , your mam@@ an wants you , ' said the Princess Sor@@ ok@@ ina , looking out of the box door .
'@@ i have been expecting you all the time , ' said his mother with a sar@@ cas@@ tic smile . ' I never see anything of you . '
her son saw that she could not re@@ press a smile of satisfaction .
I was coming to you , ' he replied col@@ dly .
'@@ Mam@@ an ! I asked you not to speak to me about that subject , ' he answered fro@@ w@@ ning .
'@@ i am saying what every one says . '
V@@ ron@@ sky did not reply , and after a few words addressed to the Princess Sor@@ ok@@ ina he left the box .
in the doorway he met his brother .
'@@ ah , Alex@@ is ! ' said his brother . ' what a shame .
I was just going to see her !
V@@ ron@@ sky did not listen to him .
he hur@@ ried down@@ stairs feeling that he must do something , he knew not what .
he was disturbed both by v@@ ex@@ ation with Anna for placing herself and him in this false position , and by pity for her sufferings .
he descended to the st@@ alls and went straight to Anna 's box , in front of which stood St@@ remo@@ v talking to her .
V@@ ron@@ sky bowed to her and stopped to shake hands with St@@ remo@@ v .
'@@ i think you got here late and missed the finest aria , ' said Anna to him , with a mo@@ cking glance as it seemed to him .
'@@ i am a poor judge , ' he replied , looking severely at her .
she rose and went to the back of the box .
Anna had already returned .
when V@@ ron@@ sky entered she was still dressed as she had been at the theatre .
she was sitting in the first arm @@@ -@@ @ chair by the wall , fix@@ edly gaz@@ ing before her .
'@@ It 's all your fault ! your fault ! ' she exclaimed with tears of despair and spite in her voice , and rose .
'@@ But I asked , I entre@@ ated you not to go ! - I knew it would be unpleasant for you ! '
however long I may live I shall never forget it !
she said it was a dis@@ grace to sit near me . '
'@@ the words of a silly woman ; ' he said . ' but why risk it ? why provoke ... '
'@@ i hate your calm@@ ness !
you should not have driven me to it .
if you loved me ... '
is it a question of my love ? ... '
'@@ Yes ! if you loved me as I love you , if you suffered the angu@@ ish I do ... ' she replied with a frightened glance at him .
he was sorry for her and yet v@@ exed with her .
he assured her of his love , because he saw that that alone could paci@@ fy her now , and did not repro@@ ach her with words , though he repro@@ ached her in his heart .
and those assurances of love , which to him appeared so trivial that he felt ashamed to utter them , she drank in and gradually became calm .
next day , fully reconciled , they left for the country .
Dol@@ ly AND H@@ ER CH@@ IL@@ D@@ RE@@ N W@@ ERE SP@@ END@@ ING THE SU@@ MM@@ ER with her sister Kit@@ ty at Pok@@ rovsk .
the house on her own estate was quite dil@@ ap@@ id@@ ated , so Levin and his wife persuaded her to spend the summer with them .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky quite approved of this arrangement .
only one of his relatives , Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich , visited him that summer - and he was a man of the Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev type and not a Levin , so that the Levin spirit was quite overwhelmed .
and Kit@@ ty , who conducted her household with great assi@@ du@@ ity , had no little trouble to proc@@ ure all the chickens , tur@@ keys , and duc@@ ks , of which , with the visitors ' and the children 's summer appe@@ ti@@ tes very many were required .
the whole family was assembled at dinner .
'@@ You must take me too !
I am very fond of looking for mush@@ rooms , ' he said with a glance at V@@ aren@@ ka . ' I consider it a very good occupation . '
'@@ Why , certainly ! we shall be very pleased , ' replied V@@ aren@@ ka with a bl@@ ush .
the intellectual and learned Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev 's offer to go and gather mush@@ rooms with V@@ aren@@ ka confirmed a suspicion that had greatly occupied Kit@@ ty 's mind of late .
she ha@@ st@@ ened to say something to her mother so that her glance should pass unnoticed .
after dinner Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev sat down by the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room window , continuing his conversation with his brother over a cup of coffee and gl@@ ancing now and then at the door through which the children , who were preparing to set out on the mush@@ room hunt , would enter .
Kit@@ ty stood near her husband , evidently waiting for the end of the conversation - which did not interest her - before speaking to him .
'@@ K@@ ate , it is not good for you to be standing , ' said her husband , with a meaning look , moving a chair toward her .
'@@ ah , well ! there 's no time now , ' added Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev as the children came running in .
in advance of them all , at a side@@ ways gal@@ lo@@ p , came T@@ anya in tightly pulled @@@ -@@ @ up stock@@ ings , running toward Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , flourishing a basket and his hat .
'@@ V@@ aren@@ ka is waiting , ' she said , carefully placing his hat on his head when she saw from his smile that she had permission to do so .
V@@ aren@@ ka , who was wearing a yellow print dress and a white ker@@ chief on her head , stood in the doorway .
'@@ i 'm coming , M@@ l@@ le V@@ aren@@ ka , ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , drinking up his coffee and po@@ ck@@ eting his hand@@ ker@@ chief and ci@@ gar@@ case .
'@@ What a dar@@ ling my V@@ aren@@ ka is , eh ? '
Kit@@ ty said to her husband as soon as Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev had risen .
she said it so that the latter could hear , with an evident desire that he should do so . ' and how handsome , how no@@ bly handsome ! ...
V@@ aren@@ ka ! ' she exclaimed . ' you will be in the wood by the mill ?
we will drive there . '
'@@ You quite forget your condition , Kit@@ ty , ' said the old Princess , hur@@ rying in . ' you should not shout so . '
V@@ aren@@ ka , hearing Kit@@ ty 's voice and her mother re@@ pri@@ man@@ ding her , came up with her light step .
the quick@@ ness of V@@ aren@@ ka 's movements , the colour suff@@ using her animated face , all showed that something unusual was taking place within her .
Kit@@ ty knew what that unusual thing was , and watched her attentively .
she had now called V@@ aren@@ ka only to give her a silent blessing for the important event which , according to Kit@@ ty , was to happen in the woods that day after dinner .
'@@ V@@ aren@@ ka , I shall be very happy if a certain thing comes to pass , ' she whispered , kis@@ sing her .
'@@ And are you coming with us ? ' V@@ aren@@ ka , quite confused , asked Levin , pretending not to have heard what had been said to her .
'@@ i must look at the new w@@ agg@@ ons , and count them , ' said Levin . ' and where will you be ? '
they always liked to sit there after dinner but to @@@ -@@ @ day they had special business there .
'@@ Steve says it 's better to give them money , ' Dol@@ ly remarked , returning to the interesting topic of what presents it was best to give to the servants , ' but ... '
'@@ How can one give them money ! ' said the Princess and Kit@@ ty with one voice . ' they value presents so ! '
'@@ Well , I for instance got our Mat@@ ren@@ a Sem@@ en@@ ovna not exactly po@@ pl@@ in , but something of that kind , last year , ' said the Princess .
'@@ Yes , I remember she wore it on your Name day . '
'@@ the pattern is charming - so simple and refined .
I would have had one made like it myself if she had@@ n '@@ t had it .
it is something like V@@ aren@@ ka 's , and so pretty and cheap . '
'@@ Well , I think it is ready now , ' said Dol@@ ly , dri@@ pping sy@@ r@@ up from the spo@@ on .
'@@ When it begins to string , it is ready .
'@@ Oh , these flies ! ' cried Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na cros@@ sly . ' it will come out just the same . '
'@@ Oh , how sweet he is - don '@@ t fri@@ ghten him ! ' exclaimed Kit@@ ty unexpectedly , looking at a spar@@ row that had settled on the rail@@ ing , turned a r@@ asp@@ berry stal@@ k over , and was pec@@ king at it .
'@@ Yes , but keep away from the bra@@ z@@ ier , ' said her mother .
'a pro@@ po@@ s de V@@ aren@@ ka , ' said Kit@@ ty in French , which they had been talking all the time so that Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na should not understand them . ' do you know , M@@ ama , I am somehow expecting it to be settled to @@@ -@@ @ day !
you understand what I mean .
how nice it would be ! '
'@@ What am I to think ?
she is very good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured , but he might ... '
'@@ Oh , but , M@@ ama , try and understand why nothing better could be imagined either for him or for her .
first of all , she is simply charming ! ' ex@@ post@@ ulated Kit@@ ty , cro@@ o@@ king one finger .
'@@ He certainly likes her very much , ' Dol@@ ly chim@@ ed in .
'@@ Secon@@ dly , his position in the world is such that neither property nor the social position of his wife matters to him at all .
'@@ Yes , one certainly can trust her , ' again chim@@ ed in Dol@@ ly .
'@@ Thir@@ dly , she must love him ; and that too is ...
in a word , it would be splendid !
I expect when they come back from the wood it will all be settled .
what do you think , Dol@@ ly ? '
'@@ But don '@@ t get excited ; there is no need at all for you to get excited , ' admon@@ ished her mother .
I think he will propose to @@@ -@@ @ day . '
'@@ ah , how strange it is when and how a man proposes ...
there is a sort of barrier , and suddenly down it goes , ' said Dol@@ ly with a dream@@ y smile , recalling her past with O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ There was nothing special about it - it was quite simple , ' answered the Princess , but her face bri@@ ghtened at the memory .
you really loved him before you were allowed to talk to one another ? '
Kit@@ ty felt a particular charm in being able now to talk with her mother as an equal about those chief events in a woman 's life .
'@@ of course he loved me ; he used to visit us in the country . '
'@@ But how was it decided , M@@ ama ? '
'@@ How well you put it , m@@ ama !
'@@ What words did Constan@@ tine say to you ? '
'@@ He wrote with chal@@ k .
how long ago it seems ! ' she replied .
and the three women med@@ itated silently on the same subject .
she recalled the whole of the winter preceding her marriage and her inf@@ at@@ uation with V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ There 's one thing ... that old love @@@ -@@ @ affair of V@@ aren@@ ka 's , ' she said , following the natural sequence of her thoughts . ' I wished to tell Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev somehow , to prepare him .
'@@ Not all , ' said Dol@@ ly . ' you judge by your own husband .
he is still tor@@ m@@ ented by the memory of V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ You are , ' answered Kit@@ ty , her eyes smiling dream@@ ily .
'@@ But I do not know , ' inter@@ posed the Princess , defending her maternal watch@@ fulness over her daughter , ' what there is in your past to trouble him !
that V@@ ron@@ sky cour@@ ted you ?
such things happen to every girl . '
'@@ no , excuse me ! ' her mother continued . ' and then you yourself would not let me talk it over with V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ Oh M@@ ama ! ' said Kit@@ ty , looking p@@ ained .
'@@ Now@@ adays one can '@@ t hold you girls in ...
your relations with him could not have gone beyond what was proper , else I should have spoken to him myself !
however , my love , it won '@@ t do for you to get ag@@ itated .
please remember that and keep calm . '
'@@ How happily it turned out for Kit@@ ty that Anna came , ' said Dol@@ ly , ' and how un@@ happily for her !
the exact reverse , ' she added , struck by her thought . ' then Anna was so happy and Kit@@ ty considered herself miserable .
I often think of her . '
'@@ She 's not worth thinking about !
a hor@@ rid , disgu@@ sting woman without a heart , ' said their mother , unable to forget that Kit@@ ty had not married V@@ ron@@ sky but Levin .
'@@ About what don '@@ t you want to think ? ' he asked as he came up .
for an instant he felt that he shared Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na 's dissatisfaction that the jam was boiled without water , and with the alien Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky influence in general .
he smiled , however , and went up to Kit@@ ty .
'@@ Well ? ' he asked , looking at her with the expression with which every one addressed her nowadays .
'@@ Qu@@ ite all right , ' replied Kit@@ ty with a smile . ' and your affairs ? '
'@@ the w@@ agg@@ ons 'll hold three times as much as peasant car@@ ts .
'@@ What ? are you going to take Kit@@ ty in the trap ? ' said her mother repro@@ ach@@ fully .
Levin never called the Princess Mam@@ an , as sons @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law usually do , and this dis@@ pleased the Princess .
but though he liked and respected her very much , Levin could not address her so without violating his feeling for his dead mother .
'@@ i don '@@ t wish to see such unreasonable do@@ ings . '
'@@ Well , then I 'll go on foot !
'@@ Well , Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na , is the jam done ? ' asked Levin , smiling at her and wishing to che@@ er her up . ' has it turned out well the new way ? '
'@@ i suppose so .
'@@ You need not comfort me , ma '@@ am !
'@@ Come with us and get mush@@ rooms ! you will show us the right places . ' Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na smiled and shook her head , as much as to say : ' though I should like to be cross with you , I can '@@ t do it . '
'@@ Please follow my advice , ' said the old Princess , ' cover the jam with paper so@@ aked in rum , and then it will not get m@@ oul@@ dy , even without ice . '
they had nothing to say to one another , but he wanted to hear the sound of her voice , which like her look had been changed by pregnancy .
in her voice as in her look there was now a certain soft@@ ness and seriousness , as of a person continually intent on one beloved task .
lean more on me , ' he said .
'@@ no . I am so glad of a chance to be alone with you ; and I own that , nice as it is to have them all , I regret our winter evenings alone together . '
'@@ They were pleasant , but this is still better .
both are better , ' he said , pressing her hand .
'@@ Do you know what we were talking about when you came in ? '
'@@ About the jam ? '
'@@ Yes , about jam , and then ... about how people propose . '
'@@ And about Sergi@@ us and V@@ aren@@ ka .
I want it so much , ' she went on . ' what do you think about it ? ' and she looked into his face .
'@@ i don '@@ t know what to think , ' Levin replied with a smile . ' Sergi@@ us seems very strange to me in that regard .
'@@ Yes - that he was in love with that girl who died ... '
'@@ It happened when I was still a child ; I only knew of it from what I was told .
I remember him at that time .
he was wonder@@ fully charming .
but since then I have observed him with women : he is am@@ i@@ able and some of them please him , but I feel that for him they are simply human beings , not women . '
'@@ Yes , but now with V@@ aren@@ ka ? ...
there seems to be something ... '
he is a peculiar , a wonderful man .
he lives only a spiritual life .
would that lower him ? '
'@@ no , but he is so used to living a purely spiritual life that he C@@ AN@@ NOT reconcile himself to realities , and , after all , V@@ aren@@ ka is a reality ! '
'@@ Yes , but in her there is not so much of that reality as there is in me , I know he would never have loved me .
'@@ Oh no ! he is very fond of you , and it is always such a pleasure to me when my people are fond of you . '
'@@ You think he can '@@ t fall in love , then ? ' said Kit@@ ty , putting his thoughts into her own words .
'@@ Not exactly that he can '@@ t fall in love , ' Levin answered with a smile , ' but he has none of that weakness which is necessary ...
'@@ You envy him because he can '@@ t fall in love ? '
'@@ i envy him because he is better than I am , ' replied he , smiling . ' he does not live for himself .
and so he can be calm and cont@@ ented . '
'@@ And you ? ' said Kit@@ ty with a mo@@ cking smile of loving amusement .
she could not have expressed the sequence of thoughts that made her smile , but the last deduc@@ tion was that her husband , in ext@@ ol@@ ling his brother and depreci@@ ating himself , was not quite sincere .
what are you dissatisfied with ? ' she said with the same smile .
her dis@@ belief in his dissatisfaction with himself was pleasant , and unconsciously he challenged her to give reasons for her dis@@ belief .
'@@ i am happy , but dissatisfied with myself ... ' he answered .
'@@ How can you be dissatisfied if you are happy ? '
'@@ i mean ... How shall I put it ? ...
in my heart I wish for nothing more , except that you shoul@@ d@@ n '@@ t stum@@ ble . Oh dear !
'@@ in what way ? ' asked she , still smiling . ' Don '@@ t you do anything for others ?
'@@ no . I feel it now more than ever - and it is your fault , ' he answered , pressing her arm , ' that it 's not the right thing .
I do it , but it is superficial .
if I could love all that work as I love you ... but of late I have been doing it like a task set me ... '
'@@ Well then , what do you say to Pap@@ a ? ' asked Kit@@ ty . ' is he bad too , because he does nothing for the common good ? '
but one must have your father 's simplicity , clear@@ ness , and kindness , and have I got all that ?
I don '@@ t act and I worry .
'@@ Then would you now like to change places with Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich ? ' asked Kit@@ ty . ' would you prefer to do that public work , and love that given task as he does , and nothing more ? '
'@@ of course not ! ' replied Levin . ' however , I am so happy that I don '@@ t understand anything ...
so you think he will propose to @@@ -@@ @ day ? ' he added after a pause .
'@@ He will , he won '@@ t , ' said Levin , pulling off the ve@@ ined white pet@@ als .
'@@ no , no ! ' exclaimed she , watching his fingers exc@@ it@@ edly as she seized his hand to stop him . ' you 've pulled off two at once . '
'@@ Well then , we won '@@ t count this tiny one , ' said he , picking off a short ill @@@ -@@ @ formed pet@@ al . ' and here 's the trap over@@ taking us . '
V@@ aren@@ ka WITH THE WH@@ ITE ker@@ chief OV@@ ER H@@ ER BL@@ AC@@ K H@@ AIR , surrounded by the children and good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ure@@ dly and cheer@@ fully busy with them , and evidently excited by the possibility of an offer of marriage from a man she liked , looked very attractive .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev walked by her side and did not cease admir@@ ing her .
'@@ If it is so , I must think it over and come to a decision , and not let myself be carried away like a boy by the impulse of the moment , ' he told himself .
when he had gone some forty p@@ aces he stepped behind a sp@@ ind@@ le bush with pink and red ear@@ ring @@@ -@@ @ shaped blos@@ s@@ oms , and paused , knowing that he could no longer be seen .
around him everything was quiet .
suddenly , from the skirts of the wood not far off , he heard V@@ aren@@ ka 's contr@@ al@@ to voice calling to G@@ ris@@ ha , and a smile of pleasure lit up his face .
conscious of that smile , Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev shook his head dis@@ appro@@ v@@ ingly at his own state and taking out a ci@@ gar began to light it .
he was long unable to strike a match against the bark of a birch .
the delicate white outer bark adh@@ ered to the phosph@@ orus , and the light went out .
watching the sheet of smoke , he went on slowly , med@@ itating on his condition of mind .
but it is nothing of the kind . the one thing I can find against it is that when I lost Marie I told myself that I would remain true to her memory .
that is the only thing I can say against my feeling ...
'@@ But , apart from that , however much I searched I could find nothing to say against my feeling .
if I had chosen by reason alone , I could find nothing better ! '
she had all the charm and fresh@@ ness of youth but was no longer a child , and if she loved him , loved him consciously as a woman ought to love . that was one favourable consideration .
the third was : she was religious , not ir@@ responsibly religious and kind @@@ -@@ @ hearted like a child - like Kit@@ ty for instance but her life was based on religious convictions .
and this girl , uniting all the qualities , loved him .
he was modest , but could not help being aware of this .
and he loved her .
one of the opposite arguments was his age .
and what was the use of counting by years , when he felt as young at heart as he had been twenty years ago ?
his heart le@@ apt with joy .
he felt that the matter was decided .
V@@ aren@@ ka , who had bent to pick a mush@@ room , rose bu@@ oy@@ antly and glanced round .
throwing away his ci@@ gar Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev went toward her with resolute steps .
'@@ M@@ LL@@ E V@@ aren@@ ka ! when VER@@ Y YO@@ UN@@ G I formed my ideal of the woman I should love and whom I should be happy to call my wife .
I have lived many years , and now in you for the first time I have met what I was in search of .
I love you , and offer you my hand . '
this was what Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev said to himself when he was already within ten steps of V@@ aren@@ ka .
kne@@ eling and with out@@ stretched arms defending some mush@@ rooms from G@@ ris@@ ha , she was calling little M@@ asha .
'@@ Come along , little ones !
there are a lot here , ' she cried in her delightful mel@@ low voice .
on seeing Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev approaching she did not move ; yet everything told him that she felt his approach and was glad of it .
'@@ Well , have you found anything ? ' she asked from beneath her white ker@@ chief , turning her handsome face toward him , with a gentle smile .
'@@ Not one , ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev . ' and you ? '
she did not reply , being busy with the children who surrounded her .
'@@ There 's another , near the branch , ' she said , pointing to a small mush@@ room cut across its firm p@@ ink@@ ish crown by a dry blade of grass from beneath which it had sp@@ run@@ g up .
V@@ aren@@ ka rose when M@@ asha had picked the mush@@ room , breaking it into two white pieces . ' it reminds me of my childhood , ' she added , moving away from the children with Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev .
they went a few p@@ aces in silence .
V@@ aren@@ ka saw that he wanted to speak , and gu@@ essing the subject she grew faint with joy and fear .
they had gone far enough not to be over@@ heard , but he still had not begun .
it would have been easier after a silence to say what they wished to say than after talking about mush@@ rooms ; yet against her will , and as if by accident , she said :
'@@ So you have not found anything ?
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev sigh@@ ed and did not speak .
he was v@@ exed that she had spoken about mush@@ rooms .
'@@ i have only heard that the white bol@@ eti grow chiefly on the outskirts , but I can '@@ t even tell which are the white ones . '
a few more minutes passed ; they had gone still further from the children and were quite alone .
V@@ aren@@ ka 's heart beat so that she seemed to hear it , and she felt herself growing red and then pale and red again .
to be the wife of a man like Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev after her difficult life with Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l seemed to her the height of bliss .
besides , she was almost sure she loved him , and now in a moment it must be decided .
she was frightened : frightened of what he might or might not say .
'@@ He must make his declaration now or never ' ; Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev also felt this .
everything - V@@ aren@@ ka 's look , her bl@@ ush , her down@@ cast eyes - betrayed painful expectation .
he saw it and was sorry for her .
he even felt that to say nothing now would be to offend her .
his mind went rapidly over all the arguments in favour of his decision .
he repeated to himself the words with which he had intended to propose ; but instead of those words some unexpected thought caused him to say :
V@@ aren@@ ka 's lips trem@@ bled with emotion when she replied :
'@@ the stem of the birch @@@ -@@ @ tree Bol@@ et@@ us reminds one of a dark man 's beard two days old , ' remarked Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev calmly .
'@@ Yes , that 's true , ' answered V@@ aren@@ ka with a smile , and involun@@ tarily the direction of their stroll changed .
they began to return to the children .
V@@ aren@@ ka felt p@@ ained and ashamed , but at the same time she experienced a sense of relief .
he could not be un@@ faithful to Marie 's memory .
'@@ G@@ ently , gently , children ! ' shouted Levin almost an@@ gr@@ ily , stepping in front of his wife to shield her , when the crowd of children came rushing at them with shri@@ eks of delight .
behind the children Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev and V@@ aren@@ ka came out of the wood .
Kit@@ ty had no need to question V@@ aren@@ ka : from the calm and rather shame@@ faced look on both faces she knew that her plan had not been realized .
'@@ Well ? ' inqui@@ red her husband on their way home .
'@@ W@@ on '@@ t bite , ' answered Kit@@ ty with a smile and manner of speaking like her father , which Levin often observed in her with pleasure .
'@@ Like this , ' she said , taking her husband 's hand , raising it to her mouth , and slightly touching it with her closed lips . ' as one kis@@ ses the bishop 's hand . '
'@@ Who won '@@ t bite ? ' said he , laughing .
and it should have been like this ... '
they both experienced what is felt by a pupil who has failed in an examination and has to remain in the same class or be finally expelled from the school .
Levin and Kit@@ ty felt particularly happy and in love with one another that evening .
their happiness in their love involved an unpleasant reflection on those who desired , but had failed , to secure the same happiness , and made them feel ashamed .
they were expecting O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky by the evening train , and the old Prince had written that he would perhaps accompany him .
'@@ And I know why , ' continued the Princess . ' he says young married folk should be left to themselves for a while . '
we have not seen him ... And are we young married folk ? ...
'@@ Only if he do@@ es@@ n '@@ t come I too shall say good @@@ -@@ @ bye to you children , ' said the Princess with a sor@@ row@@ ful sigh .
and suddenly the old Princess 's voice unexpectedly qu@@ aver@@ ed .
'@@ M@@ ama always finds something sad , ' this glance seemed to say .
'@@ What is it , Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na ? ' Kit@@ ty asked suddenly when the old woman stopped in front of her with a look of mystery and importance .
'@@ Oh , that 's just right , ' said Dol@@ ly . ' you go and give your orders , and I will hear G@@ ris@@ ha his lesson .
he h@@ as@@ n '@@ t done anything today . '
'@@ That 's a rebu@@ ke for me !
no , Dol@@ ly ! I will go , ' said Levin , jumping up .
so he went on teaching G@@ ris@@ ha not in his own way but according to the book , and therefore did it half @@@ -@@ @ hear@@ tedly and often missed a lesson .
so it had happened that day .
V@@ aren@@ ka spoke in the same way to Kit@@ ty .
even in the Lev@@ ins ' well @@@ -@@ @ ordered household she found ways to be of use . ' I will see about sup@@ per , ' she said , ' and you stay here ' ; and she rose to accompany Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na .
'@@ Yes , do . I expect they could not get any chickens , but there are our own ... ' answered Kit@@ ty .
'@@ Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na and I will arrange it , ' and V@@ aren@@ ka went out with the old woman .
'@@ What a nice girl ! ' said the Princess .
'@@ Not nice , M@@ ama , but so charming that there is no one else like her ! '
'@@ M@@ ama , he will do all that 's necessary and will agree to everything , ' inter@@ pol@@ ated Kit@@ ty , anno@@ yed with her mother for asking Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev 's opinion on such a matter .
Dol@@ ly had not had time to rise to go to meet her husband , before Levin had jumped out of the window of the room below , where he had been teaching G@@ ris@@ ha , and had lifted the boy out too .
'@@ It 's Steve ! ' shouted Levin from under the balcony . ' we have finished , Dol@@ ly , don '@@ t worry ! ' he added , running like a boy to meet the carriage .
'@@ is , ea , id ; e@@ j@@ us , e@@ j@@ us , e@@ j@@ us , ' shouted G@@ ris@@ ha , hop@@ ping down the avenue .
it must be Pap@@ a ! ' shouted Levin , who had stopped at the bend of the avenue . ' Kit@@ ty , don '@@ t come down those steep steps , go round ! '
but Levin was mistaken in sup@@ posing that one of the men in the cal@@ è@@ che was the old Prince .
when he came nearer he saw , sitting beside O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , a st@@ out handsome young man wearing a Scot@@ ch bon@@ net with long rib@@ bons streaming behind .
it was Vas@@ enka V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky , a second cousin of the Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sk@@ ys , a brilliant Petersburg @@@ -@@ @ Moscow young man . ' a most splendid fellow and a passionate sport@@ sman , ' as O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky said when he introduced him .
Levin did not get in , but followed the cal@@ è@@ che .
he was rather v@@ exed that the old Prince , whom he liked more and more the better he knew him , had not come , and v@@ exed because this Vas@@ enka V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky , a quite super@@ flu@@ ous stranger , had come .
'@@ We , your wife and I , are cous@@ ins and old acquaintances , ' said Vas@@ enka V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky , once again giving Levin 's hand a very , very hard squeeze .
'@@ Well , is there any game ? ' asked O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky of Levin scarcely giving himself time to say a word of greeting to everybody . ' he and I have the cru@@ ell@@ est intentions ...
why , m@@ ama ! they have not been in Moscow since then .@@ ...
here , T@@ anya ! that 's for you ! ...
Levin , who but a few moments before had been in the brightest of spirits , was now looking dis@@ m@@ ally at every one , dissatisfied with everything .
'@@ Who@@ m was he kis@@ sing yesterday with those same lips ? ' he thought as he looked at O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky ca@@ ressing his wife .
he looked at Dol@@ ly , and was not pleased with her either .
'@@ of course she does not believe in his love .
disgu@@ sting ! ' thought he .
and V@@ aren@@ ka too seemed disgu@@ sting because of the manner in which she with her S@@ ain@@ te nit@@ ou@@ che [ Holy un@@ appro@@ achable . ] air made that gentleman 's acquaintance , while all her thought was how to get married .
talking nois@@ ily , they all went into the house , but as soon as all were seated Levin turned and left the room .
Kit@@ ty noticed that something was wrong with her husband .
she tried to seize an opportun@@ e moment to speak to him alone ; but he hur@@ ried away from her , saying that he must go to the office .
it was long since the farm work had seemed so important to him as it did that evening .
'@@ For them it is always a holiday , ' he thought , ' yet here we have work that is no holiday task , which C@@ AN@@ NOT be put off , and without which life is impossible . '
Levin D@@ ID NOT RE@@ T@@ UR@@ N until they called him to sup@@ per .
on the stairs stood Kit@@ ty and Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na , deliber@@ ating what wines to serve .
'@@ But why all this fus@@ s ?
'@@ no ; Steve does not drink it ...
'@@ Well then , shall we go shooting to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row ? ' O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky inqui@@ red .
'@@ Yes ! do let 's go ! ' cried V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky , changing from one chair to another and sitting side@@ ways with one of his fat legs doubled under him .
'@@ i shall be very pleased ! let 's go .
will it tire you ?
are@@ n '@@ t you tired , Steve ? '
let 's not go to bed at all !
'@@ Yes , really ! Don '@@ t let us go to bed ! delightful ! ' chim@@ ed in V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky .
'@@ Oh no , stay here , Dol@@ ly dear ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , stepping across to her side of the long sup@@ per @@@ -@@ @ table . ' I have much more to tell you . '
'@@ Do you know , V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky has been to see Anna ?
and he is going there again .
you know it 's only some seventy ver@@ sts off .
V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky , come here ! '
Vas@@ enka came over to the ladies , and took a seat beside Kit@@ ty .
'@@ Oh , do tell me ! you have been to see her ?
Levin remained at the other end of the table , and while not c@@ easing to talk with the Princess and V@@ aren@@ ka saw that O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , Dol@@ ly , Kit@@ ty , and V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky were carrying on an animated and mysterious conversation .
moreover , he saw his wife had an expression of serious feeling as she gaz@@ ed attentively at Vas@@ enka 's handsome face while he was vi@@ v@@ aci@@ ously nar@@ rating something .
'@@ It 's very nice at their place , ' Vas@@ enka was saying , talking of V@@ ron@@ sky and Anna . ' of course I do not take it upon myself to judge , but in their house one feels oneself to be in a family . '
'@@ What do they mean to do ? '
'@@ i believe they mean to go to Moscow for the winter . '
'@@ How nice it would be for us to meet there !
'@@ i shall spend July with them . '
'@@ And will you go ? ' O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky asked his wife .
I shall go alone when you are away , and won '@@ t in@@ convenience anyone .
'@@ That 's all right , ' replied he ; ' and you , Kit@@ ty ? '
why should I go ? ' said Kit@@ ty , fl@@ ushing deeply and gl@@ ancing round at her husband .
'@@ are you acquainted with Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna ? ' V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky asked her . ' she is very attractive . '
'@@ So you are off shooting to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row ? ' she asked .
Levin 's jealousy during those few minutes had gone far , especially after the bl@@ ush that had suff@@ used her face when speaking to V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky .
now as he listened to her question he interpreted it in his own way .
'@@ Yes , I am going , ' he answered in an un@@ natural voice that was dis@@ agre@@ eable to himself .
'@@ no , wait a day , because Dol@@ ly has seen nothing of her husband . you could go the day after to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row , ' said she .
Levin now interpreted her words thus : ' do not part me from him .
your going does not matter to me , but do let me enjoy the society of this charming young man ! '
'@@ Oh , if you wish it we will stay at home to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row , ' replied Levin with particular am@@ i@@ ability .
meanwhile Vas@@ enka , without the least suspicion of the sufferings his presence was causing , rose from the table after Kit@@ ty and followed her , smiling pleas@@ antly .
Levin saw that smile .
he grew pale and for a moment could hardly breathe .
'@@ How dare he look like that at my wife ! ' he thought , boiling with rage .
please let 's go ! ' said Vas@@ enka , sitting down and once more doubling his leg under him , as his habit was .
Levin 's jealousy rose still higher .
already he f@@ anci@@ ed himself a deceived husband , necessary to his wife and her lover only to provide them with the comforts of life and with pleasures ...
but nevertheless he asked Vas@@ enka in an am@@ i@@ able and hospitable manner about his shooting , his gun , his boots - and agreed to go shooting next day .
happily for Levin the old Princess put a stop to his sufferings by herself getting up and advising Kit@@ ty to go to bed .
but he did not escape a fresh pan@@ g .
taking leave of his host@@ ess , Vas@@ enka again wanted to kiss her hand ; but Kit@@ ty , bl@@ ushing , drew away her hand , and said with naive ru@@ den@@ ess , for which she was afterwards re@@ pri@@ man@@ ded by her mother :
in Levin 's eyes Kit@@ ty was to blame for having laid herself open to such behaviour , and still more to blame for so awk@@ war@@ dly showing that it dis@@ pleased her .
do you know he has a fine voice ? we have been rehear@@ sing on the way .
he has brought some beautiful songs - two new ones .
after the rest had separated for the night O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky long walked in the avenue with V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky , and their voices could be heard practi@@ sing a new song .
he stood before her , his eyes glit@@ tering terribly under his fro@@ w@@ ning brows , and pressed his powerful arms to his breast , as if trying with all his might to restrain himself .
the expression of his face would have been hard and even cruel , but for a look of suffering which touched her .
his jaw trem@@ bled and his voice f@@ altered .
'@@ Under@@ stand that I am not jeal@@ ous : that is a v@@ ile word !
I C@@ AN@@ NOT be jeal@@ ous nor believe that ...
I C@@ AN@@ NOT say what I feel , but it is dreadful ...
I am not jeal@@ ous , but I am offended and humiliated that anyone d@@ ares imagine - d@@ ares look at you with such eyes ... '
'@@ What eyes ? ' said Kit@@ ty , trying to remember as honestly as she could all the words and gestures of the evening and all their shades of meaning .
'@@ And what attraction can there be about me as I am ... '
'@@ ah ! ' he exclaimed , seizing his head in his hands . ' you had better not say anything ! ...
they don '@@ t ! they don '@@ t ! ...
well then , would you like me not to see anybody ? '
'@@ Tr@@ y and understand the horror and absur@@ dity of my position , ' he continued in a des@@ pairing whis@@ per . ' he is in my house , and strictly speaking he has done nothing improper except by his free and easy manner and doubling up his legs !
he considers it to be in the best form , and therefore I have to be polite to him ! '
'@@ Come , Ko@@ st@@ ya , you are exagg@@ erating ! ' re@@ monstr@@ ated Kit@@ ty , at the bottom of her heart pleased by the force of love for her which was now expressing itself in his jealousy .
'@@ the worst of it all is that you - are as you always are , and now when you are my holy of hol@@ ies and we are so happy - so specially happy - suddenly this good @@@ -@@ @ for @@@ -@@ @ nothing comes along ...
but our happiness , mine and yours ... why ... ? '
'@@ Do you know , I see how it happened ... ' Kit@@ ty began .
'@@ How ? how ? '
'@@ i noticed your look while we were talking at sup@@ per . '
she told him what they had been talking about , and while she spoke she was breath@@ less with excitement .
'@@ K@@ ate , I have been tor@@ m@@ enting you !
it was madness !
how could I torture myself like that about such nonsense ? '
because I am a mad@@ man !
it is dreadful to think that a mere stranger can destroy our bliss ! '
'@@ of course , and that is what off@@ ends me ... '
'@@ Well then , I will keep him here all the summer on purpose . I will lav@@ ish atten@@ tions on him , ' said Levin , kis@@ sing her hands .
at length the door opened nois@@ ily and out b@@ ounded , spinning round and round in the air , Kra@@ k , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's yellow spotted pointer , followed by O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky himself with a gun in his hand and a ci@@ gar in his mouth .
'@@ Qui@@ et , quiet , Kra@@ k ! ' he said aff@@ ection@@ ately to the dog , which was throwing its pa@@ ws up against his stomach and chest and getting them ent@@ angled in his game @@@ -@@ @ bag .
Vas@@ enka had been ignorant that the sty@@ lis@@ hness of a real sport@@ sman consists in being dressed in r@@ ags but having one 's shooting implements of the very best quality .
'@@ He has a young wife , ' answered O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , with a smile .
'@@ Sor@@ ry , gentlemen ! ' he said , running out on to the por@@ ch . ' is the lunch put in ?
'@@ Let them out with the flock , ' he said , turning to the her@@ d@@ sman who was waiting for orders about some young sheep . ' sorry ! there 's another r@@ as@@ cal coming . '
Levin jumped down from the cart where he had already seated himself , to meet the carp@@ enter who was approaching with a s@@ az@@ hen measure in his hand .
'@@ W@@ on '@@ t you have one more turning made ?
three more steps will be enough , then we 'll get it exact .
'@@ You should have obeyed me , ' said Levin with v@@ ex@@ ation . ' I told you to set up the string @@@ -@@ @ boards first , and then to make the gro@@ oves .
do as I tell you and make a new one . '
now he wanted to use that staircase , adding three steps to it .
'@@ But where will it reach to with three additional steps ? '
'@@ Exc@@ use me , sir ! ' said the carp@@ enter , smiling cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ously . ' it will reach to the exact spot .
'@@ Why , but three steps will add to its length as well ... Where will it get to ? '
'@@ It will go up from the bottom , I mean , and reach to the top , ' the carp@@ enter repeated obst@@ in@@ ately and persu@@ asi@@ vely .
Levin pulled out his ram@@ rod and drew the staircase in the dust .
'@@ as you please , ' said the carp@@ enter , his eyes suddenly bri@@ ghtening ; evidently he had at last understood . ' it seems we 'll have to make another . '
'@@ Well then , do as I told you , ' Levin shouted as he climbed into the cart . ' drive on !
hold the dogs , Philip ! '
Hav@@ ing@@ - left the cares of home and estate behind him , Levin experienced such a strong sense of the joy of life and anticipation , that he felt dis@@ inclined to talk .
besides , he experienced that feeling of concentrated excitement which every sport@@ sman knows when approaching the scene of action .
'@@ If only I don '@@ t dis@@ grace myself before that stranger !
if only O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's shooting does not beat mine ! ' was his thought .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky shared these feelings and was likewise not tal@@ k@@ ative .
Vas@@ enka V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky alone ch@@ attered incess@@ antly and mer@@ r@@ ily .
now , as he listened to him , Levin felt ashamed of his injustice toward him the day before .
Vas@@ enka was really a good sort , simple , kind @@@ -@@ @ hearted , and very j@@ ol@@ ly .
had Levin come across him when still a bachelor , they would have become intimate .
Levin did not quite like his holiday outlook on life and a sort of free and easy sty@@ lis@@ hness about him .
when they had gone about three ver@@ sts , V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky suddenly missed his ci@@ gars and pocket @@@ -@@ @ book , and did not know whether he had lost them or left them on his table .
he had three hundred and seventy roubles in the pocket @@@ -@@ @ book , and therefore the matter could not be ignored .
'@@ Do you know , Levin , I will gal@@ lo@@ p home on this Don side @@@ -@@ @ horse !
that will be grand , eh ? ' he said , preparing to get out .
'@@ no , why ? ' replied Levin , con@@ jec@@ turing that V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky must weigh not less than fifteen stone . ' I will send the co@@ ach@@ man . '
so the co@@ ach@@ man rode back on the side @@@ -@@ @ horse and Levin drove the other two himself .
'@@ W@@ EL@@ L , WH@@ ERE ARE W@@ E going ?
tell us all about it , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ the plan is this . we are now going as far as G@@ vo@@ z@@ dev@@ o .
'@@ And is there nothing by the way ? '
Levin himself felt inclined to stop at those little places , but , as they were near home , they were always within his reach and they were small , so that there was not room enough for three persons to shoot there .
so he stretched a point and said they would hardly find anything there .
when they came to a small mar@@ sh he wished to drive past it , but O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , with the practi@@ sed eye of a sport man , noticed the marsh@@ y place from the road .
'@@ Ou@@ ght@@ n '@@ t we to go there ? ' he asked , pointing to the mar@@ sh .
'@@ Levin , do let us ! how delightful ! ' beg@@ ged Vas@@ enka V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky , and Levin could not but agree .
scarcely had they stopped before the dogs flew toward the mar@@ sh , racing one another .
the dogs returned .
come along , Levin , let 's go together , ' said V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky .
you don '@@ t want two dogs ? '
Levin remained with the trap and looked en@@ viously at the sportsmen .
they went over the whole mar@@ sh , but there was nothing there except water@@ f@@ owl and some pe@@ e@@ wit@@ s , one of which V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky killed .
'@@ There , you see I was not grud@@ ging you the mar@@ sh ! ' said Levin . ' it only meant losing time . '
you saw ? ' said Vas@@ enka V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky , climbing awk@@ war@@ dly into the cart with his gun and the pe@@ ew@@ it . ' how well I got this one !
well , shall we soon get to the real place ? '
suddenly the horses started , Levin knocked his head against the barrel of some one 's gun , and there was a report .
actually the report came first , but to Levin it seemed the other way about .
what had happened was , that Vas@@ enka V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky when un@@ coc@@ king his gun had pulled one trigger while un@@ coc@@ king the other side .
the charge went into the ground without hurting anyone .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky shook his head and laughed repro@@ ach@@ fully at V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky .
when they reached the second mar@@ sh , which was of considerable size and would take a good deal of time Levin tried to dissu@@ ade them from getting out .
but again V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky persuaded him , and again , the mar@@ sh being a narrow one , Levin as a hospitable host remained with the vehicles .
Kra@@ k immediately went toward the hum@@ mo@@ cks .
Vas@@ enka V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky was the first to follow the dog .
before O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky had time to approach , a sni@@ pe rose .
V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky missed it , and it flew over to an un@@ m@@ own me@@ adow .
the bird was left to V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky .
Kra@@ k found it again and pointed . V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky killed the bird and went back to the vehicles .
'@@ Now you go , and I will remain with the horses , ' he said .
he handed the re@@ ins to V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky and went into the mar@@ sh .
L@@ aska , who had long been wh@@ ining plain@@ tively , as if complaining of the injustice , rushed straight forward to a likely spot covered with hum@@ mo@@ cks and known to Levin , where Kra@@ k had not yet been .
'@@ Why don '@@ t you stop her ? ' shouted O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ She won '@@ t disturb them , ' answered Levin , pleased with his dog and hur@@ rying after her .
L@@ aska became more and more intent on her pursuit , the nearer she got to the hum@@ mo@@ cks .
a small mar@@ sh bird only diverted her attention for an instant .
picking his way , he approached the dog .
'@@ Se@@ ize it ! '
it was not a double @@@ -@@ @ sni@@ pe but a sni@@ pe that rose before the dog .
Levin knew he was aiming behind the sni@@ pe , but fired , nevertheless .
after making sure he had missed , he turned and saw that the trap and horses were no longer on the road but in the mar@@ sh .
without a word of reply to Vas@@ enka , who was assuring him that it was quite dry there , Levin worked silently with the co@@ ach@@ man to dis@@ engage the horses .
when everything was in order and the vehicles had been brought back to the road , Levin gave orders for lunch to be served .
V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky drove SO F@@ AST that they arrived at the mar@@ sh too soon , while it was still hot .
when they got to the real mar@@ sh , the object of their journey , Levin involun@@ tarily wished to rid himself of Vas@@ enka and go about un@@ hindered .
'@@ Well , what shall we do ... ?
it 's a splendid mar@@ sh , and I see there are hawks too , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , pointing at two large birds cir@@ cling above the se@@ dges . ' where there are hawks , there is sure to be game . '
that 's the best place .
I once shot seventeen grou@@ se there ...
'@@ Well then , who goes to the left and who to the right ? ' asked O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . ' the space on the right is broader , so you two go there together , and I will keep to the left , ' he added with affected indifference .
we 'll make the best bag , ' chim@@ ed in Vas@@ enka .
Levin could not avoid agreeing , and they separated .
Levin knew L@@ aska 's method of search - careful and dubious ; he knew it , and expected to see a flight of sni@@ pe .
'@@ V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky , walk beside me - beside me ! ' he whispered with b@@ ated breath to his com@@ rade , who was spl@@ ashing in the water behind him , and the direction of whose gun , after the accidental shot by the Kol@@ pen@@ sky mar@@ sh , involun@@ tarily interested Levin .
'@@ no , I don '@@ t want to hamper you . Don '@@ t trouble about me . '
Vas@@ enka had fired into a flight of duc@@ ks that were cir@@ cling above the mar@@ sh far out of range and were at that moment flying straight toward the sportsmen .
Levin had barely time to turn , before he heard the cry of a sni@@ pe , then another , and a third , and about eight more rose one after the other .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky got one just as it was preparing to begin its z@@ ig@@ z@@ ag flight , and the bird fell like a small lump into the bo@@ g .
while they were re@@ loading another bird rose , and V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky , who had finished re@@ loading , fired two charges of small shot over the water .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky picked up his two sni@@ pe and looked with sparkling eyes at Levin .
'@@ Well , now let 's part , ' he said , and li@@ mp@@ ing with his left foot , and holding his gun ready , he whist@@ led to his dog and went off in one direction .
Levin and V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky went in the other .
Levin , if his first shots were unsuccessful , always became excited and anno@@ yed , and shot badly all the rest of the day .
so it was this time .
there were a great many sni@@ pe .
Levin hur@@ ried , grew impati@@ ent , and became more and more fl@@ ur@@ ried , until at last he fired almost without hope of killing anything .
even L@@ aska seemed to feel this .
shot followed shot .
meanwhile from the opposite side of the mar@@ sh came not frequent but , as it seemed to Levin , significant reports from O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's gun , followed almost every time by a cry to the dog , ' Kra@@ k ! Kra@@ k !
the sni@@ pe unc@@ eas@@ ingly cir@@ cled above the se@@ dges .
the cry near the ground and sound in the air came incess@@ antly from every side . the sni@@ pe that had risen previously and had been flying about descended in front of the sportsmen .
not two but dozens of hawks now soared above the mar@@ sh .
half of those strips were already m@@ own .
though there was little hope of finding as many birds in the un@@ m@@ own strips as on the m@@ own part , Levin , having promised O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky to meet him , went with his companion farther on over the m@@ own and un@@ m@@ own strips .
'@@ H@@ ul@@ lo you sportsmen ! ' shouted one of several peasants who were sitting beside a cart from which the horses had been taken out . ' come and have something with us !
'@@ Come along ! never mind ! ' shouted a mer@@ ry , bear@@ ded , red @@@ -@@ @ faced peasant ; showing a row of white teeth and holding alo@@ ft a green@@ ish vodka bottle that glit@@ tered in the sunshine .
'@@ Q@@ u '@@ est @@@ -@@ @ ce q@@ u '@@ ils dis@@ ent ? ' [ what are they saying ? ] asked V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky .
I should go and have a drink , ' said Levin , not quite dis@@ interest@@ edly , hoping that the vodka would temp@@ t V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky and lure him away .
'@@ Why are they offering it ? '
really , you should go to them .
'@@ You come too ! ' shouted a peasant to Levin .
'@@ Come !
Levin badly wanted a drink of vodka and a bit of bread .
he felt faint and could hardly drag his staggering legs out of the bo@@ g , and for an instant he was in doubt .
his wear@@ iness vanished , at once he went easily through the mar@@ sh toward the dog .
just at his feet rose a sni@@ pe ; he fired and killed it . the dog continued pointing .
'@@ F@@ et@@ ch it ! '
another bird rose before the dog .
at last , after a dis@@ graceful miss , he threw his gun , and hat on the ground .
'@@ no ! I must pull myself together , ' he thought , picked up his gun and hat , called L@@ aska to heel , and got out of the mar@@ sh .
when he reached a dry place he sat down on a hum@@ mo@@ ck , took off his boot and emp@@ tied it , then went back to the mar@@ sh , drank a little of the ru@@ sty water , wet@@ ted the heated barrels and bath@@ ed his face and hands .
feeling refresh@@ ed , he returned to the spot where a sni@@ pe had settled , firmly resolved not to get fl@@ ur@@ ried .
he tried to keep calm , but the same thing happened again .
his finger pulled the trigger before he had taken aim .
he had only five birds in his bag when he came out of the mar@@ sh by the al@@ der gro@@ ve where he was to meet O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
before he saw him , he saw his dog .
Kra@@ k , quite black with sm@@ elly mar@@ sh sli@@ me , sprang out from beneath the up@@ turned root of an al@@ der with the air of a conqu@@ er@@ or and sni@@ ffed at L@@ aska .
behind Kra@@ k , in the shade of the al@@ ders , appeared O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's st@@ ately figure .
he came toward Levin red and per@@ spir@@ ing , with his shirt un@@ but@@ t@@ oned , still li@@ mp@@ ing as before .
you have been firing a good deal ! ' he said with a mer@@ ry smile .
'@@ And you ? ' asked Levin .
but there was no need to ask , for he already saw the full bag .
he had fourteen birds .
'a famous mar@@ sh !
I expect V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky was in your way .
one dog for two people is inconvenient , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , to soften his triumph .
when Levin AND O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky reached THE peasant 'S H@@ UT where Levin used to put up , V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky was there before them .
'@@ i have only just got here .
fancy ! they fed me and gave me drink .
what bread - wonderful !
and they positively would not take any money , and kept on saying , " No offence ! " or something of that sort . '
'@@ Why should they take money ?
do they keep vodka for sale ? ' said the soldier who had at last succeeded in dragging off one wet boot together with a black@@ ened stoc@@ king .
though it was already d@@ us@@ k , none of the sportsmen wanted to sleep .
after fluctu@@ ating between recoll@@ ections and stories of the shooting , of dogs , and of other shooting parties , the talk reached a theme that interested all three .
Mal@@ thus was a well @@@ -@@ @ known railway mag@@ nate .
'@@ i don '@@ t understand you , ' said Levin , rising on his heap of ha@@ y . ' how is it that those people don '@@ t dis@@ gust you ?
I understand that lunch with good cl@@ aret is very nice , but is it possible that that very luxury does not dis@@ gust you ?
all those people , like the holders of our drink @@@ -@@ @ monopolies formerly , get their money in ways that earn contempt - they disregard that contempt - and afterwards , by means of what they have dis@@ honestly earned , they buy off that contempt . '
'@@ Perf@@ ec@@ tly true ! ' chim@@ ed in Vas@@ enka V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky . ' perfectly true !
'@@ Not at all ! ' Levin could hear that O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky said this with a smile ; ' I simply don '@@ t consider him more dishonest than any of the rich merchants or no@@ bl@@ emen .
is it work to get a concession and res@@ ell it ? '
'@@ of course it is work ' .
work in this sense , that if it were not for him and others like him , there would be no railways . '
'@@ But it is not work such as that of a peasant or a sav@@ ant . '
'@@ Gran@@ ted ! but it is work in the sense that his activity yields results : railways .
but then you consider railways useless ! '
'@@ That 's quite another question . I am prepared to admit that they are useful .
but every acquisition out of proportion to the to@@ il contributed is dis@@ hon@@ our@@ able . '
hardly were the monopolies stopped before railways and banks appeared : other means of acquiring wealth without work . '
'@@ Well , all you say may be quite correct and ingen@@ ious ...
in fact I notice a quite un@@ justifiable hostility on the part of the public toward these men , and it seems to me that it is envy ... '
'@@ Oh , no ! that 's not fair , ' said -@@ V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky . ' it can '@@ t be envy , and there is something not clean in their business . '
Levin broke in . ' you say it is unjust for me to receive five thousand while the peasant gets only fifty roubles : that 's true .
it is an injustice and I feel it , but ... '
'@@ Yes , indeed .
'@@ Yes , you feel it , but you won '@@ t give him your estate , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , purpos@@ ely provoking Levin .
'@@ i don '@@ t give it away because nobody demands that of me , and if I wanted to I could not do it , ' replied Levin ; ' besides , there is no one to give it to . '
'@@ Gi@@ ve it to this peasant ; he won '@@ t refuse . '
'@@ Yes , but how should I set about it ?
'@@ i don '@@ t know ; but if you are convinced that you have no right ... '
'@@ i 'm not at all convinced .
on the contrary , I feel that I have no right to give it away , that I have duties toward the land and toward my family . '
'@@ no , allow me - if you consider such inequality unjust , why don '@@ t you act accordingly ? '
'@@ But I do act so , only in a negative sense , in the sense that I will not seek to increase the inequality that exists between my position and theirs . '
'@@ Yes , that is a soph@@ istical explanation , ' put in V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky . ' Oh , our host ! ' he said , addressing a peasant who had opened the cre@@ aking bar@@ n doors and was entering . ' so you are not asleep yet ? '
'@@ no , how can I sleep ?
I thought you gentlemen were asleep , but then I heard you chat@@ ting .
she won '@@ t bite ? ' he asked , cauti@@ ously stepping with bare feet .
'@@ And where are you going to sleep ? '
'@@ Why , the maid @@@ -@@ @ servants close by . '
'@@ If only one could ... go without getting up ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , stretching himself . ' it 's delightful to lie still . '
'@@ Well , then I 'll go alone , ' said V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky , rising quickly and putting on his boots . ' good @@@ -@@ @ bye , gentlemen !
if it 's j@@ ol@@ ly I will call you .
you have treated me to game , and I won '@@ t forget you ! '
'@@ Is@@ n '@@ t he a fine fellow ? ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky when V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky had gone out and the peasant had shut the doors after him .
'@@ Yes , fine , ' answered Levin , continuing to think of the question they had been discussing .
it seemed to him that he had expressed his thoughts and feelings as clearly as he could , yet both the others - sincere and not stupid men - had agreed that he was comfor@@ ting himself with s@@ op@@ hi@@ stry .
this per@@ tur@@ bed him .
'@@ no ! if it were unjust , you could not use such advantages with pleasure ; at any rate I could not .
the chief thing for me is , not to feel guilty . '
'@@ i say , had@@ n '@@ t we really better go ? ' put in O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , evidently weary of the mental strain . ' we can '@@ t go to sleep , you know .
the words he had used when he said he was acting justly in a negative sense occupied his mind .
'@@ is it possible that one can act justly only in a negative sense ? ' he asked himself .
'@@ Has@@ n '@@ t the fresh ha@@ y a strong scent ! ' remarked O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , sitting up . ' nothing will make me sleep .
Vas@@ enka is up to something out there .
Sh@@ an '@@ t we go too ?
'@@ no , I am not going , ' answered Levin .
'@@ May@@ be you are stopping here on principle ? ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , smiling , as he searched in the dark for his cap .
'@@ no , not on principle , but why should I go ? '
'd '@@ you know , you will bring trouble on yourself , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , having found his cap and getting up .
'@@ Why ?
'@@ Don '@@ t I see how you have placed yourself with your wife ?
I heard you discussing as a question of first @@@ -@@ @ rate importance , whether you should go away shooting for two days or not !
that 's all very well for an id@@ y@@ ll , but it can '@@ t last a lifetime .
a man should be independent - he has his own mascul@@ ine interests .
a man must be man@@ ly , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , opening the door .
'@@ is that to say , he should court the maid @@@ -@@ @ servants ? ' asked Levin .
my wife won '@@ t be the worse for it , and I shall have a sp@@ ree .
nothing of that kind at home ; but you need@@ n '@@ t tie your hands . '
'@@ Per@@ haps ! ' said Levin dr@@ ily , and turned on his side . ' to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row one should start early , and I shall wake no one but shall start at day@@ break . '
Ven@@ ez v@@ ite ! ' [ gentlemen , come quickly . ] came the voice of V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky , who had come back .
Char@@ man@@ te ! a perfect Gre@@ t@@ chen , and I have already made her acquaintance .
really , very pretty ! ' he said in such an approving way , as if she had been made pretty specially for him , and he was satisfied with the maker .
Levin pre@@ tended to be asleep , but O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , having put on his slippers and lit a ci@@ gar , left the bar@@ n , and their voices soon died away .
'@@ Can it be only done in a negative sense ? ' Levin repeated to himself .
well , perhaps Steve is right !
I am not man@@ ly with her , I have grown eff@@ em@@ inate ...
through his sleep he heard laughter and V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky 's and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's mer@@ ry talk .
he opened his eyes for an instant : they were standing chat@@ ting in the open doorway , brightly lit up by the moon which had now risen .
waking AT E@@ AR@@ LY dawn Levin tried to r@@ ouse his companions .
Vas@@ enka , lying prone with one stock@@ ing@@ ed leg out@@ stretched , was sleeping so s@@ oundly that it was impossible to get any answer out of him .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , half asleep , refused to bu@@ dge so early .
even L@@ aska , sleeping cur@@ led into a ring on a corner of the ha@@ y heap , got up reluctantly , and laz@@ ily stretched and adjusted first one h@@ ind leg and then the other .
only one of them was laz@@ ily eating o@@ ats , sc@@ attering them over the edge of the tr@@ ough .
the outside world was still grey .
'@@ Why have you risen so early , my dear ? ' said his aged host@@ ess , who came out of her hu@@ t , addressing him cor@@ di@@ ally as a good old acquaintance .
L@@ aska ran ahead g@@ aily along the foot@@ path , and Levin followed at a b@@ risk pace , continually gl@@ ancing at the sky .
he did not wish the sun to rise before he reached the mar@@ sh .
they were shocks of ry@@ e .
in the transl@@ uc@@ ent sti@@ ll@@ ness of the morning the slightest sounds were audi@@ ble .
he looked close and saw another and a third .
they all came from behind the w@@ attle fence of an api@@ ary , and flying across the hem@@ p @@@ -@@ @ field disappeared in the direction of the mar@@ sh .
not far from them , three hob@@ bled horses were moving about .
L@@ aska walked beside her master , seeking permission to run forward and looking around .
L@@ aska paused with a mo@@ cking look at the horses and a questioning one at Levin .
he stro@@ ked her , and whist@@ led as a sign that she might now set off .
here and there among the mar@@ sh mos@@ ses and doc@@ ks , that smell was very strong ; but it was impossible to decide in which direction it grew stronger or weaker .
after inhal@@ ing the air with dist@@ ended no@@ str@@ ils she knew at once that not their scent only but they themselves were there , before her , not one only but many of them .
she sl@@ ack@@ ened speed .
they were there , but she could not yet determine exactly where .
to decide this she began working round in a circle , when her master 's voice disturbed her .
'@@ L@@ aska ! here ! ' he said , pointing to the other side .
she stood still , as if asking him whether it would not be better to continue as she had begun ; but he repeated his command in a stern voice , pointing to a group of hum@@ mo@@ cks covered with water where there could not be anything .
she obeyed , pretending to search in order to please him , went over the whole place and then returned to the first spot and immediately s@@ cent@@ ed them once more .
the short@@ ness of her legs prevented her seeing anything before her , but from the scent she could tell that it was not five p@@ aces off .
she stood , more and more conscious of its presence and enjoying the anticipation .
her rigid tail was out@@ stretched , only its very tip t@@ wit@@ ching .
her mouth was slightly open and her ears erect .
one of her ears had turned back while she ran , she breath@@ ed heavily but cauti@@ ously , and yet more cauti@@ ously looked toward her master , turning her eyes rather than her head .
he , with his familiar face but ever terrible eyes , came stumbling over the hum@@ mo@@ cks , but unusually slowly , she thought .
so it seemed to her , though in reality he was running .
having come close up to her he looked beyond , and from his height saw with his eyes what she had found with her nose .
it sat with turned head , listening .
then , just spreading its wings slightly and folding them again , it vanished round a corner with an awkward backward jer@@ k .
'@@ But I can '@@ t go , ' thought she . ' where should I go to ?
from here I scent them , but if I go forward I shall not know what I am doing , nor where they are nor who they are . '
but now he pushed her with his knee , saying in an excited whis@@ per , ' Se@@ ize it , L@@ aska ! seize it ! '
'@@ Well , if he wishes it , I will , but I can no longer answer for anything , ' . thought L@@ aska , and rushed forward at full tilt between the hum@@ mo@@ cks .
she now s@@ cent@@ ed nothing more , but only saw and heard without understanding anything .
another rose behind Levin without waiting to be disturbed by the dog .
by the time Levin had turned toward it , it had already gone far : but his shot reached it .
after flying some twenty feet , the second sni@@ pe rose at an acute angle , and then , turning round and round like a ball , fell heavily on a dry spot .
'@@ Now , things will go right , ' thought Levin , putting the warm fat sni@@ pe into his bag . ' eh , L@@ aska dear , will things go right ? '
when , having re@@ loaded , Levin went on again , the sun , though still invisible because of the clouds , had already risen .
the moon had lost all her brilli@@ ancy and gle@@ amed like a little cloud in the sky . not a single star was any longer visible .
the blu@@ ish gr@@ asses had turned yel@@ low@@ ish green .
Mar@@ sh birds were busy in the de@@ w @@@ -@@ @ b@@ esp@@ angled bushes that cast long shadows beside the bro@@ ok .
a haw@@ k had woke up and was sitting on a ha@@ y@@ cock , turning its head from side to side and looking dis@@ cont@@ ent@@ edly at the mar@@ sh .
the powder @@@ -@@ @ smoke spread like milk over the green grass .
a boy ran up to Levin .
'@@ Uncle , there were duc@@ ks here yesterday ! ' he shouted , following Levin from af@@ ar .
and Levin felt increased pleasure in killing three sni@@ pe one after another within sight of this little boy , who expressed his approval .
the sport@@ sman 'S saying , that if you don '@@ t miss your first beast or first bird your day will be successful was justified .
the tale was correct , and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's envy grati@@ fied Levin .
he was also pleased that on his return he found a messenger had already arrived from Kit@@ ty with a note .
'@@ i am quite well and happy .
if you were uneasy about me , you may be quite at ease now .
I have a new body@@ guard - Mary Vl@@ asy@@ evna , ' this was the mid@@ wife , a new and important person@@ age in the Lev@@ ins ' family life .
'@@ She has come to see me and finds me perfectly well , and we have got her to stay till your return .
all are cheerful and well , so don '@@ t hurry and even stay another day if your sport is good . '
these two jo@@ ys , his successful shooting and the news from his wife , were so great that two small un@@ pleas@@ ant@@ nesses which occurred after the shooting were easy to disregard .
one was that the ch@@ est@@ nut side @@@ -@@ @ horse , having evidently been over@@ worked the previous day , was off its feed and seemed dull .
'@@ It was over@@ driven yesterday , Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich , ' he said . ' why , it was driven hard for ten ver@@ sts ! '
it turned out that there were no pies , nor even any chicken left !
'@@ He has an appetite ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , laughing and pointing to Vas@@ enka V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky . ' I don '@@ t suffer from lack of appetite , but he 's quite surprising ... '
'@@ Well , it can '@@ t be helped ! ' said Levin , looking mor@@ os@@ ely at V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky . ' well then , bring me some beef , Philip ! '
'@@ the beef has been eaten , and the bone was given to the dogs , ' answered Philip .
later on , when he had satisfied his hunger with the milk , he felt ashamed of having shown anno@@ y@@ ance to a stranger , and he began laughing at his hungry irritation .
in the evening they again went out shooting , when V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky also killed some birds , and late at night they set off home .
the drive back was as mer@@ ry as the drive out had been .
these words particularly am@@ used V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky .
'@@ Al@@ together I am aw@@ fully pleased with our ou@@ ting ...
and you , Levin ? '
'@@ i am very pleased with it too , ' said Levin sincerely . he was glad not only to feel no hostility such as he had felt at home toward Vas@@ enka V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky ; but on the contrary to feel quite friendly toward him .
next M@@ OR@@ N@@ ING AT TE@@ N O '@@ C@@ LO@@ C@@ K Levin , having made the round of his farm , knocked at the door of Vas@@ enka 's room .
'@@ En@@ tre@@ z ! ' shouted V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky . ' excuse me - I have only just finished my ab@@ lu@@ tions , ' he said smiling , as he stood before Levin in his under@@ clothes .
'@@ Please don '@@ t mind me , ' and Levin sat down by the window . ' have you slept well ? '
'@@ Like the dead !
what a day it is for shooting ! '
'@@ What do you drink , tea or coffee ? '
I expect the ladies are already up ?
when they had walked round the garden , visited the st@@ ables , and even done some gymnastics together on the parallel bars , Levin returned to the house with his guest and entered the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room with him .
'@@ We had fine sport , and so many new impressions ! ' said V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky , approaching Kit@@ ty , who sat at the sam@@ ov@@ ar . ' what a pity ladies are deprived of that pleasure . '
'@@ Well , what of it ? he must say something to the mistress of the house , ' Levin told himself .
he again thought he noticed something in the smile and conqu@@ ering air with which the visitor addressed Kit@@ ty .
the Princess , who sat at the other end of the table with Mary Vl@@ asy@@ evna and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , called Levin and began a conversation about moving to Moscow for Kit@@ ty 's confin@@ ement and taking a house there .
but the Princess did not understand his feelings and attributed his unwillingness to think and speak about it to though@@ t@@ lessness and indifference , and therefore gave him no peace .
she was now commissioning O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky to see about a house , and called Levin to her .
do as you think best , ' he said .
'@@ You must decide when you will move . '
I know that millions of children are born without Moscow and without doctors ; then why ... '
'@@ But one can '@@ t talk to Kit@@ ty about it !
why , do you want me to fri@@ ghten her ?
'@@ i will do whatever you tell me to , ' he replied mor@@ os@@ ely .
the Princess began telling him , but he did not listen to her .
though this talk with the Princess upset him , it was not that but what he saw by the sam@@ ov@@ ar which made him mor@@ ose .
'@@ no , this is impossible , ' he thought , gl@@ ancing occasionally at Vas@@ enka , who was leaning toward Kit@@ ty and saying something , with his handsome smile , and at Kit@@ ty , bl@@ ushing and ag@@ itated .
there was something imp@@ ure in Vas@@ enka 's attitude , his look and his smile .
Levin even saw something imp@@ ure in Kit@@ ty 's pose and smile ; and again the light faded from his eyes .
again , as on the previous occasion , he suddenly , without the least interval , felt thrown from the height of happiness , peace , and dignity into an abyss of despair , mal@@ evol@@ ence , and degradation .
again everyone and everything became revol@@ ting to him .
'@@ Well then , Princess , let it be just as you think best , ' he said , turning away .
' " heavy is the Auto@@ cr@@ at 's crown ! " [ a quotation from Pushkin 's Boris Go@@ du@@ nov . ] said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky ban@@ ter@@ ingly , evidently allu@@ ding not only to the Princess 's conversation , but also to the cause of Levin 's agitation , which he had observed . ' how late you are to @@@ -@@ @ day , Dol@@ ly ! '
Vas@@ enka only rose for a moment , and with the absence of polit@@ eness to women which is characteristic of modern young men , barely bowed and again continued his conversation , laughing at something .
the conversation with Kit@@ ty begun by Vas@@ enka again dealt with Anna and with the question whether love can rise above social conditions .
this conversation was unpleasant to Kit@@ ty and upset her , both by the subject itself and by the tone in which it was carried on , but especially because she already knew the effect it would have on her husband .
but she was too simple and innocent to know how to stop it , or even how to conceal the superficial pleasure which this young man 's evident atten@@ tions caused her .
she wished to put an end to the conversation , but did not know how .
whatever she did , she knew , would be noticed by her husband and would all be constr@@ ued into something wrong .
'@@ Well , shall we go to pick mush@@ rooms to @@@ -@@ @ day ? ' said Dol@@ ly .
this guilty look confirmed all his suspicions .
he went down@@ stairs , but had not had time to leave his study before he heard his wife 's familiar footsteps following him with im@@ prudent rap@@ idity .
'@@ What is it ? ' he asked dr@@ ily . ' we are busy . '
'@@ Exc@@ use me , ' she said addressing the German mechan@@ ic , ' I have a few words to say to my husband . '
'@@ the train is at three ? ' asked the German , ' I must not miss it . '
Levin did not answer him but went out with his wife .
'@@ Well , what have you to say to me ? ' he asked in French .
he did not look her in the face and did not notice that she ( in her condition ) stood with her whole face t@@ wit@@ ching , and had a p@@ iti@@ ful , crushed appearance .
'@@ i ... I want to tell you that it 's impossible to live like this - it 's torture ! ' she mut@@ tered .
'@@ the servants are there , in the pan@@ try , ' he said an@@ gr@@ ily ; ' don '@@ t make a scene . '
'@@ Well then , come here ! '
'@@ Well , come into the garden ! '
'@@ One can '@@ t live like this !
it is torture !
why ? ' she asked , when they had at last reached a seclu@@ ded seat at the corner of the lime @@@ -@@ @ tree avenue .
'@@ There was , ' she said in a trembling voice . ' but , Ko@@ st@@ ya , do you really not see that I am not to blame ?
from the time I came down I wanted to adopt a tone ... but these people ...
why did he come ?
how happy we were ! ' she said , cho@@ king with so@@ bs that shook the whole of her expanded body .
she too was in great trouble that day .
'@@ Oh , she is a hor@@ rid child ! ' she cried , addressing Levin . ' where do these v@@ ile tendencies in her come from ? '
'@@ But what has she done ? ' asked Levin rather in@@ differently . he wanted to consult her about his own affairs , and was anno@@ yed at having come at an in@@ opportun@@ e moment .
Dol@@ ly told M@@ asha 's crime .
'@@ That proves nothing ; it is not a bad tendency but just mis@@ chiev@@ ousness , ' Levin comfor@@ ted her .
'@@ But you are upset about something ?
why have you come ? ' asked Dol@@ ly , ' What 's happening there ? '
and by the tone of her question Levin knew that it would be easy for him to tell her what he meant to say .
'@@ i was not there , but have been in the garden alone with Kit@@ ty .
we have quar@@ rel@@ led for the second time since ...
Dol@@ ly gaz@@ ed at him with wise , compreh@@ ending eyes .
'@@ Well , tell me , hand on heart - was there ... not on Kit@@ ty 's side , but on that gentleman 's ... a tone which might be unpleasant ... not unpleasant but terrible and offensive to a husband ? '
'@@ Not I only , but Steve too .
'@@ Well , all right , now I am tran@@ qui@@ l .
I will turn him out , ' said Levin .
'@@ But you will quarrel ? '
'@@ Not at all !
it will be a pleasure for me , a real pleasure , ' said Levin with sparkling eyes . ' come , forgive her , Dol@@ ly !
the little girl burst into so@@ bs and buried her face in her mother 's lap , and Dol@@ ly placed her thin tender hand on the child 's head .
'@@ What is there in common between us and him ? ' thought Levin , as he went in search of V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky .
passing through the hall he ordered the cal@@ è@@ che to be harn@@ essed to drive to the station .
'@@ One of the springs broke yesterday , ' replied the foot@@ man .
Levin found Vas@@ enka , who had un@@ packed his port@@ man@@ te@@ au and spread out his new songs , trying on a pair of leg@@ g@@ ings and preparing for a ride .
'@@ Yes , it 's much cleaner , ' said Vas@@ enka , placing his fat foot on a chair , fast@@ ening the bottom hook , and smiling good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ure@@ dly .
he was certainly a good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured fellow , and Levin felt sorry for him and ashamed of himself as a host when he noticed the sh@@ y@@ ness of Vas@@ enka 's look .
on the table lay a piece of stick which when doing gymnastics that morning they had broken , trying to raise the war@@ ped parallel bars .
Levin took the broken stick and began pulling off the spl@@ inter@@ ed bits at the end , not knowing how to begin .
'@@ i wished ... ' He stopped , but suddenly remembering Kit@@ ty and all that had happened , he said , looking V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky firmly in the eyes : ' I have ordered the horses to be harn@@ essed for you . '
'@@ What do you mean ? ' Vas@@ enka began with surprise . ' to drive where ? '
'@@ Why , are you going away , or has anything happened ? '
'@@ It happens that I am expecting visitors , ' replied Levin more rapidly , breaking off the spl@@ inter@@ ed bits of the stick with his strong fingers . ' or no , I am not expecting visitors and nothing has happened , yet I request you to leave .
you may explain my im@@ polit@@ eness as you please . '
'@@ i ask you for an explanation , ' he said with dignity , having at last understood .
'@@ i can '@@ t give you an explanation , ' said Levin softly and slowly , trying to control the trembling of his jaw , ' and it is better for you not to ask . '
as the spl@@ inters were now all broken off , Levin grasped the thick ends in his fingers and split the stick , carefully catching a piece as it fell .
probably the sight of those strained arms , those muscles he had felt that morning when doing gymnastics , and the gle@@ aming eyes , low voice and trembling j@@ aws , convinced Vas@@ enka more than the words .
he shrugged his shoulders , smiled cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ously , and bowed .
'@@ Can I not see O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky ? '
the sh@@ rug and smile did not irrit@@ ate Levin .
'@@ What else is there for him to do ? ' he thought .
what fly has stun@@ g you ?
but the place where the fly had stun@@ g Levin was evidently still sore , for he again grew pale when O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky wished to refer to his reason , and hastily interrupted him .
'@@ Please don '@@ t explain my reasons !
I feel ashamed before you and before him .
but I don '@@ t think it will gri@@ eve him much to go away , and his presence is unpleasant to me and to my wife . '
'@@ And I feel insul@@ ted and tortured !
and I have done nothing wrong and don '@@ t deserve to suffer . '
'@@ Well , I never expected this of you !
Levin turned away from him quickly and went far down one of the avenues , where he continued walking up and down alone .
'@@ What does that mean ? ' wondered Levin when the foot@@ man ran out of the house and stopped the vehicle .
it was on account of the mechan@@ ic , whom Levin had quite forgotten .
he bowed and said something to V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky , then climbed into the tar@@ ant@@ as , and they drove away together .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky and the Princess were indig@@ n@@ ant at Levin 's conduct .
'@@ And who was inside the cart ? who but Vas@@ enka , with his Scot@@ ch bon@@ net and his songs and his leg@@ g@@ ings , sitting on the ha@@ y ! '
'@@ at least you might have let him have the br@@ ou@@ g@@ ham ! ...
and then I hear : " stop ! "
Dol@@ ly carried O@@ UT H@@ ER intention of going to see Anna .
not to depend on the Lev@@ ins for that journey , Dol@@ ly sent to the village to hire horses ; but Levin hearing of it came and repro@@ ached her .
'@@ Why do you think your going would be unpleasant to me ?
even if it were unpleasant it would be still more unpleasant for me if you did not use my horses , ' he said . ' you never told me definitely that you were going .
and that you should hire horses in the village is , in the first place , unpleasant to me , and besides that , they will undertake the job but won '@@ t get you there .
acting on Levin 's advice , Dol@@ ly started before day@@ break .
the road was good , the cal@@ è@@ che comfortable , the horses ran mer@@ r@@ ily , and on the box beside the co@@ ach@@ man instead of a foot@@ man sat an office cler@@ k whom Levin sent with her for safety .
Dol@@ ly do@@ zed , and only woke up when approaching the inn where the horses were to be changed .
her thoughts seemed strange to her .
at first she thought of the children , about whom , though the Princess and especially Kit@@ ty ( she had greater faith in Kit@@ ty ) had promised to look after them , she still felt anxious .
'@@ If only M@@ asha does not get into mis@@ chief again , or a horse does not kick G@@ ris@@ ha , and if only L@@ ily 's digestion does not get more upset . '
she began thinking that she would have to move into another house in Moscow for the winter , have the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room furniture re @@@ -@@ @ covered , and a new winter coat made for the el@@ dest girl .
then came problems of a more remote future : how she should start her children in the world .
'@@ at present I am teaching G@@ ris@@ ha , but that is only because I am free now and not having a baby .
of course Steve is not to be counted on , but with the help of kind people I shall start them somehow ... But in case of another child ... '
and it occurred to her how inaccurate it is to say that woman 's curse is the bringing forth of children .
'@@ Trav@@ ail , that 's nothing - but pregnancy is torture , ' she thought , with her last pregnancy and the death of her infant in mind .
'@@ i had one girl , but God released me . I buried her in L@@ ent . '
'@@ And are you very sorry ? ' asked Dol@@ ly .
you can '@@ t work or anything .
this answer had seemed horrible to Dol@@ ly , despite the good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured sweet@@ ness of the young woman 's looks , but now she could not help recalling it .
in those cynical words there was some truth .
even Kit@@ ty - young , pretty Kit@@ ty - how much plain@@ er she has become ! and I when I am pregnant become hide@@ ous , I know .
trav@@ ail , suffering , monstr@@ ous suffering , and that final moment ... then nursing , sle@@ e@@ pless nights , and that awful pain ! '
Dol@@ ly sh@@ ud@@ dered at the mere thought of the pain she had endured from sore nip@@ ples , from which she had suffered with almost every baby .
it is all so incomprehensible and difficult .
'@@ And what is it all for ?
what will come of it all ?
even now , if we had not spent this summer with Ko@@ st@@ ya and Kit@@ ty , I don '@@ t know how we should have managed .
of course Ko@@ st@@ ya and Kit@@ ty are so consider@@ ate that we don '@@ t feel it ; but it can '@@ t go on so .
is Pap@@ a , who has kept scarcely anything for himself , to help us ? ...
so I can '@@ t even give the children a start myself , unless it 's with other people 's help and with humiliation .
that is all I can hope for .
and for this , so much suffering and trouble ...
again she remembered what the young woman had said . again the recoll@@ ection was re@@ pul@@ sive to her , but she could not help admitting that there was a measure of crude truth in the words .
'@@ is it much further , Michael ? ' she asked the cler@@ k , to dis@@ pel the thoughts that frightened her .
'@@ They say it 's seven ver@@ sts from this village . '
the women stopped on the bridge , inqui@@ si@@ tively scrutin@@ izing the cal@@ è@@ che .
all the faces turned toward her seemed to Dol@@ ly to be healthy and bright , mo@@ cking her with their joy in life .
everybody lives : these women , and my sister Nat@@ aly , and V@@ aren@@ ka , and Anna to whom I am going , - only not I !
am I better than she ?
I at least have a husband whom I love .
not as I wished to love , but still I do love him ; but Anna did not love hers .
she wishes to live .
God has im@@ planted that need in our souls .
it is quite possible I might have done the same .
I don '@@ t even now know whether I did well to listen to her at that terrible time when she came to me in Moscow .
I ought then to have left my husband and begun life anew .
I might have loved and been loved , the real way .
and is it better now ?
is that any better ?
I was still attractive then , still had my good looks , ' she went on , feeling that she wanted to see herself in a glass .
and the most passionate and impossible roman@@ ces occurred to Dol@@ ly 's fancy .
'@@ Anna has acted excell@@ ently , and I at any rate shall not repro@@ ach her at all .
like Anna , she confessed everything to her husband , and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's surprise and embarrassment at the announcement made her smile .
wrapped in such dreams she reached the turning from the high road , which led to Vo@@ z@@ d@@ vi@@ zhen@@ sk .
the co@@ ach@@ man ST@@ OP@@ PE@@ D THE horses and looked round toward a field of ry@@ e on the right , where some peasants sat beside a cart .
the cler@@ k wished to get down , but then , changing his mind , shouted author@@ itatively and bec@@ k@@ oned to a peasant .
the metallic sound of a sc@@ y@@ the being ham@@ mer@@ ed beside the cart ceased , and one of the peasants rose and came toward the cal@@ è@@ che .
the cur@@ ly @@@ -@@ @ headed old man , with a piece of b@@ ast tied round his head , his rounded back dark with per@@ spir@@ ation , increased his speed , approached the cal@@ è@@ che and put his sun@@ burnt arm on the mud @@@ -@@ @ guard .
'@@ are they at home , my good man ? ' said Dol@@ ly vagu@@ ely , not knowing how to speak of Anna even to a peasant .
what do you want ? ' he turned toward a l@@ ad beside the cart who was shouting something .
and who may you be ? '
'@@ i tell you it 's just there , where you come out , ' and he went on rubbing his hand along the mud @@@ -@@ @ guard of the cal@@ è@@ che .
'@@ There , you see , when you 've turned to the left you 'll knock straight up against it , ' said the peasant , evidently unwilling to let them go , and wishing to talk .
it was V@@ ron@@ sky with his j@@ ockey , V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky and Anna on horse@@ back , and Princess Barbara with S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky in the cha@@ r @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ Ban@@ c .
Anna rode in front beside V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky .
she rode quietly , on a small stur@@ dy English co@@ b with a close @@@ -@@ @ cro@@ pped man@@ e and short tail .
Dol@@ ly was struck by the beauty of her head with locks of black hair which had escaped from under her top hat , her full shoulders and fine waist in the black riding @@@ -@@ @ habit , and her whole quiet graceful bearing .
for a moment she thought it improper for Anna to be riding on horse@@ back .
despite her elegance , everything about Anna - her bearing , clothes and movements - was so simple , quiet , and dignified that nothing could seem more natural .
behind them rode V@@ ron@@ sky .
he was on a thorough@@ bred dark bay , which was obviously heated by gal@@ lo@@ ping , and he was using the re@@ ins to hold it in .
behind him rode a short man dressed as a j@@ ockey .
Anna 's face immediately bri@@ ghtened into a joyful smile when she recognized Dol@@ ly in the little figure pressed back in a corner of the old cal@@ è@@ che .
riding up to the cal@@ è@@ che she jumped un@@ aided from the horse and , holding up her habit , ran toward Dol@@ ly .
'@@ It 's what I thought , but dared not expect !
what a pleasure !
you C@@ AN@@ NOT imagine how delighted I am ! ' she cried , now pressing her face to Dol@@ ly 's and kis@@ sing her , now leaning back to gaze smil@@ ingly at her .
'@@ What joy , Alex@@ is ! ' she said , turning to V@@ ron@@ sky , who had dis@@ mounted and was walking toward them .
V@@ ron@@ sky , taking off his grey top hat , approached Dol@@ ly .
'@@ You can have no idea how pleased we are that you have come ; ' he said , putting peculiar emphasis into his words , while a smile exposed his strong white teeth .
Vas@@ enka V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky , without dis@@ mounting , raised his cap and welcomed the visitor , joy@@ ously wav@@ ing his rib@@ bons above his head .
'@@ Oh ! ' said Dol@@ ly , and her face involun@@ tarily expressed dis@@ pleasure .
she knew that the Princess Barbara had all her life been a han@@ ger @@@ -@@ @ on to various rich relatives , but that she - a relation of Dol@@ ly 's husband - should now be living in the house of V@@ ron@@ sky , a perfect stranger to her , offended Dol@@ ly .
Anna noticed Dol@@ ly 's expression , became confused , bl@@ ushed , let her habit slip out of her hands , and stum@@ bled over it .
Dol@@ ly walked up to the cha@@ r @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ Ban@@ c and col@@ dly greeted Princess Barbara .
she was acquainted with S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky too .
he asked how his friend the c@@ rank was getting on with his young wife , and having glanced at the ill @@@ -@@ @ matched horses and the pat@@ ched mud @@@ -@@ @ guard of the cal@@ è@@ che , offered the ladies seats in the cha@@ r @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ bane .
'@@ i will go in that vehicle , ' he said . ' my horse is a quiet one , and the Princess drives splen@@ di@@ dly . '
'@@ no , stay as you are , ' said Anna , who had also come up , ' and we two will go in the cal@@ è@@ che , ' and giving Dol@@ ly her arm she led her away .
Dol@@ ly was dazz@@ led by the elegant equip@@ age of a kind she had never seen , by the beautiful horses and the elegant , brilliant persons about her .
but what struck her most was the change that had taken place in Anna , whom she knew and loved .
another woman less observ@@ ant , who had not known Anna before , especially one who had not thought the thoughts that were in Dol@@ ly 's mind on the way , would not have noticed anything peculiar in Anna .
but now Dol@@ ly was struck by that temporary beauty which only comes to women in moments of love , and which she now found in Anna 's face .
when the two women took their seats in the cal@@ è@@ che , both were seized with sh@@ y@@ ness .
Philip the co@@ ach@@ man and the cler@@ k shared that feeling .
the cler@@ k , to hide his embarrassment , bust@@ led about , helping the ladies in , but Philip became mor@@ ose and made up his mind not to be imposed upon by this eternal superiority .
he smiled ironically as he glanced at the ra@@ ven tro@@ t@@ ter of the cha@@ r @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ Ban@@ c , deciding that that horse was good for nothing but a pro@@ men@@ ade , and could not do its forty ver@@ sts on a hot day at one go .
the peasants beside the cart all got up and looked with mer@@ ry curiosity at the visitor , making their own comments .
'@@ There now , Uncle Ger@@ asi@@ m ! that ra@@ ven g@@ el@@ ding would cart the she@@ aves in no time . '
is that a woman in bre@@ ech@@ es ? ' cried one , pointing to Vas@@ enka V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky , who was getting into the side @@@ -@@ @ sadd@@ le .
'@@ no , it 's a man .
see how easily he jumped up ! '
'@@ i say , lad@@ s ! it seems we are not to have a sleep ! '
'@@ What chance of a sleep to @@@ -@@ @ day ? ' said the old man bl@@ inking at the sun . ' it 's too late !
'@@ You are looking at me , ' she said , ' and wondering whether I can be happy , placed as I am ?
I am ashamed to confess it , but I ... I am unfor@@ gi@@ v@@ ably happy !
something magical has happened to me : like a dream when one feels frightened and cre@@ ep@@ y , and suddenly w@@ akes up to the knowledge that no such terr@@ ors exist .
I have lived through sufferings and terr@@ ors , but for a long time past - especially since we came here - I have been happy ! ... ' she said , looking at Dol@@ ly tim@@ idly and with a questioning smile .
'@@ i am so glad ! ' answered Dol@@ ly , smiling , but in a col@@ der tone than she intended . ' I am very glad for your sake .
why did you not write to me ? '
'@@ Why ? ...
because I did not dare ... you forget my position . '
if only you knew how I ...
I consider ... '
Dol@@ ly wanted to tell Anna what she had been thinking that morning , but for some reason it now seemed out of place .
what are all those buildings ? quite a town ! ' she asked , to change the subject , pointing to the red and green roofs visible above a living green wall of ac@@ aci@@ as and L@@ il@@ ac@@ s .
'@@ It goes all right , Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna ! ' he shouted .
Anna did not even glance at him ; but it still seemed to Dol@@ ly out of place to begin to discuss this big subject in the cal@@ è@@ che , so she briefly replied :
'@@ i don '@@ t take any view . I always loved you , and if one loves , one loves the whole person as he or she is , and not as one might wish them to be . '
Anna , turning her eyes away from her friend and scre@@ wing them up ( this was a new habit of hers and unfamiliar to Dol@@ ly ) , grew thoughtful , trying thoroughly to grasp the meaning of the remark .
'@@ If you had any sins , ' she said , ' they would all be forgiven you for coming here and for those words ! '
and Dol@@ ly noticed that tears had started to her eyes .
'@@ But what are those buildings ?
'@@ They are the employees ' houses , the stu@@ d farm , and the st@@ ables , ' answered Anna . ' and here the park begins .
everything had been neglected , but Alex@@ is has had it all renovated .
he is very fond of this estate , and - a thing I never expected of him - he is quite enthusiastic in managing the place .
but of course his is such a talented nature !
whatever he takes up , he does splen@@ di@@ dly !
he is not only not bored , but passi@@ on@@ ately eng@@ ros@@ sed in his occupations .
he has grown into a first @@@ -@@ @ rate , prudent land@@ lord , as I recognize ; in farming matters he is even st@@ ing@@ y , but only in farming .
it is the new hospital .
I think it will cost more than a hundred thousand roubles .
that is his hobby just now .
and do you know why he started it ?
the peasants asked him to let them some meadows at a reduced rent , I think , and he refused , and I repro@@ ached him with being st@@ ing@@ y .
of course it was not that alone , but one thing with another caused him to start that hospital , to show , you know , that he is not st@@ ing@@ y .
C '@@ est une peti@@ tes@@ se [ It is a pet@@ t@@ iness . ] if you like , but I love him the better for it !
'@@ How fine ! ' said Dol@@ ly , looking with involun@@ tary surprise at a handsome house with a row of columns standing out among the vari@@ ously tin@@ ted fol@@ i@@ age of the old trees in the garden .
and from up@@ stairs the view is wonderful . '
they drove into a grav@@ elled courtyard surrounded by flowers , where two men were making a border of rough por@@ ous stones round a well @@@ -@@ @ for@@ ked flower @@@ -@@ @ bed and stopped beneath a roof@@ ed por@@ tic@@ o .
'@@ ah , they 've already arrived , ' said Anna , looking at the horses that were being led away from the front door . ' Don '@@ t you think that one is a beautiful horse ?
bring it here , and get me some sugar .
where is the Count ? ' she asked the two elegant foot@@ men who had rushed out . ' Ah , there he is ! ' she went on , seeing V@@ ron@@ sky and V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky coming out to meet her .
'@@ Oh no ! that 's too far off !
well , let 's go in , ' said Anna , who had given her favourite horse the sugar the foot@@ man had brought .
Anna turned to Dol@@ ly . ' how long can you stay ?
only a day !
'@@ no , Dol@@ ly dar@@ ling ! ...
come ! come along ! ' and Anna led the way to Dol@@ ly 's room .
it was not the grand room that V@@ ron@@ sky had suggested , but one for which Anna apologi@@ zed to Dol@@ ly .
and this room needing an ap@@ ology was full of lux@@ uries , such as Dol@@ ly had never lived among , which reminded her of the best hotels abroad .
'@@ Well , de@@ arest ! how happy I am ! ' said Anna , who in her riding @@@ -@@ @ habit had sat down for a moment beside Dol@@ ly .
grown a big girl , I suppose ? '
'@@ Yes , quite big , ' answered Dol@@ ly shortly , and was herself surprised that she could talk so col@@ dly about her children . ' we are very comfortable at the Lev@@ ins ' , ' she added .
'@@ There now ! had I only known that you don '@@ t desp@@ ise me ... ' said Anna , ' you should all have come to us .
you know Steve and Alex@@ is are old and great friends , ' she added and suddenly bl@@ ushed .
'@@ Yes , but we are so comfortable ... ' answered Dol@@ ly with embarrassment .
'@@ However , my joy makes me talk nonsense !
but really , dear , I am so glad to see you , ' said Anna , kis@@ sing her again . ' you have not yet told me how and what you think about me , and I want to know everything .
but I am glad that you will see me just as I am .
above all , I don '@@ t want you to think that I wish to prove anything .
I don '@@ t want to prove anything : simply I wish to live , not hurting anyone but myself .
however , that needs a long talk , and we will talk it all well over later .
everything was new , from the new French wall @@@ -@@ @ papers to the carpet which covered the whole floor .
the bed had a spring and an over@@ lay matt@@ ress , with a specially shaped bolster and small pil@@ lows with silk sli@@ ps .
the marble wash@@ stand , the dressing @@@ -@@ @ table , the couch , the tables , the bronze clock on the man@@ tel@@ piece , the curtains and door @@@ -@@ @ hang@@ ings were all costly and new .
the smart lady 's maid with hair sty@@ lis@@ h@@ ly done , and wearing a dress more fashionable than Dol@@ ly 's , who came to offer her services , was as new and expensive as everything else in the room .
she was ashamed of the very patches and dar@@ ns on which she at home pri@@ ded herself .
at home it was clear that six jackets required twenty @@@ -@@ @ four ar@@ sh@@ ins of n@@ ain@@ s@@ ook at sixty @@@ -@@ @ five kop@@ eks , which comes to more than fifteen roubles , besides the trim@@ m@@ ings and the work ; and she had saved all that .
but before the maid she felt not exactly ashamed but uncomfortable .
the smart maid had to go to her mistress , and Ann@@ ush@@ ka remained with Dol@@ ly .
Ann@@ ush@@ ka was evidently very pleased that the lady had come , and ch@@ attered incess@@ antly .
'@@ i grew up with Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna ; she is de@@ arer to me than anything .
is it for us to judge ?
and how he seems to love ... '
'@@ Well then , have this washed if possible , ' interrupted Dol@@ ly .
'@@ Yes , ma '@@ am !
what a husband ... '
Dol@@ ly was glad when Anna came in and thereby put an end to Ann@@ ush@@ ka 's chat@@ ter .
Anna had changed into a very simple lawn dress .
Dol@@ ly looked carefully at this simple dress .
Anna was now no longer embarrassed .
she was free and at her ease .
greatly improved .
would you like to see her ?
come , I 'll show her to you ...
I 've had such trouble with the nurses , ' she began .
'@@ We had an Italian wet nurse for her .
good , but so stupid !
we wanted to send her back , but the child is so used to her that we are still keeping her . '
you wished to ask about her name ?
it troubles Alex@@ is .
she has no name .
that is , her name is K@@ aren@@ ina , ' said Anna , scre@@ wing up her eyes till only the meeting l@@ ashes could be seen . ' however , we will talk about all that later , ' said she , suddenly bri@@ ghtening .
'@@ Come ! I will show her to you .
in the nur@@ sery the luxury noticeable in the rest of the house struck Dol@@ ly still mare strongly .
here were per@@ am@@ bul@@ ators ordered from England , an apparatus to teach a baby to walk , a specially constructed piece of furniture like a billi@@ ard @@@ -@@ @ table for the baby to crawl on , swings , and baths of a new special kind .
all these were English , strongly made , of good quality , and evidently very expensive .
the room was large , very lofty and light .
when they entered the little girl was sitting in her chem@@ ise in a little arm @@@ -@@ @ chair at a table , having her dinner of bro@@ th which she was sp@@ illing all over her little chest .
a Russian nur@@ sem@@ aid was feeding the child and evidently herself eating also .
neither the wet nurse nor the head nurse were to be seen : they were in the next room , where one could hear them talking in a peculiar French , the only tongue in which they could con@@ verse .
to each word of Anna 's the Englis@@ h@@ woman quickly repeated , ' Yes , my lady ! ' several times .
the way the little girl craw@@ led also greatly pleased Dol@@ ly .
not one of her children had craw@@ led like that .
the baby looked wonder@@ fully sweet when she was put down on the carpet , with her little fro@@ ck t@@ ucked up behind .
but Dol@@ ly did not at all like the general atmosphere of that nur@@ sery , especially the English nurse .
Anna wished to get the baby her toy and could not find it .
but the most astonishing thing was that when asked how many teeth the baby had , Anna made a mistake and knew nothing of the two latest teeth .
'@@ i feel it hard sometimes that I am as it were super@@ flu@@ ous here , ' said Anna on leaving the nur@@ sery , lifting her train to avoid the toys that lay beside the door . ' it was quite different with the first one . '
you know I have seen him , Ser@@ ez@@ ha , ' said Anna , scre@@ wing up her eyes as if pe@@ ering at something far off . ' however , we will talk about that afterwards .
would you believe it , I am just like a starving woman to whom a full meal has been served , and who does not know what to begin on first ?
the full meal is you and the talks I am going to have with you , and which I could not have with anyone else , and I don '@@ t know on what to begin first !
I must speak out about everything . yes , I must give you a sketch of the people you will meet here , ' she began .
you know her , and I know your and Steve 's opinion of her .
Steve says the one aim of her life is to prove her superiority to A@@ unt Catherine Pavlov@@ na . that is quite true ; but she is kind , and I am very grateful to her .
there was a moment in Petersburg when I needed a cha@@ per@@ on .
just then she turned up .
I see you do not realize all the difficulty of my position ... there in Petersburg , ' she added . ' here I am quite tran@@ qui@@ l and happy ; but about that later on .
then there 's S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky : he is a Mar@@ sh@@ al of Nob@@ ility and a very decent fellow , but he wants something from Alex@@ is .
you see , with his means , now that we have settled in the country , Alex@@ is can have great influence .
then there is T@@ ush@@ kevich : you have met him , he was always with Bet@@ sy .
now he has been de@@ posed and has come to us .
as Alex@@ is says he is one of those men who are very agre@@ eable if one takes them for what they wish to appear , et pu@@ is , il est comm@@ e il f@@ aut , [ And then , he is good form . ] as the Princess Barbara says .
then there 's V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky ... you know him .
he is a nice boy , ' she said , and a ro@@ gu@@ ish smile p@@ uck@@ ered her lips . ' what outrageous affair was that with Levin ?
V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky told Alex@@ is , and we simply can '@@ t believe it .
Il est tr@@ è@@ s g@@ enti@@ l et naï@@ f , ' [ He is very nice and naive . ] she added with the same smile . ' men need distraction , and Alex@@ is needs an audience ; so I value all this company .
things must be lively and am@@ using here , so that Alex@@ is shall not wish for anything new !
Alex@@ is thinks highly of him .
then there 's the doctor , a young man , not exactly a nihil@@ ist , but - you know , eats with his knife ... but a very good doctor .
'@@ Her husband will give her a divorce , and then I shall go back to my sol@@ itude ; but at present I can be of use and I fulfil my duty , however hard it may be , not like others ...
and how kind you are , and how well you have done to come !
they live like the best of married couples . it is for God to judge them , not for us .
think of Bir@@ yu@@ z@@ ovsky and A@@ ven@@ yeva ...
and even Nik@@ and@@ rov ! and how about Vas@@ ilev with Mam@@ an@@ ova , and Lisa Nep@@ tu@@ nova ... ?
no one said anything against them ?
and in the end they were all received again ...
dinner is at seven . Steve did very well to send you .
he must keep in with them .
you know , through his mother and brother he can do anything .
and then they do much good .
their conversation was interrupted by Anna , who had found the men in the billi@@ ard @@@ -@@ @ room and brought them back with her to the ver@@ and@@ ah .
as there was still plenty of time before dinner , and the weather was beautiful , several different ways of passing the next two hours were proposed .
there were a great many ways of spending time at Vo@@ z@@ d@@ vi@@ zhen@@ sk , all differing from those at Pok@@ rovsk .
'@@ une parti@@ e de [ A game of . ] lawn tennis , ' suggested V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky with his pleasing smile . ' we will be partners again , Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna ! '
'@@ no , it 's too hot : better let 's walk through the garden and go for a row , to let Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na see the banks , ' suggested V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ i will agree to anything , ' said S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky .
'@@ i think Dol@@ ly will find a walk the pleas@@ ant@@ est , won '@@ t you ?
and then we can go in the boat , ' said Anna .
all agreed to this .
two couples - Anna with S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky and Dol@@ ly with V@@ ron@@ sky walked down a garden path .
Dol@@ ly was somewhat embarrassed and troubled by the quite novel circle she found herself in .
in the abstract , theoretically , she not only exc@@ used but even approved of Anna 's action .
as is frequently the case with irre@@ pro@@ ach@@ ably moral women who become tired of the mon@@ ot@@ ony of a moral life , she from a distance not only exc@@ used a guilty love but even envi@@ ed it .
besides , she loved Anna from her heart .
but actually seeing her among these people so alien to herself , with their fashionable tone which was quite new to her , Dol@@ ly felt ill at ease .
in particular it was dis@@ agre@@ eable to her to see the Princess Barbara , who for@@ gave them everything for the sake of the comforts she enjoyed there .
in general , in the abstract Dol@@ ly approved the step Anna had taken , but it was unpleasant to her to see the man for whose sake the step had been taken .
besides , she had never liked V@@ ron@@ sky .
she considered him very proud , and saw nothing in him to justify that pride ; except his wealth .
but involun@@ tarily he , here in his own house , imposed on her more than ever , and she could not feel at ease with him .
she experienced the same kind of sh@@ y@@ ness in his presence that she had felt when the lady 's maid saw her jacket .
as with the maid she felt not exactly ashamed but uncomfortable about the patches , so with him she felt not exactly ashamed but ill @@@ -@@ @ at @@@ -@@ @ ease about herself .
'@@ Yes , it is a very handsome building and in a good old style , ' he said .
'@@ i like the courtyard in front of the por@@ tic@@ o very much .
'@@ Oh no ! ' he replied , and his face lit up with pleasure . ' if you had only seen that courtyard in spring ! '
and he began , at first with reserve but more and more carried away by his subject , to draw her attention to various details of the ador@@ n@@ ment of the house and garden .
one could see that , having devoted great pains to the improvement and decoration of his place , V@@ ron@@ sky felt compelled to boast of them to a fresh person , and was hear@@ tily pleased by Dol@@ ly 's pra@@ ises .
'@@ If you care to see the hospital and are not too tired - it is not far .
shall we go ? ' he suggested , gl@@ ancing at her face to assure himself that she really was not bored .
'@@ Will you come , Anna ? ' he said , turning to her .
yes , it is a monument he is er@@ ecting here , ' said Anna to Dol@@ ly , with the same sly knowing smile with which she had previously spoken about the hospital .
'@@ Oh , it 's a great undertaking ! ' said S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky .
'@@ C '@@ est dev@@ en@@ u tell@@ ement comm@@ un , les é@@ col@@ es , ' [ Scho@@ ols have become so common . ] answered V@@ ron@@ sky . ' of course that 's not the reason , but I ...
the ladies opened their sun@@ shades and entered the side@@ walk .
after several tur@@ nings they passed through a gate , and Dol@@ ly saw on the high ground before her a large , red , nearly completed building of a f@@ anci@@ ful shape .
the still un@@ painted iron roof shone dazz@@ l@@ ingly in the sunshine .
beside the finished building another as yet surrounded by sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding was being built . work@@ men wearing ap@@ rons stood on the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding laying bricks , pouring water from wooden p@@ ails , or smoo@@ thing the mortar .
'@@ How quickly your work gets on ! ' said S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky . ' when I was last here there was no roof . '
'@@ And what is this new building ? '
'@@ That will be the doctor 's quarters and the dispens@@ ary , ' replied V@@ ron@@ sky ; and seeing the architect in his short jacket coming toward them , he apologi@@ zed to the ladies and went to meet him .
avoiding the pit from which the men were taking mortar , he stopped and began he@@ at@@ edly discussing something with the architect .
'@@ the pedi@@ ment is still too low , ' he answered Anna 's question as to what it was all about .
'@@ i said the foundations ought to be raised , ' said Anna .
'@@ Yes , of course that would have been better , Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna , ' replied the architect , ' but it 's done now . '
having finished talking with the architect V@@ ron@@ sky re@@ joined the ladies and led them to the hospital .
although they were still working at the cor@@ n@@ ices outside and painting inside on the ground floor , the upper story was nearly finished .
asc@@ ending the broad cast @@@ -@@ @ iron staircase to the landing , they entered the first large room .
'@@ This is the waiting @@@ -@@ @ room , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky . ' there will be a desk , a table and a cu@@ pboard here : nothing more . '
'@@ This way ! we will pass here .
Don '@@ t go near the window ! ' said Anna , feeling whether the paint was dry . ' Alex@@ is , the paint is dry already , ' she added .
then he showed the marble baths and the beds with peculiar spring matt@@ resses .
S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky appreciated everything like one who is acquainted with all the newest improvements .
Dol@@ ly was simply surprised at what she had never before seen , and wishing to understand it all , asked for information about every detail , which evidently grati@@ fied V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ Yes , I think this will be the only quite correctly planned hospital in Russia , ' said S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky .
'@@ And will you have a maternity ward ? ' inqui@@ red Dol@@ ly . ' that is so much wanted in the country .
I often ... '
despite his courtesy , V@@ ron@@ sky interrupted her .
everything interested Dol@@ ly and everything pleased her , especially V@@ ron@@ sky himself with his natural and naive enthusiasm .
'@@ Yes , he is a very nice , good fellow , ' she thought again and again , not listening to him but looking at him , understanding his expression , and mentally putting herself in Anna 's place .
in this animated state she liked him so much that she understood Anna 's being able to fall in love with him .
'@@ i don '@@ t understand anything about horses , and shall be very pleased to , ' answered Dol@@ ly , taken rather by surprise .
she saw by V@@ ron@@ sky 's face that he wanted something of her .
she was not mistaken .
as soon as they had passed through the gate back into the garden , he glanced in the direction Anna had taken , and having assured himself that she could not hear or see them , he began .
Dol@@ ly did not reply and only looked at him with alarm .
alone with him she suddenly felt frightened : his laughing eyes and stern expression scared her .
or maybe it 's about Vas@@ enka V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky and his relations with Anna ?
or possibly about Kit@@ ty , and that he feels guilty toward her ? '
everything she sur@@ mis@@ ed was unpleasant , but she did not hit on what he actually wished to speak about .
have I understood you rightly ? ' he asked , turning toward her .
'@@ Oh , yes ! ' answered Dol@@ ly , closing her sun@@ shade , ' but ... '
I am the cause of that position and therefore I feel it . '
'@@ in Society it is hell ! ' he said quickly with a dark fro@@ wn . ' it is impossible to imagine greater moral tor@@ ments than those she endured for two weeks in Petersburg ... I beg you to believe me ! '
'@@ Yes , but here , so long as neither Anna nor you ... feel that you need Society ... '
'@@ Society ! ' he exclaimed with contempt . ' what need can I have of Society ? '
'@@ T@@ ill then , and that may be always , you are happy and tran@@ qui@@ l .
I see that Anna is happy , quite happy , she has already told me so , ' said Dol@@ ly smiling ; and involun@@ tarily while saying it she doubted whether Anna was really happy .
but V@@ ron@@ sky , it seemed , did not doubt it .
I am afraid of what is before us ... I beg your pardon !
he stood before her .
'@@ i see she is happy , ' he repeated , and the doubt as to whether Anna was really happy struck Dol@@ ly yet more strongly . ' but can it continue ?
whether we acted rightly or wrong@@ ly is another question ; the die is cast , ' he said , changing from Russian into French , ' and we are bound together for life .
we have a child , we may have other children .
yet the law and the circumstances of our position are such that thousands of complications appear which at present , while resting after all her sufferings and trials , she neither sees nor wishes to see .
that is natural .
I hate this false@@ hood ! ' he said with an energetic gesture of denial , and looked at Dol@@ ly with a glo@@ om@@ ily questioning expression .
imagine the hardship and horror of this situation !
I have tried to speak to Anna about it , but it irrit@@ ates her .
she does not understand and I C@@ AN@@ NOT speak out about it to her .
now look at the other side of it .
I am happy , happy in her love , but I need an occupation .
I have found one . I am proud of it , and consider it more hon@@ our@@ able than the occupations of my former comrades at Court or in the Service .
I certainly would not exchange my work for theirs .
I am working here , remaining on the spot , and I am happy and cont@@ ented , and we need nothing more for our happiness .
I like my activities .
imagine the situation of a man who knows in advance that children born of him and of the woman he loves will not be his , but some one else 's - some one who will hate them and will have nothing to do with them !
he paused , evidently greatly excited .
'@@ Yes , of course , I quite understand .
but what can Anna do ? ' asked Dol@@ ly .
'@@ Well , this brings me to the point of my talk , ' he went on , cal@@ ming himself with an effort . ' Anna can do it ; . it depends on her ...
even to be able to petition the Emperor for permission to adopt the child , a divorce will be necessary , and that depends on Anna .
it is only necessary to write to him .
he knows what torture every recoll@@ ection of him causes her , and knowing her he still demands a letter from her .
I understand that it is painful for her , but the reasons are so important that one must pass@@ er par@@ des@@ sus t@@ out@@ es ces fin@@ esses de sentiment .
help me to persuade her to write to him and demand a divorce ! '
'@@ Yes , certainly , ' said Dol@@ ly though@@ tfully , vivi@@ dly remembering her last conversation with K@@ aren@@ in . ' yes certainly , ' she repeated resolutely , remembering Anna .
'@@ Use your influence with her , get her to write , I don '@@ t wish and am almost unable to speak to her about it . '
'@@ Very well , I will speak to her .
but how is it she herself does not think of it ? ' asked Dol@@ ly , suddenly remembering that strange new habit Anna had of scre@@ wing up her eyes .
and she remembered that it was just when the intimate side of life was in question that Anna scre@@ wed up her eyes .
'@@ as if she were bl@@ inking at her life so as not to see it all , ' thought Dol@@ ly . ' certainly I will speak to her , for my own sake and for hers , ' she said in reply to his expression of gratitude .
finding Dol@@ ly AL@@ RE@@ AD@@ Y returned , Anna looked attentively into her eyes as if asking about the talk she had had with V@@ ron@@ sky , but she did not ask in words .
'@@ i think it 's nearly dinner @@@ -@@ @ time , ' she said . ' we have not yet seen anything of one another ...
I am counting on this evening .
now I must go and dress , and you too , I suppose .
Dol@@ ly went to her room , feeling am@@ used .
'@@ This is all I was able to do , ' she smil@@ ingly said to Anna , who came to her in a third dress , again extremely simple .
'@@ Yes , we are very formal here , ' Anna remarked , as if exc@@ using her own smart@@ ness . ' Alex@@ is is seldom so pleased about anything as he is at your having come .
he is deci@@ dedly in love with you , ' she added . ' but are@@ n '@@ t you tired ? '
there was no time to discuss anything before dinner .
when they entered the drawing room the Princess Barbara and the men were already there .
V@@ ron@@ sky introduced the doctor and the ste@@ ward to his visitor ; the architect had already been presented at the hospital .
the fat but@@ ler - his round , clean @@@ -@@ @ sha@@ ven face and star@@ ched white tie shining - announced dinner .
the ladies rose ; V@@ ron@@ sky asked S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky to take in Anna , and himself went up to Dol@@ ly .
it was evident that it depended no more on Anna than on V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky .
Anna , S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky , the Princess , and V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky were all equally guests , g@@ aily making use of what was provided for them .
Anna was the host@@ ess only in what concerned the conversation .
reference was made to T@@ ush@@ kevich and V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky having been for a row by themselves , and T@@ ush@@ kevich began to tell about the last boat races at the Petersburg Y@@ ach@@ t Club .
but at the first pause Anna turned to the architect , to draw him into the conversation .
'@@ American methods ! ' said S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky with a smile .
'@@ Yes . there they erect buildings rationally ... '
the conversation passed on to the abuses in the government of the United States , but Anna quickly turned it to another theme so as to draw the ste@@ ward out of his silence .
'@@ Have you ever seen a re@@ aping machine ? ' she asked Dol@@ ly . ' we had been to look at them when we met you .
'@@ How do they act ? ' asked Dol@@ ly .
'@@ Just like sc@@ iss@@ ors .
like this ... '
Anna took a knife and a for@@ k in her beautiful white hands , sparkling with rings , and began to demonstrate .
'@@ R@@ ather like pen@@ kni@@ ves ! ' said V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky play@@ fully , never taking his eyes from her .
Anna smiled slightly , but did not answer him .
'@@ is it not true , Karl Fed@@ or@@ ich , that it is like sc@@ iss@@ ors ? she asked , turning to the ste@@ ward .
I saw one at the Vienna Exhibition that bound the she@@ aves with wire , ' remarked S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky . ' that kind would be more profitable , '
'@@ i had been there , but had evapor@@ ated , ' said the doctor , with dismal j@@ oc@@ ularity .
'@@ Then you have had some good exercise ? '
'@@ Mag@@ nific@@ ent ! '
'@@ What a pity ! ' said Anna , and having thus paid the tribute of polit@@ eness to the ret@@ ain@@ ers , she turned to her friends .
'@@ all the same , it would be difficult to construct a re@@ aper from your description , Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna , ' S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky cha@@ ffed her .
'@@ Oh , why not ? ' said Anna , with a smile which said that she knew there had been something engaging in her way of describing the re@@ aper and that S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky had noticed it .
'@@ But then , Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna 's knowledge of architecture is wonderful , ' remarked T@@ ush@@ kevich .
'@@ Oh , yes ! yesterday I heard Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna mention damp courses and pl@@ in@@ ths , ' said V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky . ' am I saying it right ? '
'@@ There 's nothing to be surprised at , considering how much I hear and see of it , ' said Anna . ' and you , I 'm sure , don '@@ t even know what houses are made of ! '
Dol@@ ly noticed that Anna did not like the play@@ ful tone that had arisen between herself and V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky , yet could not help falling in with it .
V@@ ron@@ sky behaved in this matter quite unlike Levin .
he evidently did not attach any importance to V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky 's chat@@ ter , and even encouraged it .
'@@ Come , V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky ! tell us what keeps the bricks together ! '
'@@ C@@ ement , of course ! '
'@@ Bra@@ vo !
'@@ Well ... it 's something like paste ... no , put@@ ty ! ' replied V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky , r@@ ousing general laughter .
the conversation among the din@@ ers - except the doctor , the architect and the ste@@ ward , who sat in gloomy silence - was incess@@ ant , now gli@@ ding smoothly , now catching on something and touching one or other of them to the quick .
once Dol@@ ly was stun@@ g to the quick ; and so aroused that she even fl@@ ushed up , and afterwards wondered whether she had said anything super@@ flu@@ ous and dis@@ agre@@ eable .
S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky began talking about Levin and mentioned his peculiar view that machines only did harm in Russian agriculture .
and what opinions are possible on so plain a matter ? '
'@@ Turkish opinions , ' said V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky , turning to Anna with a smile .
'@@ That is our Russian indifference , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , pouring water from an iced dec@@ an@@ ter into a very thin glass with a stem , ' not to realize the duties our rights impose on us , and therefore to deny those duties . '
'@@ i know no one who fulfil@@ s his duties more strictly , ' said Dol@@ ly , irrit@@ ated by V@@ ron@@ sky 's superior tone .
I consider that the duty of going to the meetings , and considering a peasant 's case about a horse , is as important as anything else I can do .
I shall consider it an honour if they elect me to the Zem@@ st@@ vo .
it is only so that I can make a return for the advantages I enjoy as a land@@ owner .
unfortunately people do not understand the importance the large land@@ owners should have in the State . '
to Dol@@ ly it sounded strange to hear how assured he was of being in the right , here at his own table .
she remembered how Levin , who held the opposite opinion , was equally positive in his opinions at his own table .
but she was fond of Levin , and therefore sided with him .
'@@ Then we may expect to see you at the next Session , Count ? ' asked S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky . ' but you must come in good time , so as to be there on the eighth .
if you would only do me the honour of stopping with me ... '
formerly we used to have so many officials that there had to be an official for everything that was done , and now we have public workers for everything !
and I fear that with the multipl@@ ication of these positions they become a mere form .
of how many institutions are you a member , Nicholas Ivan@@ ich ? ' she asked , addressing S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky ; ' more than twenty , is@@ n '@@ t it ? '
although Anna spoke play@@ fully , irritation was percep@@ tible in her tone .
Dol@@ ly , who was attentively watching her and V@@ ron@@ sky , noticed it at once .
she also saw that at this conversation V@@ ron@@ sky 's face immediately assumed a serious and obst@@ inate expression .
then they played lawn @@@ -@@ @ tennis .
the players , having chosen their partners , took their places on the carefully lev@@ elled and rolled cro@@ quet lawn , on the two sides of a net stretched between two small gil@@ ded pillars .
Dol@@ ly tried to play , but was long unable to understand the game , and by the time she did understand it she was so tired that she sat down beside the Princess Barbara to watch the others .
her partner T@@ ush@@ kevich also gave it up , but the rest played for a long time .
S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky and V@@ ron@@ sky both played very well and seriously .
V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky played worse than the others .
he , as well as the other men , had with the ladies ' permission taken off his coat , and his large handsome figure in white shirt @@@ -@@ @ sle@@ eves , his rud@@ dy per@@ spir@@ ing face and impet@@ uous movements , stamped themselves on the memories of the on@@ loo@@ kers .
as soon as Dol@@ ly that night had gone to bed and closed her eyes , she saw Vas@@ enka V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky rushing hi@@ ther and thi@@ ther on the cro@@ quet lawn .
while they were playing Dol@@ ly was not feeling happy .
she did not like the ban@@ tering tone between Anna and V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky that continued during the game , nor the un@@ natur@@ al@@ ness of grown @@@ -@@ @ up people when they play chil@@ dish games in the absence of children .
but not to disturb the others and to while away the time , after resting she re@@ joined the players and pre@@ tended to like it .
all that day she felt as if she were acting in a theatre with better actors than herself , and that her bad performance was spo@@ iling the whole affair .
but that evening during the game she resolved to leave next day .
those painful maternal worries , which she had so hated on her journey , now after a day spent without them appeared in quite a different light and drew her back to them .
when , after evening tea and a row in the boat at night @@@ -@@ @ time , Dol@@ ly entered her bedroom alone , took off her dress and sat down to do up her thin hair for the night , she felt great relief .
even the thought that Anna would come in a moment was dis@@ agre@@ eable to her .
she wished to be alone with her thoughts .
Dol@@ ly W@@ AS RE@@ AD@@ Y TO GE@@ T IN@@ TO bed when Anna in her night@@ g@@ own came into the room .
several times during the day Anna had begun to talk about intimate matters , but after a few words she had always paused , saying : ' later on when we are alone we will talk it all over .
I have so much to say to you ! '
now they were alone , but Anna did not know what to speak about .
she sat by the window , looking at Dol@@ ly and mentally reviewing all those stores of intimate topics that had seemed in@@ exha@@ ustible , and could find nothing to say .
it seemed to her at that moment as if everything had already been said .
'@@ An@@ gry ?
no ! ' replied Dol@@ ly with a smile .
but you know one does not forgive those things ! '
'@@ no , no , ' said Anna , turning away and looking out of the open window . ' but it was not my fault , and whose fault was it ?
could things have been different ?
could it have happened to you not to be Steve 's wife ? '
but I want you to tell me this ... '
I am very glad !
it is not enough to say he 's a fine fellow , ' she repeated .
Dol@@ ly smiled .
'@@ But tell me about yourself .
'@@ With Alex@@ is ? ' said Anna . ' I know you have .
but I want to ask you frankly , what do you think of me and of my life ? '
'@@ Oh , but all the same , tell me ! ...
you see what my life is .
but don '@@ t forget that you see us in summer when you have come and we are not alone ...
but we came here in early spring and lived quite alone , and we shall live alone again . I don '@@ t wish for anything better .
one day there are races and his horses are running ; he goes .
but think of me , imagine my position ... But why talk of it ! '
she smiled . ' well then , what did he talk about to you ? '
but all the same if it is possible you should get married . '
'@@ That is , get a divorce ? ' said Anna . ' do you know , the only woman who called on me in Petersburg was Bet@@ sy T@@ ver@@ skaya ?
[ at bottom , she 's the most de@@ pra@@ ved woman in existence . ]
Don '@@ t think I am making any comparison ...
but I could not help remembering ...
perhaps you will say it is ego@@ tism , but what legitimate and noble ego@@ tism !
he wants , first of all , to legitim@@ ati@@ ze his daughter and to be your husband and have a right to you . '
'@@ What wife , what slave could be such a slave as I am in my position ? ' Anna sul@@ len@@ ly interrupted her .
'@@ But the chief thing he wants is that you should not suffer . '
'@@ And his most legitimate wish is that your children should not be nam@@ eless . '
'@@ What children ? ' said Anna , scre@@ wing up her eyes and not looking at Dol@@ ly .
'@@ He may be at ease about that : I shall not have any more children . '
'@@ How do you know you won '@@ t ? '
'@@ i Sh@@ an '@@ t , because I don '@@ t want them . '
and in spite of her agitation Anna smiled on noticing the naive expression of curiosity , surprise and terror on Dol@@ ly 's face .
'@@ Im@@ possible ! said Dol@@ ly , with wide @@@ -@@ @ open eyes .
it was the very thing she had dream@@ t of , but now on learning that it was possible , she was horri@@ fied .
she felt that it was too simple a solution of too complex a question .
'@@ Why ?
remember I have to choose between two things : either to become pregnant , that is ill , or to be the friend and com@@ rade of my husband - for he is my husband all the same , ' said Anna , in a tone of intentional lev@@ ity .
'@@ Well , yes , of course , ' said Dol@@ ly , listening to the very arguments which she had put to herself but not finding them so convincing as before .
'@@ For you and for others , ' said Anna , as if gu@@ essing her thoughts , ' there may still be some doubt , but for me ...
remember , I am not a wife , he loves me as long as his love lasts !
well , how am I to keep his love ?
with unusual rap@@ idity , as happens at times of great agitation , thoughts and recoll@@ ections crowded into Dol@@ ly 's mind .
he threw her over and took another .
is it possible that Anna will attract and keep Count V@@ ron@@ sky in this way ?
if he looks for that sort of thing he will find women whose dresses and manners are still brighter and more attractive .
Dol@@ ly made no answer and only sigh@@ ed .
Anna noticed the sigh , which expressed dissent , and continued .
she had other arguments in store , and such powerful ones that they could not be answered .
'@@ You say it is not right ?
but you must consider , ' she went on . ' you forget my position .
how can I desire children ?
I am not talking of the suffering : I am not afraid of that .
but think who my children would be !
unfortunate beings , who would have to bear a stranger 's name !
by the very fact of their birth they would have to be ashamed of their mother , their father , their birth ! '
'@@ But that 's just why a divorce is necessary ! '
she wanted to reproduce the arguments with which she had so often convinced herself .
'@@ What was my reason given me for , if I am not to use it to avoid bringing unfortunate beings into the world ? '
'@@ i should always feel guilty toward those unhappy children , ' said she . ' if they don '@@ t exist at any rate they are not unhappy , but if they are unhappy I alone shall be to blame . '
these were the very arguments Dol@@ ly had put to herself , but now she listened without understanding them .
'@@ How can one be guilty toward beings who don '@@ t exist ? ' thought she .
and suddenly the question came into her mind , whether it could be better in any case for her favourite G@@ ris@@ ha if he had never existed ?
this appeared to her so monstr@@ ous and strange that she shook her head , to dis@@ pel the confusion of insane thoughts that whir@@ led in her brain .
'@@ Well , I don '@@ t know ; but it is not right , ' she said with a look of dis@@ gust .
'@@ Yes , but don '@@ t forget what you are and what I am ...
the question for you is , whether you desire not to have any more children ; for me it is , whether I desire to have them .
and that is a great difference .
Don '@@ t you see that , situated as I am , I C@@ AN@@ NOT desire them ? '
she suddenly felt that she was so far away from Anna that there were questions on which they could never meet , and about which it was best not to talk .
'@@ TH@@ EN TH@@ ERE IS ALL THE M@@ ORE NE@@ ED to regul@@ arize your position if possible , ' said Dol@@ ly .
'@@ Yes , if possible , ' Anna said , in what had suddenly become quite a different - a quiet and sad - voice .
I was told your husband had agreed ... '
'@@ Dol@@ ly , I don '@@ t want to speak about it ! '
'@@ Well then , we won '@@ t , ' Dol@@ ly ha@@ st@@ ened to say , noticing the look of pain on Anna 's face . ' but I see that you look at things too dis@@ m@@ ally . '
I am very cheerful and satisfied .
'@@ Yes , to tell you the truth , I don '@@ t like V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky 's manner , ' said Dol@@ ly , wishing to change the subject .
'@@ Oh , not at all !
it tic@@ k@@ les Alex@@ is , and that 's all ; he is only a boy and entirely in my hands ; you know , I manage him just as I please .
Dol@@ ly ! ' she said suddenly , changing her tone , ' you say I look at things too dis@@ m@@ ally ; you C@@ AN@@ NOT understand .
it is too dreadful .
'@@ But I think you ought to .
you must do all that is possible . '
nothing !
you say I must marry Alex@@ is , and that I don '@@ t consider that .
I not consider that ! ' she repeated , and fl@@ ushed .
she rose , drew herself up , sigh@@ ed deeply , and with her light steps began pac@@ ing up and down the room , pa@@ using occasionally . ' I not consider it ?
not a day , not an hour passes without my thinking about it and blaming myself for what I think ... because those thoughts are enough to drive one mad !
to drive one mad ! ' she repeated . ' when I think of it I C@@ AN@@ NOT fall asleep without mor@@ phia .
let us discuss it quietly .
they speak of divorce .
for one thing , he would not agree now .
Dol@@ ly , sitting upright in her chair , with a p@@ ained expression of sympathy turned her head to follow Anna 's movements .
'@@ One must try , ' she said gently .
'@@ Let 's grant that .
sup@@ posing I get his consent ... '
Anna at that instant had reached the other end of the room and stopped there , doing something to the window curtain .
'@@ i receive his consent , and my so ... son ?
they will not give him to me .
he will grow up desp@@ ising me , in the house of his father whom I have left .
understand that I love equally , I think , and both more than myself - two beings : Ser@@ ez@@ ha and Alex@@ is . '
in her white dressing @@@ -@@ @ g@@ own her figure appeared peculi@@ arly tall and broad .
'@@ i love those two beings only , and the one excludes the other !
I C@@ AN@@ NOT unite them , yet that is the one thing I desire .
and if I can '@@ t have that , nothing matters - nothing , nothing !
it will end somehow , therefore I can '@@ t - I don '@@ t like speaking about it .
so don '@@ t repro@@ ach me , don '@@ t condemn me for anything !
you in your purity C@@ AN@@ NOT understand all I suffer ! '
she came and sat down beside Dol@@ ly , pe@@ ering into her face with a guilty look , and took her by the hand .
'@@ What are you thinking ?
what are you thinking of me ?
if anyone is unhappy , it is I ! ' she mur@@ mu@@ red , and , turning away , she we@@ pt .
left alone , Dol@@ ly said her prayers and got into bed .
she had p@@ iti@@ ed Anna from the bottom of her heart while they were talking ; but now she could not make herself think about her .
recoll@@ ections of home and of her children rose in her imagination with a new and peculiar charm .
that world of her own now seemed so precious and dear that she did not wish on any account to spend another day away from it , and she decided certainly to go home on the mor@@ row .
when she came in V@@ ron@@ sky regarded her attentively .
he tried to find some trace of the conversation which he knew , by her having remained so long in Dol@@ ly 's room , must have taken place .
he did not wish to ask her what they had been talking about , but hoped that she would tell him of her own accord .
however , she only said :
'@@ i am glad you like Dol@@ ly .
but all the same I was very glad she came . '
he took Anna 's hand and looked inqu@@ ir@@ ingly into her eyes .
she , misunderstanding that look , smiled at him .
next morning , in spite of her hosts ' entre@@ aties , Dol@@ ly prepared to go home .
taking leave of the Princess Barbara and of the men was unpleasant to Dol@@ ly .
after spending a day together both she and her host felt distinctly that they did not suit one another and that it was better for them not to associate .
only Anna felt sad .
she knew that when Dol@@ ly was gone no one would call up in her soul the feelings which had been aroused by their meeting .
to have those feelings awakened was painful , but still she knew that they were the best part of her soul , and that that part of her was rapidly being cho@@ ked by the life she was leading .
when they had driven into the fields Dol@@ ly experienced a pleasant feeling of relief , and she was about to ask the men how they had liked the V@@ ron@@ sk@@ ys ' place , when suddenly Philip the co@@ ach@@ man himself remarked :
'@@ They 're rich , that they are , but yet they gave us only two bus@@ hel@@ s of o@@ ats .
what 's two bus@@ hel@@ s ? only a bite .
nowadays o@@ ats are forty @@@ -@@ @ five kop@@ eks at the in@@ ns .
'a st@@ ing@@ y gentleman ... ' confirmed the cler@@ k .
'@@ Well , and did you like their horses ? ' asked Dol@@ ly .
but it did seem so dull to me , Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na ! I don '@@ t know how you found it , ' he added , turning his handsome , kindly face toward her .
well , shall we get back by evening ? '
'@@ We ought to . '
V@@ ron@@ sky AND AN@@ NA W@@ ENT ON L@@ IV@@ ING IN THE CO@@ UN@@ TR@@ Y in the same way , still taking no steps to obtain a divorce , all the summer and part of the autumn .
their life seemed one that could not be improved upon : they had ample means , good health , a child , and both had occupations of their own .
in the absence of visitors Anna still continued to devote attention to her person , and read a great deal - both novels and such serious books as were in fashion .
she ordered all the books that were praised in the foreign newspapers and magazines they received , and read them with the attention one gives only to what one reads in sol@@ itude .
she studied also from books and from technical papers all the subjects with which V@@ ron@@ sky was occupied , so that he often came straight to her with questions about agriculture , architecture , and sometimes even horse@@ breeding or sport .
he was ast@@ ounded at her knowledge and memory , and at first used to doubt her information and want it confirmed . she would then find what he wanted in books and show it him .
the arrangement of the hospital also interested her .
there she not only helped , but arranged and planned many things herself .
nevertheless , her chief pre@@ occupation was still herself - herself in so far as V@@ ron@@ sky held her dear and in so far as she could compensate him for all he had given up .
V@@ ron@@ sky appreciated this , which had become the sole aim of her life , a desire not only to please him but also to serve him ; but at the same time he was troubled by these love @@@ -@@ @ mes@@ hes in which she tried to ent@@ angle him .
as time went on , the of@@ ten@@ er he felt himself caught in these mes@@ hes the more he desired , not exactly to escape from them but to try whether they really interfer@@ ed with his freedom .
had it not been for this ever @@@ -@@ @ increasing desire for freedom - not to have a scene each time he had to go to town to a meeting or to the races - V@@ ron@@ sky would have been quite content with his life .
his affairs , which occupied and absorbed him more and more , progressed excell@@ ently .
in spite of the tremendous sums the hospital , the machinery , the cows which he imported from Switzerland , and many other things were costing him , he was sure that he was not wasting his substance but increasing it .
where it was a question of income - the sale of forest land , of corn or wool , or the leasing of land - V@@ ron@@ sky was as hard as fl@@ int and could hold out for his price .
in all operations on a large scale , both on this and on his other estates , he kept to the simplest and saf@@ est methods , and was extremely economical and careful in his expenditure on small details .
he listened to what the ste@@ ward had to say and questioned him , but only con@@ s@@ ented when the things to be ordered or built were the latest , as yet unknown in Russia , and likely to aston@@ ish people .
besides , he decided on a big out@@ lay only when he had money to spare , and when spending he went into every detail and insisted on getting the very best for his money .
so that from the way he managed his business it was clear that he was not wasting but increasing his property .
in October there were the Nob@@ ility elections in the Kash@@ in Province , in which V@@ ron@@ sky 's , S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky 's , Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev 's , and also a small part of Levin 's estates were situated .
various circumstances , as well as the men who took part in them , caused these elections to attract public attention .
they were much discussed and preparations were made for them .
people living in Moscow and Petersburg as well as others from abroad , who had never come to any elections , assembled at these .
V@@ ron@@ sky had long ago promised S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky to be present .
before the elections S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky , who often visited at Vo@@ z@@ d@@ vi@@ zhen@@ sk , called for V@@ ron@@ sky .
the day before , V@@ ron@@ sky and Anna had almost quar@@ rel@@ led about his proposed journey .
but , to his surprise , Anna took the news very quietly and only asked when he would return .
he looked at her attentively , not understanding this calm manner .
he knew her capacity for withdrawing into herself , and knew that she only did it when she had come to some resolution in her own mind without telling him of her plans .
he feared this , but he so wished to avoid a scene that he pre@@ tended to believe , and to some extent sincerely believed , in what he wished to believe , namely , in her reason@@ abl@@ eness .
'@@ i hope you won '@@ t be dull ? '
no , I Sh@@ an '@@ t be dull . '
'@@ She means to adopt this tone - well , so much the better ! ' thought he , ' or else it would be the usual thing again . '
and so , without challenging her to a frank explanation , he left for the elections .
it was the first time since their union that he had parted from her without a full explanation .
on the one hand this fact disturbed him , but on the other hand it seemed the best way .
'@@ at first there will be , as now , something uncertain , something concealed ; but afterwards she will get used to it .
in any case I can give her everything else , but not my independence as a man , ' he reflected .
in September Levin moved to Moscow for Kit@@ ty 's confin@@ ement .
he had already been living there a whole month without occupation , when Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , who had an estate in the Kash@@ in Province and took a great interest in the forthcoming elections , prepared to attend them .
he asked his brother , who had a vote for the Sel@@ ez@@ nev district , to accompany him .
Levin was still waver@@ ing , but Kit@@ ty , who had noticed that he was dull in Moscow and had advised him to go , without saying anything to him ordered for him the uniform necessary for the occasion , which cost eighty roubles .
and it was these eighty roubles paid for the uniform which chiefly decided him .
so he went to Kash@@ in .
Levin had been five days in Kash@@ in , going daily to meetings and taking a great deal of trouble over his sister 's business , which he was still unable to arrange .
the Mar@@ sh@@ als of the Nob@@ ility were all busy with the elections , and he could not get even the simple matter in connection with the wardship settled .
the other business , that of getting the money paid , also met with obstacles .
he felt this frequently when talking to his very good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured legal adviser .
this legal adviser seemed to do all that was possible and to strain every nerve to get Levin out of his difficulties .
everybody was kind and am@@ i@@ able , but still it turned out that what he wanted to circumvent started up again in another place and impeded him once more .
it was specially annoying to Levin to be quite unable to understand with whom he was cont@@ ending , and whom the delay in his business could profit .
no one , not even his lawyer , seemed to know this .
he always sided with the Nob@@ ility in everything , openly opposed the spread of popular education , and gave a class character to the Zem@@ st@@ vo , which should have such enormous importance .
in the wealthy Province of Kash@@ in , always ahead of all others , such forces were now assembled that , if matters were here managed as they should be , it might serve as an example to other Prov@@ in@@ ces and to the whole of Russia .
the affair was therefore of great importance .
to replace S@@ net@@ kov as Mar@@ sh@@ al , S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky was proposed , or , better still , Nev@@ ed@@ ovsky , an ex @@@ -@@ @ professor , a remarkably intelligent man , and a great friend of Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev 's .
Levin , wishing to enter fully into everything and not to miss anything , stood there too in the crowd , and heard the Governor say : ' please tell Mary Ivan@@ ovna that my wife is very sorry she has to go to the Or@@ phan@@ age . '
then the no@@ bl@@ emen g@@ aily scram@@ bled for their over@@ coats and all drove to the cathedral .
in the cathedral Levin , with the others , raised his hand , repeating the words of the priest , and s@@ wore by the most awful o@@ aths to fulfil all the things the Governor had hoped for .
on the fourth day the audit of the Prov@@ in@@ cial Fun@@ ds was undertaken , and now for the first time there was a conflict between the new and old parties .
the Commission entrusted with the task of auditing reported to the Assembly that the sums were all correct .
the no@@ bles loudly applauded him and pressed his hand .
but at that moment one of the no@@ bles of Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev 's party said he had heard that the Commission had not audited the funds , considering that a verification would be an insult to the Mar@@ sh@@ al of the Province .
a member of the Commission im@@ prud@@ ently confirmed this .
there@@ upon the members of the Commission withdrew their report and Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev began very logically to prove that they must admit either that they had audited the accounts or that they had not done so , and to elaborate this dilemma .
a speaker of the opposite party replied to Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev .
then S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky spoke , and then the ven@@ om@@ ous gentleman once more .
Levin was surprised that they disputed about it so long , especially as , when he asked Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev whether he thought that money had been mis@@ appropri@@ ated , he received the reply :
for some of the districts the election was stor@@ my enough ; but for the Sel@@ ez@@ ensk district S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky was elected without opposition , and he gave a dinner party at his house that evening .
on THE sixth DA@@ Y the Prov@@ in@@ cial elections were to be held .
the large and small halls were full of no@@ bl@@ emen in various uniforms .
many had come for that day only .
men who had long not met - some from the Crimea , some from Petersburg , and some from abroad - came together in those halls .
by their external appearance the no@@ bles were sharply divided into two sorts : the old and the young .
the old , for the most part , either wore old @@@ -@@ @ fashioned but@@ t@@ oned @@@ -@@ @ up uniforms of their class and carried s@@ words and hats , or wore the naval , cav@@ alry , or infantry uniforms to which each was individually entitled .
the uniforms of the old no@@ bl@@ emen were cut in the old @@@ -@@ @ fashioned way , with pu@@ ffs at the shoulders , and were clearly too small for them , being short @@@ -@@ @ wai@@ sted and narrow as if their wear@@ ers had grown out of them .
the young men wore long @@@ -@@ @ wai@@ sted loose uniforms wide across the shoulders with white wai@@ st@@ coats , or else were in uniforms with black col@@ lars embroi@@ dered with lau@@ rel leaves - the emblem of the Ministry of Justice .
to the young party also belonged the Court uniforms , which here and there ornam@@ ented the crowd .
but the division into young and old did not coincide with the separation into parties .
some of the young ones , as Levin observed , belonged to the old party , and on the other hand some very aged no@@ bl@@ emen convers@@ ed in whis@@ pers with S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky and evidently were warm parti@@ sans of the new party .
Levin stood with his own group in the Small Hall , which was used as a refresh@@ ment and smoking room , listening to what was being said and v@@ ain@@ ly str@@ aining his mental powers to understand it all .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev was the centre around whom the rest were grouped .
he was now listening to S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky and H@@ ly@@ u@@ st@@ ov , the Mar@@ sh@@ al of another district , who also belonged to their party .
H@@ ly@@ u@@ st@@ ov was unwilling to go with the members for his district to invite S@@ net@@ kov to stand again for election . S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky was persuading him to do so and Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev approved of this .
Levin did not see why his party should ask the Mar@@ sh@@ al to stand , when they wished to defeat him .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , who had just had something to eat and drink , came toward them in his Cham@@ ber@@ lain 's uniform , wi@@ ping his mouth with his s@@ cent@@ ed and bor@@ dered lawn hand@@ ker@@ chief .
'@@ We are holding the position , Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich ! ' said he , smoo@@ thing back his whis@@ kers .
and after listening to the conversation he backed S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky 's opinion .
'@@ One district is sufficient , and S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky evidently belongs to the Op@@ position , ' he said , and every one but Levin understood him .
'@@ Well , Ko@@ st@@ ya ! you too seem to have got a taste for it ? ' he said , turning to Levin and taking him by the arm .
'@@ o Sanc@@ ta simpl@@ ic@@ itas ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , and briefly and clearly explained the matter to Levin .
'@@ If , as in former elections , all the districts nominated the Prov@@ in@@ cial Mar@@ sh@@ al , he would be elected , receiving white balls from every one .
this we do not want .
now eight districts are willing to invite him to stand again ; if two districts refuse to do so , S@@ net@@ kov may decline to stand and then the old party might choose another of their members , and then all calculations would be upset .
but if only S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky 's district does not invite him , S@@ net@@ kov will stand .
he will even get a good number of votes , so that the Op@@ position will be mis@@ led , and when a candidate of ours stands they will give him some votes . '
Levin W@@ AS ST@@ AND@@ ING SO@@ ME WA@@ Y OFF .
he could not hear distinctly because of the ster@@ tor@@ ous and ho@@ arse breathing of one no@@ bl@@ eman near him and the cre@@ aking of the st@@ out shoes of another .
he could hear only the distant soft voice of the Mar@@ sh@@ al , then the shr@@ ill voice of the ven@@ om@@ ous no@@ bl@@ eman , and then S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky 's voice .
he waited for the ven@@ om@@ ous no@@ bl@@ eman to conclude , and then said he considered the proper course would be to consult the wording of the Act and requested the Secretary to look it up .
the Act provided that in case of a difference of opinion the question should be ballo@@ ted upon .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev read the Act aloud , and began to explain its meaning , but a tall , thick @@@ -@@ @ set , round @@@ -@@ @ shoul@@ dered land@@ owner with a dy@@ ed mou@@ st@@ ache , wearing a tight uniform the high collar of which squeezed up his neck at the back , interrupted him .
advancing to the table he struck his ring against it , shouting in a loud voice :
'@@ Vo@@ te !
enough talking !
at this several voices were heard , and the tall land@@ owner with the ring , growing more and more sp@@ it@@ eful , shouted louder and louder ; but it was impossible to make out what he was saying .
sh@@ outs arose , and for a moment there was such confusion that the Mar@@ sh@@ al had to call for order .
we shed our blood ...
kindly ballot ! ...
ab@@ om@@ in@@ able ! ' was heard shouted by sp@@ it@@ eful furious voices from every side .
they expressed impl@@ ac@@ able hatred .
Levin could not at all understand what was the matter , and was ast@@ ounded at the ard@@ our with which they discussed the question whether Fl@@ er@@ ov 's case should be put to the ballot or not .
'a single vote may decide the whole matter , and one must be serious and consistent if one wishes to be of public service , ' Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev had said in conclusion .
but Levin had forgotten that , and it p@@ ained him to see these good men , whom he respected , in such an unpleasant , mal@@ evolent state of excitement .
to free himself from this feeling he went , without waiting to hear the end of the discussion , into the refresh@@ ment room , where there was no one except the wa@@ it@@ ers at the buffet .
he began pac@@ ing up and down the room , watching the wa@@ it@@ ers with pleasure .
he was particularly pleased by one old man with grey whis@@ kers , who while ev@@ inc@@ ing contempt for the young men who were making fun of him was teaching them how to fold n@@ ap@@ kins .
Levin was just preparing to start a conversation with the old wa@@ iter when the Secretary of the Court of Nob@@ ility , an old man whose speciality it was to know all the no@@ bles of the Province by name and patron@@ ym@@ ic , diverted his attention .
'@@ Please come , Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich ! ' said he . ' your brother is looking for you .
Levin entered the Hall , was given a white ball , and , following his brother , Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich , approached the table at which S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky stood with an ir@@ on@@ ical and impressive look on his face , gathering his beard into his fist and sm@@ elling at it .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev inserted his hand in the ballot @@@ -@@ @ box and placed his ball somewhere , and making way for Levin paused beside him .
Levin came up , but having entirely forgotten how the matter stood and being confused he turned to Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev with the inquiry , ' Where am I to put it ? '
he spoke in a low voice at a time when people near by were talking , so he hoped his question would not be heard .
but the talk stopped and his improper question was heard .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev fro@@ w@@ ned .
'@@ That depends on each man 's convictions , ' he said severely .
several persons smiled .
when he had done so he recoll@@ ected that he ought to have put in his left hand also , and thrust it in , but it was too late ; and feeling still more confused he hur@@ ried away to the very back of the room .
'@@ One hundred and twenty @@@ -@@ @ six for ' !
Fl@@ er@@ ov was qualified and the new party had scored .
but the old party did not consider itself defeated .
Levin heard S@@ net@@ kov being asked to stand ; and he saw that a crowd of no@@ bles surrounded the Mar@@ sh@@ al , who was speaking .
repl@@ ying to the no@@ bles , S@@ net@@ kov spoke of the confidence and affection of the Nob@@ ility , of which he was not worthy , his merit consisting only in his loyalty to the Nob@@ ility , to whom he had devoted twenty years of service .
several times he repeated the words : ' have served to the extent of my power - faithfully and truly - I appreciate and thank ... ' Then suddenly cho@@ ked by tears , he stopped , and left the room .
in the doorway the Mar@@ sh@@ al came into collision with Levin .
'@@ Sor@@ ry ! please excuse me ! ' he said , speaking as to a stranger ; but , recognizing Levin , he smiled tim@@ idly .
it seemed to Levin that S@@ net@@ kov wished to say something but could not speak from agitation .
the expression of his face and his whole figure , in uniform with crosses and white trous@@ ers trim@@ med with gold lace , as he went hur@@ ri@@ edly along , reminded Levin of a hun@@ ted animal conscious that things are going badly with him .
this expression on the Mar@@ sh@@ al 's face touched Levin , particularly because , just the day before , he had been to his house about the wardship and had there seen him in all the dignity of a kind @@@ -@@ @ hearted family man .
now the old man seemed touching and pathetic to Levin and he wished to say something pleasant to him .
'@@ So you are to be our Mar@@ sh@@ al again , ' said he .
'@@ Har@@ dly ! ' replied the Mar@@ sh@@ al , looking round with a frightened expression . ' I am tired and old .
and the Mar@@ sh@@ al disappeared through a side @@@ -@@ @ door .
the most solemn moment had arrived .
the elections were about to begin .
'@@ i have brought one . I s@@ oused him , ' said the land@@ owner who had been to fetch him , approaching S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky . ' he 'll do . '
'@@ He 's not very drunk - he won '@@ t fall down ? ' asked S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky , sw@@ aying his head .
'@@ no , he 's fine .
I told the man at the bar on no account to let him have anything ! '
the . narrow RO@@ OM IN WH@@ IC@@ H TH@@ E@@ Y W@@ ERE eating arid smoking was full of no@@ bl@@ emen .
the excitement was ever increasing and anxiety was noticeable on all the faces .
especially excited were the leaders , who knew all the details and the estimates of votes .
they were directors of the impending battle .
the others , like the rank and file before a battle , though preparing for the fight , sought distraction meanwhile .
some of them ate , standing or hastily sitting down at the table , others smoked cigarettes , pac@@ ing up and down the long room , and talked to friends they had not seen for a long time .
Levin had noticed him at the elections the day before and had carefully avoided meeting him .
he went to the window and sat down , looking at the different groups and listening to what was being said around him .
'@@ He is such a r@@ as@@ cal !
I told him not to !
and casting a dis@@ cont@@ ented glance at Levin , he suddenly turned away .
'@@ Yes , it 's a dirty business , say what you will , ' remarked an under@@ sized man with a fee@@ ble voice .
following those two a whole crowd of land@@ owners surrounding a st@@ out General , hastily approached Levin .
obviously they were seeking a place where they could talk without being over@@ heard .
'@@ How dare he say I gave orders to steal his trous@@ ers ?
I expect he drank them .
I snap my fingers at him and his prin@@ cely title !
'@@ What the devil do I care about the statute ?
I speak frankly .
'@@ Come , your Excell@@ ency ! a glass of fine champagne ! '
another group followed close on the heels of a no@@ bl@@ eman who was shouting loudly . he was one of those who had been made drunk .
'@@ i always advised Mary Sem@@ en@@ ovna to let her estate , because she will never make it pay , ' said a pleasant @@@ -@@ @ voiced land@@ owner with a grey mou@@ st@@ ache , wearing the uniform of Colonel of the former General Staff .
it was the land@@ owner Levin had met at S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky 's house .
he knew him at once .
the land@@ owner also recognized Levin and they shook hands .
'@@ Very pleased to see you !
of course I remember you very well .
last year , at S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky the Mar@@ sh@@ al 's house . '
'@@ Well , how is your hus@@ band@@ ry getting on ? ' Levin inqui@@ red .
'@@ i must confess to you that I only im@@ perfectly understand the meaning of these Nob@@ ility elections , ' said Levin .
the land@@ owner looked at him .
'@@ But what is there to understand ?
it has no meaning whatever .
the Nob@@ ility is an obsolete institution which continues to act through inertia .
look at the uniforms ! they tell the tale : this is an assembly of J@@ ustices of the Peace , permanent officials , and so on , but not of no@@ bles ! '
'@@ Then why do you come ? asked Levin .
'@@ From habit , for one thing .
it 's a sort of moral obligation .
and then , to tell the truth , I have a private reason .
but why do such gentlemen come ? ' he went on , indicating the ven@@ om@@ ous gentleman who had spoken at the Prov@@ in@@ cial table .
they are land@@ owners ; we are country s@@ qui@@ res .
'@@ But you say it is an obsolete institution ! '
'@@ It is obsolete certainly ; but all the same one should treat it more respec@@ tfully .
whether we are good or bad , we have been growing for a thousand years .
it can '@@ t be grown in a year , ' he remarked cauti@@ ously , immediately changing the subject . ' well , and how is your hus@@ band@@ ry getting on ? '
you know you too are worth something !
now , take me .
before I took to farming I was getting three thousand roubles a year in the Service .
now I work harder than I did in the Service , and like yourself I clear about five per cent . , and that only with luck .
'@@ Then why do you go on with it , if it is a clear loss ? '
it 's a habit , and one knows that it 's necessary !
'@@ Yes , yes , ' said Levin , ' that is quite so !
I always feel that I am getting no real profit out of my estate and yet I go on ...
one feels a sort of duty toward the land . '
'@@ i 'll tell you something , ' continued the land@@ owner . ' my neighbour , a merchant , called on me , and we went over the farm and garden together .
he said , " Everything is going as it should , only your garden is neglected , " though my garden is quite in order .
" if I were you , I should cut down those lim@@ es , but it must be done when the s@@ ap rises .
and the tr@@ unks could be cut up for log hu@@ ts ! " '
'@@ You are married , I hear ? ' said the land@@ owner .
the land@@ owner smiled under his grey mou@@ st@@ ache .
'@@ But why don '@@ t we do like the merchant ?
why don '@@ t we cut down our lim@@ es for b@@ ast ? ' said Levin , returning to the thought that had struck him .
'@@ Why , as you have said , we guard the fire !
our work is not done here , at the elections , but at our homes .
we have a class instinct as to what should not be done .
I see it in the peasants too sometimes : a proper peasant always tries to get hold of as much land as possible .
however bad the land , still he Pl@@ ough@@ s it .
'@@ Just like us , ' said Levin . ' very , very glad to have met you , ' he added , seeing S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky approaching .
'@@ We two have met for the first time since we were at your house , ' said the land@@ owner , ' and have indul@@ ged in a chat . '
'@@ Yes , and have you been ab@@ using the new order ? ' asked S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky with a smile .
S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky TO@@ OK Levin 's arm and led him back to his own group .
this time it was impossible to avoid V@@ ron@@ sky .
he was standing with O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky and Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , and looked straight at Levin as he came up .
'@@ Very pleased !
I think I had the pleasure of meeting you ... at the Princess Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky 's ? ' said he , holding out his hand to Levin .
'@@ Yes , I well remember our meeting , ' said Levin , and bl@@ ushing scar@@ let immediately turned and spoke to his brother .
'@@ What is delaying matters now ? ' asked Levin gl@@ ancing at S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky and V@@ ron@@ sky .
he must either decline or accept , ' replied S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky .
'@@ That 's just it : neither the one nor the other , ' answered V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ And if he should refuse , who will stand ? ' asked Levin , looking at V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ Who@@ ever likes , ' replied S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky .
'@@ Will you ? ' asked Levin .
'@@ Cer@@ tain@@ ly not I , ' said S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky , becoming embarrassed and casting an al@@ armed glance at the ven@@ om@@ ous gentleman , who was standing beside Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev .
Nev@@ ed@@ ovsky ? ' said Levin , feeling that he had put his foot in it somehow .
but this was still worse .
Nev@@ ed@@ ovsky and S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky were the two prospective candidates .
'@@ Not I , not on any account ! ' said the ven@@ om@@ ous gentleman .
so this was Nev@@ ed@@ ovsky !
S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky introduced him to Levin .
'@@ Well , has it touched you to the quick too ? ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , win@@ king at V@@ ron@@ sky . ' it 's like the races .
'@@ Yes , it does touch one to the quick , ' replied V@@ ron@@ sky , ' and having once taken the matter up , one wants to carry it through .
it 's a struggle ! ' he said fro@@ w@@ ning , and closed his powerful jaw .
'@@ What a capable man S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky is !
'@@ Oh yes , ' replied V@@ ron@@ sky absent @@@ -@@ @ min@@ dedly .
'@@ And how is it that you , living constantly in the country ; are not a Justice of the Peace ?
'@@ Because I consider that the magistr@@ acy is an idi@@ otic institution , ' mor@@ os@@ ely replied Levin , who had all the time been looking for an opportunity of speaking to V@@ ron@@ sky , to at@@ one for his ru@@ den@@ ess at their first encounter .
'@@ i don '@@ t think so ; on the contrary ... ' said V@@ ron@@ sky with calm surprise .
'@@ It 's a game , ' Levin interrupted . ' we don '@@ t need any J@@ ustices of the Peace .
I have not had a single case in eight years , and when I did have one it was decided wrong@@ ly .
the Justice 's Court is forty ver@@ sts from my house .
to settle a matter worth two roubles I should have to send an attorney who costs me fifteen . '
and he related how a peasant stole some flour from a mil@@ ler , and how when the mil@@ ler spoke to him about it the peasant su@@ ed him for li@@ bel .
all this was un@@ timely and foolish , and Levin himself was conscious of it even while he spoke .
'@@ Oh , he is such a c@@ rank ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky with his smoo@@ th@@ est and most al@@ mon@@ dy smile . ' but come ! I think the ballot has begun ... '
and they separated .
'@@ i don '@@ t understand , ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , who had observed his brother 's awkward s@@ ally , ' I don '@@ t understand how one can be so entirely devoid of political t@@ act !
that is what we Russians lack .
but Count V@@ ron@@ sky ... I do not make a friend of him ; he invited me to dinner and I Sh@@ an '@@ t go ; but he is one of our party , so why make an enemy of him ?
then you ask Nev@@ ed@@ ovsky whether he will stand .
'@@ Oh , I understand nothing about it !
it is all tri@@ fling , ' said Levin , glo@@ om@@ ily .
'@@ There , you say it 's all tri@@ fling , but when you begin on it you make a mess of everything . '
Levin remained silent and they entered the Large Hall together .
the Mar@@ sh@@ al of the Province , though he felt in the air that there was a plot prepared against him , and though he had not been unanimously asked to stand , had still decided to do so .
the District Mar@@ sh@@ als carried little plates filled with ballot balls from their own tables to the Prov@@ in@@ cial table , and the election began .
but Levin had forgotten the plan which had been explained to him , and was afraid that O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky was making a mistake when he said ' right . '
surely S@@ net@@ kov was their opponent !
while approaching the box he had the ball in his right hand , but , thinking it was a mistake , he shifted it to his left hand just as he reached the box , and evidently placed it to the left .
there was nothing for him to exercise his penetration upon this time .
then a solitary voice proclaimed the number for and against .
the Mar@@ sh@@ al had received a considerable majority .
a clam@@ our arose and every one rushed to the door .
S@@ net@@ kov entered and the no@@ bl@@ emen thr@@ ong@@ ed around him with congratulations .
'@@ Well , is it over now ? ' Levin asked his brother .
'@@ It 's only beginning ! ' S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky smil@@ ingly answered for Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev . ' the other candidate may get still more votes . '
Levin had again forgotten about that .
he only now remembered that there was some sub@@ tl@@ ety in it , but he was too bored to recoll@@ ect what it was .
he was overcome by depression and wanted to get out of that crowd .
as no one was paying any attention to him , and he apparently was not wanted by anybody , he went quietly to the small refresh@@ ment @@@ -@@ @ room and again felt great relief when he saw the wa@@ it@@ ers .
the old wa@@ iter offered him something to eat and Levin accepted .
having eaten a cut@@ let and beans , and talked with the old man about his former masters , Levin , not wishing to return to the hall where he had felt so out of his element , went up into the gallery .
the gallery was crowded with smar@@ tly @@@ -@@ @ dressed women who leaned over the bal@@ u@@ str@@ ade and tried not to miss a single word of what was being said below .
beside the women sat or stood elegant lawyers , spectac@@ led High School teachers , and officers .
every one was talking about the elections and how tired out the Mar@@ sh@@ al was and how interesting the debates had been . in one group Levin heard them pra@@ ising his brother .
'@@ How glad I am to have heard Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev !
it was worth while going a little hungry .
so clear and audi@@ ble !
there now , no one speaks like that in your Court - except perhaps May@@ del , and even he is far less eloqu@@ ent ! '
having found a vacant place at the bal@@ u@@ str@@ ade , Levin le@@ ant over and began to look and listen .
the no@@ bl@@ emen were sitting behind partitions , arranged according to their districts .
'@@ as candidate for the post of Prov@@ in@@ cial Mar@@ sh@@ al , Captain Eugene Ivan@@ ich A@@ pu@@ kh@@ tin will now be ballo@@ ted for . '
then followed a dead silence , and a fee@@ ble voice was heard saying :
'@@ Dec@@ lines , ' shouted a youthful sque@@ ak@@ y voice .
a similar announcement was made , and again followed by ' declines . '
Levin , leaning over the bal@@ u@@ str@@ ade , looked on and listened .
at first he was surprised and wanted to understand what it meant ; then , coming to the conclusion that he could not understand it , he grew bored .
then , remembering the agitation and anger he had witnessed on all faces , he felt sad , and with the intention of leaving the place went down@@ stairs .
on the stairs he met a couple : a lady running up swiftly in her high @@@ -@@ @ he@@ eled shoes , and the Assistant Public Prosecutor .
'@@ i said you would be in time , ' the Assistant said , as Levin stepped aside to let the lady pass .
Levin was already descending the stairs to the exit and getting out his clo@@ ak@@ room ticket when the Secretary caught him . ' please come , Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich ! they are voting ! '
Levin went up to the door of the hall : it was locked .
the Secretary knocked , the door opened and two land@@ owners with fl@@ ushed faces plunged out past Levin .
'@@ i can '@@ t stand it ! ' cried one of the red @@@ -@@ @ faced land@@ owners .
his face was dreadful from its expression of exhaustion and fear .
'@@ i told you to let no one out ! ' he shouted to the door@@ keeper . ' I was letting people in , Your Excell@@ ency ! '
'@@ Oh , Lord ! ' said the Mar@@ sh@@ al of the Province with a deep sigh ; and with his weary legs in the white trous@@ ers dragging , and hanging his head , he went down the middle of the hall to the chief table .
Nev@@ ed@@ ovsky had a majority as they had expected and he was now Mar@@ sh@@ al of the Province .
many were cheerful , many cont@@ ented and happy , many were in ecstasy and many dissatisfied and miserable .
the old Mar@@ sh@@ al was in despair and could not hide it .
the newly @@@ -@@ @ elected marsh@@ al , of the Province and many of the victorious new party d@@ ined that evening at V@@ ron@@ sky 's .
but he had not at all expected that the election business would interest him so much and so touch him to the quick , or that he could do it so well .
he was quite a new man in this circle of noble land@@ owners , but he evidently was a success ; and he was not mistaken in thinking that he had already gained influence among them .
he saw clearly , and others acknowledged , that he had contributed very much to Nev@@ ed@@ ovsky 's success .
now , at his own table , celebrating Nev@@ ed@@ ovsky 's election , V@@ ron@@ sky experienced a pleasant feeling of triumph .
they were now celebrating the j@@ ockey 's victory .
V@@ ron@@ sky sat at the head of the table ; on his right was the young Governor , a General of the Emperor 's suite .
on V@@ ron@@ sky 's left sat Nev@@ ed@@ ovsky with his youthful , do@@ gged , and ven@@ om@@ ous look .
toward him V@@ ron@@ sky was simple and cour@@ te@@ ous .
S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky bore his failure cheer@@ fully .
it was not even a failure for him ; as he himself said to Nev@@ ed@@ ovsky , champagne glass in hand , no better representative of the new course which the Nob@@ ility ought to follow could have been found .
and therefore all that was honest , as he remarked , was on the side of to @@@ -@@ @ day 's success and triumph@@ ed in it .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky too was pleased that he had spent his time mer@@ r@@ ily and that every one was satisfied .
S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky com@@ ically mim@@ icked the old Mar@@ sh@@ al 's t@@ ear@@ ful speech and , turning to Nev@@ ed@@ ovsky , remarked that His Excell@@ ency would have to adopt a different and more complex method of auditing the funds than tears !
during the dinner they continually spoke of Nev@@ ed@@ ovsky as ' Our Prov@@ in@@ cial Mar@@ sh@@ al ' and addressed him as ' Your Excell@@ ency . '
this was uttered with the same pleasure with which a newly @@@ -@@ @ married woman is addressed as Mad@@ ame and called by her husband 's name .
during the dinner several tele@@ grams were sent to persons interested in the elections .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , who was feeling very j@@ ol@@ ly , sent one to Dol@@ ly which ran as follows : ' Nev@@ ed@@ ovsky elected by majority of twenty .
he dictated it aloud , saying , ' I must che@@ er them up ! '
but Dol@@ ly , on receiving the tel@@ eg@@ ram , only sigh@@ ed over the rouble it had cost , and understood that it had been sent toward the end of a dinner .
everything , including the splendid dinner and the wines - which did not come from Russian merchants but were imported ready @@@ -@@ @ bottled from abroad - was very distinguished , simple , and gay .
the company of twenty men had been selected by S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky from adherents of the new movement and from Liber@@ als , men who were also wit@@ ty and respectable .
Heal@@ ths were drunk , also half in j@@ est , to the new Prov@@ in@@ cial Mar@@ sh@@ al , to the Governor , to the Bank Director , and to ' our am@@ i@@ able host . '
V@@ ron@@ sky was satisfied .
'@@ There will be a ball afterwards and you will see our Society beauty !
'@@ Not in my line , ' answered V@@ ron@@ sky , who was fond of that English expression , but he smiled and promised to come .
'@@ From Vo@@ z@@ d@@ vi@@ zhen@@ sk , by express messenger , ' he said with a significant glance .
'@@ It is extraordinary how much he resembles the Public Prosecutor S@@ venti@@ tsky , ' remarked one of the guests in French of the val@@ et , while V@@ ron@@ sky , fro@@ w@@ ning , read his letter .
the letter was from Anna .
even before he read it he knew its contents .
expecting the elections to end in five days , he had promised to return on the Friday .
it was now Saturday , and he knew that the letter contained repro@@ aches for his not having returned punc@@ tually .
the letter he had sent off the evening before had probably not yet reached her .
the contents of the letter were just what he expected , but its form was unexpected and particularly unpleasant to him .
'@@ An@@ nie is very ill . the doctor says it may be inflammation .
I expected you the day before yesterday , and yesterday , and am now sending to find out where you are and what the matter is .
I wished to come myself , but changed my mind knowing that you would not like it .
give me some reply that I may know what to do . '
baby was ill , and she wished to come herself ?
their child ill , and this hostile tone !
the innocent mir@@ th of the elections and this dismal bur@@ den@@ some love to which he must return struck V@@ ron@@ sky by their contrast .
but he had to go , and he took the first train that night for his home .
but the cold , stern look on his face when he came to tell her he was going offended her , and even before he had gone her compos@@ ure was upset .
later on , med@@ itating in sol@@ itude on that look - which expressed his right to freedom - she , as usual , came only to a consciousness of her own humiliation .
'@@ He has the right to go when and where he pleas@@ es .
not only to go away , but to leave me .
but , knowing this , he ought not to do it !
he has looked at me col@@ dly and severely .
of course it is inde@@ fin@@ able , intangible , but it was not so formerly , and that look means much , ' she thought . ' that look shows that he is beginning to grow cold . '
though she was convinced that this was the case , she could not do anything , could not in any way change her relation to him .
true , there was one means , not of holding him - for that purpose she wished for nothing except his love - but of putting herself in such a position that he could not abandon her .
that means was divorce and marriage .
she began to wish for this , and decided to agree the first time he or Steve should mention it to her .
with these thoughts in her mind she spent five days , the days she expected him to be away .
walks , talks with the Princess Barbara , visits to the hospital , and above all reading , reading one book after another , filled her time .
but on the sixth day , when the co@@ ach@@ man returned from the station without him , she felt that she was no longer able to stifle the thought of him and of what he was doing .
just then her little girl fell ill .
Anna nur@@ sed her , but this did not divert her thoughts especially as the illness was not dangerous .
next morning she received his letter and regre@@ tted her own .
she anticipated with horror a repetition of that stern look he had thrown at her when leaving , especially when he should learn that the little girl was not dangerously ill .
Anna now acknowledged to herself that he was weary of her and would regret giving up his freedom to return to her ; yet in spite of this she was glad that he would come .
let him feel weary , but let him be here with her so that she might see him and know his every movement .
she was sitting in the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room , reading by lam@@ plight a new book by T@@ aine , listening to the wind outside , and expecting every moment the arrival of the carriage .
several times she had thought she heard the sound of wheels but had been mistaken ; at last she heard not only the wheels but also the co@@ ach@@ man 's voice and a dull rum@@ bling in the por@@ tic@@ o .
even the Princess Barbara , who was playing patience , confirmed this , and Anna , fl@@ ushing , rose , but instead of going down@@ stairs , as she had already done twice , she stood still .
she suddenly felt ashamed of having deceived him and still more afraid of how he might treat her .
the feeling of injury had already passed , and she only feared the expression of his dis@@ pleasure .
she remembered that the child had been quite well since yesterday .
she was even v@@ exed with her for having recovered as soon as the letter had been sent .
then she recoll@@ ected that he was here , all of him , his hands , his eyes .
she heard his voice , and forgetting everything else ran joy@@ fully to meet him .
he was sitting on a chair , and the foot@@ man was pulling off his warm boots .
'@@ And you ? ' he asked , giving himself a shake .
she took his hand in both hers and drew it to her waist , not taking her eyes off him .
'@@ Well , I 'm very glad , ' he said , col@@ dly surve@@ ying her co@@ i@@ ff@@ ure and the dress which , he knew , she had put on for him .
all this pleased him , but it had already pleased him so often !
and the stern and st@@ ony look , which she so dread@@ ed , settled on his face .
and you are well ? ' said he , wi@@ ping his wet beard with his hand@@ ker@@ chief , and kis@@ sing her hand .
'@@ no matter , ' she thought , ' if only he is here . when he is here he can '@@ t and d@@ are@@ n '@@ t fail to love me ! '
the evening passed happily and cheer@@ fully in the company of the Princess Barbara , who complained to him that in his absence Anna had been taking mor@@ phia .
'@@ What am I to do ?
I could not sleep ...
he told her about the elections , and Anna knew how by questions to lead him on to just what pleased him - his success .
she told him about everything that interested him at home , and all her news was most cheerful .
but late at night , when they were alone , Anna , seeing that she had regained full mastery of him , wanted to eff@@ ace the depressing impression of the look he gave her a@@ pro@@ po@@ s of the letter , and said :
'@@ But confess that you were v@@ exed to get my letter , and did not believe me ? '
as soon as she had said this she knew that , however lov@@ ingly disposed he might be to her , he had not forgiven her for that letter .
'@@ Yes , ' he answered . ' it was such a strange letter .
An@@ nie was ill , yet you wished to come yourself ! '
'@@ That was all true . '
'@@ i don '@@ t doubt it . '
I see you are dis@@ pleased . '
'@@ Not for a moment .
I am only dis@@ pleased , really , that you seem not to wish to admit that there are duties ... '
'@@ Don '@@ t let us talk about it , ' he said .
'@@ Why should we not talk about it ? ' she replied .
'@@ i only wished to say that one may have unavoidable business .
now , for instance , I shall have to go to Moscow about the house ...
Oh , Anna , why are you so irrit@@ able ?
Don '@@ t you know that I can '@@ t live without you ? '
'@@ If that is so , ' replied Anna in a suddenly changed voice , ' it must be that you are weary of this life ...
yes , you will come for a day and go away again , as men do ... '
'@@ Anna , that is cruel .
'@@ If you go to Moscow , I shall go too !
I will not stop here .
either we must separate or live together . '
'@@ You know that that is my desire !
but for that ... '
but I will go to Moscow with you . '
'@@ You speak as if you were threatening me !
why , I don '@@ t wish for anything so much as not to be separated from you , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , smil@@ ingly .
but not a cold look only but the angry look of a hun@@ ted and ex@@ as@@ per@@ ated man fl@@ ashed in his eyes as he spoke those tender words .
the look said , ' If so , this is a mis@@ fortune ! '
it was a mom@@ entary impression , but she never forgot it .
Anna wrote to her husband asking him for a divorce and at the end of November , having parted from the Princess Barbara , who had to go to Petersburg , she moved to Moscow with V@@ ron@@ sky .
daily expecting K@@ aren@@ in 's reply , to be followed by a divorce , they now established themselves like a married couple .
part VII
the Lev@@ ins H@@ AD BE@@ EN M@@ ORE TH@@ AN T@@ W@@ O months IN M@@ OSC@@ O@@ W .
the doctor , the mid@@ wife , Dol@@ ly , her mother , and especially Levin ( who could not think without horror of what was coming ) , began to experience impati@@ ence and anxiety ; Kit@@ ty alone was perfectly calm and happy .
she now distinctly realized the awakening of a new sense of ten@@ derness for the coming ( and for her to some extent already existing ) child , and she yielded with pleasure to that feeling .
it was no longer entirely part of herself , but now and then lived its own independent life .
sometimes this occa@@ sioned her pain , but at the same time she wanted to laugh because of this strange new joy .
the only thing that mar@@ red the charm of this life was that her husband was not as she loved him best , not as he used to be in the country .
she loved his quiet , kindly and hospitable manner on his estate .
in town he always seemed rest@@ less and on his guard , as if afraid lest some one should insult him or , worse still , her .
here in town he was always in a hurry , as if fearing to miss something , and yet he had nothing to do .
she was sorry for him .
but she understood him not from without but from within and saw that in town he was not himself ; she could not otherwise define his condition .
sometimes in her heart she repro@@ ached him for not knowing how to live in town ; at other times she confessed that it was really hard for him to arrange his life here satis@@ factor@@ ily .
indeed , what could he do ?
he did not care for cards .
she knew now what con@@ sorting with gay people of O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's sort meant - it meant drinking and then driving somewhere ...
she could not think without horror of where men drove to in such cases .
but she knew that to do so he would have to find pleasure in being with young women and she could not wish that .
stay at home with her and her mother and sisters ?
then what was left for him to do ?
continue to write his book ?
and he also complained that he had talked too much about his book here , so that all his ideas had become confused and he had lost interest in them .
the one advantage of this town @@@ -@@ @ life was that here they never quar@@ rel@@ led .
an event even occurred of great importance to them both in this respect , namely , Kit@@ ty 's meeting with V@@ ron@@ sky .
the old Princess , Mary Boris@@ ovna , Kit@@ ty 's god@@ mother , who had always been very fond of her , particularly wished to see her .
though Kit@@ ty was not going out anywhere because of her condition , yet she went with her father to see the vener@@ able old lady , and there met V@@ ron@@ sky .
but this lasted only a few seconds .
she exchanged a few words with V@@ ron@@ sky , and even smiled at a joke he made about the elections , to which he allu@@ ded as ' our parliament . '
( she had to smile to show that she understood the joke . )
she was pleased with herself .
Levin bl@@ ushed much more than she had done when she told him she had met V@@ ron@@ sky at the Princess Mary Boris@@ ovna 's .
it was very difficult for her to tell him this , and still more difficult to go on giving him details of the meeting , as he did not ask anything , but only fro@@ w@@ ned and looked at her .
'@@ i am very sorry you were not there , ' she said ; ' I don '@@ t mean present in the room ... I should not have behaved so naturally with you there ...
I am now bl@@ ushing much more - much , much more , ' she added , bl@@ ushing to tears , ' but I am sorry you could not look through a crack . '
her truthful eyes told Levin that she was satisfied with herself , and in spite of her bl@@ ushes he grew calm at once and began questioning her , which was just what she wanted .
'@@ It is so painful to think that there is a man who is almost my enemy , - whom I dislike to meet , ' said Levin . ' I am very , very glad ! '
'@@ Only going to see Kat@@ av@@ asov , ' answered Levin .
'@@ He promised to introduce me to Met@@ rov .
I want to have a talk with him about my work . he is a celebrated Petersburg scholar , ' replied Levin .
'@@ Oh yes ! it was his article you praised so ?
'@@ Then I may call round at the Cour@@ ts about my sister 's case . '
'@@ Oh yes , do go ! they are giving those new pieces ...
it used to interest you so .
I should certainly go . '
'@@ Well , in any case I will come back before dinner , ' he said , gl@@ ancing at his watch .
'@@ is it absolutely necessary then ? '
'@@ Yes , absolutely !
'@@ Well , will you believe it ? I have got so out of the habit that it makes me feel ashamed .
a stranger arrives , sits down , remains a while doing nothing , distur@@ bs them , up@@ sets himself , and goes away again . '
'@@ But as a bachelor you used to pay calls ? ' she said .
'@@ i did , but I always felt ashamed , and now I am so out of the habit of it that , seriously , I would rather go without dinner for two days than pay that call !
I will vou@@ ch for that ! ' said Kit@@ ty , looking laugh@@ ingly into his face .
please call on them ! '
he was about to go after kis@@ sing her hand , when she stopped him .
'@@ Ko@@ st@@ ya , do you know I have only fifty roubles left ? '
how much ? ' he asked , with a dissatisfied look familiar to her .
'@@ no , wait a moment . ' she held him by the hand .
there is something we don '@@ t do right . '
'@@ Not at all , ' he said , c@@ ough@@ ing and looking at her from under his brows .
she knew that cough .
with him it was a sign of great dis@@ pleasure , not with her but with himself .
he was really dissatisfied , not because they had spent so much but because he had been reminded of a matter which , well knowing that something was wrong , he wished to forget .
'@@ i have told Sokol@@ ov to sell the wheat and draw the money for the mill in advance .
'@@ Yes , but I 'm afraid that in general too much ... '
'@@ Not at all , not at all ! ' he repeated . ' well , good @@@ -@@ @ bye , dar@@ ling ! '
'@@ But , really , sometimes I am sorry I listened to M@@ ama !
how nice it would have been in the country !
as it is I have worn you all out , and we are wasting money ... '
not once since our marriage have I said to myself that things might have been better than they are ... '
'@@ is that true ? ' she said , looking into his eyes .
he had said it without thinking , to comfort her .
but when he looked and saw those dear , truthful eyes question@@ ingly fixed on him , he repeated the words from the bottom of his heart .
'@@ Deci@@ dedly I am forgetting her , ' he thought , remembering what was so soon awaiting them .
'@@ Will it be soon ?
how do you feel ? ' he whispered , taking both her hands in his .
'@@ i have so often thought so , that now I have given up thinking . '
she smiled cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ously .
'@@ Not an atom ! ' she answered .
we will call at Dol@@ ly 's .
I 'll expect you before dinner ...
do you know , Dol@@ ly 's situation is becoming quite impossible !
it is quite impossible .
we can '@@ t speak to Pap@@ a about it ...
but if you and he ... '
'@@ But what can we do ? ' said Levin .
'@@ Well , any@@ how , you will see Arsen@@ y . have a talk with him , and he will tell you what we decided . '
'@@ i 'm ready to agree with Arsen@@ y beforehand .
at the por@@ ch Kuz@@ ma , an old servant of his bachelor days , who was now managing the household in town , stopped Levin .
'@@ Kras@@ av@@ chik ' ( one of the pair of carriage horses brought from the country ) ' has been re @@@ -@@ @ sh@@ od but still goes lame , ' said he . ' what are your orders ? '
he wanted to arrange the matter as well and as cheaply as possible ; but it turned out that their own horses cost them more than hired ones would have done , and they hired horses as well .
'@@ Send for the vet , maybe it 's a bru@@ ise . '
'@@ Yes , and what will Catherine Alexand@@ rov@@ na do ? ' asked Kuz@@ ma .
now all this seemed quite natural .
and , thanks to the conditions of town life , having thus simply and easily solved a difficulty which in the country would have required much exer@@ tion and personal attention , Levin went out , called an iz@@ v@@ osh@@ chik , and drove to the Nik@@ it@@ skaya .
on his way he thought no more about money , but considered how he could make the acquaintance of the Petersburg scholar , who was studying sociology , and how he would talk to him about his book .
only during the very first days in Moscow had the un@@ productive but inevitable expenditure , so strange to country folk , yet demanded on all sides , star@@ tled Levin .
now he was used to it .
the notes he now changed no longer ev@@ oked such calculations , but flew away like we@@ e birds .
whether the pleasure afforded by what it purchased correspon@@ ded to the labour expen@@ ded in acquiring the money was a consideration long since lost sight of .
his farming calculations that there is a price below which certain grain must not be sold were forgotten too .
the ry@@ e - after he had so long held out for a certain price - was sold fifty kop@@ eks a ch@@ et@@ ver@@ t cheaper than had been offered him a month ago .
even the calculation that it would be impossible to live for a year at that rate of expenditure without running into debt - even that calculation had lost its meaning .
the one thing need@@ ful was to have money in the bank , without asking wh@@ ence it came , so as to be always sure of the where@@ with@@ al to get to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row 's beef .
till now he had always observed that rule ; he had always had money in the bank .
but now he had no money remaining there , and did not quite know where to get any .
it was this that had upset him for a moment when Kit@@ ty reminded him about money ; however , he had no time to think about it .
while driving he thought of Kat@@ av@@ asov and of making Met@@ rov 's acquaintance .
during H@@ IS ST@@ A@@ Y IN Moscow Levin had renewed his intim@@ acy with his fellow @@@ -@@ @ student of university days , now Professor Kat@@ av@@ asov , whom he had not seen since his marriage .
he liked Kat@@ av@@ asov because of his clear and simple outlook on life .
Levin had read some parts of his book to Kat@@ av@@ asov , who liked it .
'@@ Deci@@ dedly you are improving - quite a pleasure to see it , ' said Kat@@ av@@ asov as he welcomed Levin in the little drawing @@@ -@@ @ room . ' I heard the bell and thought " It 's impossible he can have come punc@@ tually .@@ ... "
they are born warriors ! '
Kat@@ av@@ asov in a few words told him the latest news , and , taking him into the study , introduced Levin to a tall , stur@@ dy , and very agre@@ eable @@@ -@@ @ looking man .
it was Met@@ rov .
the conversation rested for a time on politics and on how the highest circles in Petersburg regarded the latest events .
Met@@ rov quoted words an the subject attributed to the Emperor and one of the Ministers , which he had from a reliable source .
Kat@@ av@@ asov , however , had heard with equal defin@@ it@@ eness that the Emperor said something quite different .
Levin tried to imagine a situation in which both utter@@ ances might have been made , and the subject was dropped .
'@@ That is very interesting , ' said Met@@ rov .
'@@ But in what do you perceive the peculiar quality of the Russian worker ? ' asked Met@@ rov . ' in his zo@@ ological qualities , so to say , or in the conditions in which he is placed ? '
to illustrate this theory he ha@@ st@@ ened to add that , in his opinion , the Russian people view results from their consciousness of a vocation to popul@@ ate the vast uno@@ c@@ cu@@ pied trac@@ ts in the East .
'@@ It is easy to be led astr@@ ay when drawing conclusions as to the general vocation of a people , ' said Met@@ rov , interrup@@ ting Levin . ' the condition of the lab@@ ou@@ rer will always depend on his relation to land and capital . '
and without letting Levin finish explaining his idea , Met@@ rov began exp@@ ounding to him the peculi@@ arity of his own teaching .
he wanted to interrupt Met@@ rov and to state his own idea , which he considered would render a further statement of Met@@ rov 's view super@@ flu@@ ous .
but afterwards , having convinced himself that they looked at the question so differently that they would never understand one another , he ceased making objections and merely listened .
though what Met@@ rov was saying now no longer interested him at all , he felt some pleasure all the same in hearing him .
'@@ i 'm afraid we shall be late , ' said Kat@@ av@@ asov , gl@@ ancing at the clock as soon as Met@@ rov had finished his dis@@ qui@@ sition .
I have promised to read a paper on his work on Zo@@ ology .
I should very much like to hear your work . '
they began a conversation about a controversy in the university , which was one of the most important events in Moscow that winter .
this resolution was , in the opinion of some people , a dreadful one , while according to others it was very simple and just . the professors were divided into two camps .
the side to which Kat@@ av@@ asov belonged accused their opponents of mean treach@@ ery and deception ; while the others im@@ puted you@@ th@@ fulness and dis@@ respect for authority .
the meeting had already begun .
at the table covered with a cloth at which Kat@@ av@@ asov and Met@@ rov took their seats six men were sitting , and one of them , with his head bent close over a manuscript , was reading something .
Levin took one of the vacant chairs which were standing round the table , and in a whis@@ per asked a student who was sitting there what was being read .
with a dis@@ pleased look at Levin the student replied :
'@@ the biography ! '
though the biography of the scientist did not interest Levin , he listened involun@@ tarily and learned a few interesting facts about the celebrated man 's life .
when the reader had finished , the chairman thanked him and read aloud some verses for the jubilee sent by the poet ment , adding a few words of thanks to the poet .
when Kat@@ av@@ asov had finished , Levin looked at his watch , saw that it was getting on for two , and thought that there would be no time to read his manuscript to Met@@ rov before the concert , and besides , he no longer felt inclined to do so .
during the readings he had also been thinking about the talk they had had .
making up his mind to decline Met@@ rov 's invitation , therefore , Levin approached him as soon as the meeting ended .
Met@@ rov introduced him to the chairman , with whom he was discussing the political news .
after that they began talking about the university question .
as Levin had already heard all that , he ha@@ st@@ ened to tell Met@@ rov that he regre@@ tted he was unable to accept his invitation , shook hands , and drove off to the L@@ v@@ ov@@ s ' .
L@@ vo@@ v , WHO W@@ AS married to Kit@@ ty 's sister Nat@@ aly , had passed all his life in the capitals and abroad , where he had been educated and where he had been in the diplomatic service .
despite very acute differences in their habits and opinions , and the fact that L@@ vo@@ v was older than Levin , they became very intimate and attached to one another that winter .
Levin found L@@ vo@@ v at home , and entered un@@ announced .
his handsome , refined , and still young @@@ -@@ @ looking face , to which the cur@@ ly , glossy , silver hair gave a still more well @@@ -@@ @ bred appearance , lit up with a smile when he saw Levin .
he rose and pushed forward a roc@@ king @@@ -@@ @ chair . ' have you read the last circular in the Journal de St Peters@@ bourg ?
I think it splendid , ' said he with a slightly French accent .
Levin told him what he had heard from Kat@@ av@@ asov of what was said in Petersburg , and , after some talk on politics , Levin recoun@@ ted how he had made Met@@ rov 's acquaintance and had gone to the meeting .
this interested L@@ vo@@ v very much .
'@@ Oh , yes !
even for the children 's lessons I often have to refresh my memory , or even simply to learn things .
for it is not enough to have masters , one must have a supervisor as well , just as you have both lab@@ our@@ ers and an over@@ se@@ er on your estate .
I was just reading , ' and he showed Levin Bus@@ la@@ ev 's Gr@@ ammar which lay on the lec@@ tern . ' they expect M@@ isha to know this , and it is so difficult ...
he says here ... '
Levin tried to explain that it is impossible to understand it and that it must just be learnt by heart ; but L@@ vo@@ v did not agree with him .
'@@ Yes ! you laugh at it ! '
'@@ on the contrary ! you have no idea how , when I see you , I am always learning what awaits me - the education of my children . '
'@@ Oh , come ! you 've nothing to learn from me ! ' said L@@ vo@@ v .
'@@ all I know is that I never saw better brought up children than yours , ' said Levin , ' and do not wish for better children . '
L@@ vo@@ v evidently tried to restrain the expression of his delight , but a radiant smile lit up his face .
'@@ If only they turn out better than I !
that is all I desire .
you do not yet know all the difficulties one has with boys who , like mine , have been neglected through our life abroad , ' said he .
they are such gifted children !
that is what I learn by watching your children . '
'@@ You talk of moral training !
you can '@@ t imagine how difficult that is !
you have hardly mastered one fault when another crops up and there is a fresh struggle .
one must have the support of religion - you remember our talk about that ? ... No father relying on his own strength , without that support , could educate a child . '
I am dining with you to @@@ -@@ @ day .
look here , Arsen@@ y , ' she said , turning to her husband , ' you will take the carriage ... '
Levin , as one of the family , had to take part in the deliberations .
'@@ He spo@@ ils me , you know , ' said L@@ vo@@ v to his wife , indicating Levin . ' he assu@@ res me that our children are splendid , though I see so much that is bad in them . '
'@@ Arsen@@ y goes to extremes , as I always tell him , ' said his wife . ' if you look for perfection , you will never be satisfied .
nowadays parents are hardly allowed to live , and everything is for the children . '
'@@ Why not , if that is pleas@@ an@@ ter ? ' said L@@ vo@@ v with his handsome smile , touching her hand . ' those who don '@@ t know you would think you were not a mother but a step@@ mother ! '
'@@ no , extremes are not right in any case , ' said Nat@@ aly quietly , putting his paper @@@ -@@ @ knife in its right place on the table .
'@@ ah ! come here , you perfect children ! ' said L@@ vo@@ v to two little boys , who , after b@@ owing to Levin , approached their father , evidently wishing to ask him something .
Levin had forgotten the commission he had been charged with and only remembered it when on his way to the ante @@@ -@@ @ room .
'@@ Oh , Kit@@ ty wished me to have a talk with you about O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , ' he said , when L@@ vo@@ v paused on the stairs as he was seeing his wife and Levin down .
'@@ Yes , yes . Mam@@ an wishes us , les be@@ aux fr@@ è@@ res , [ The brothers @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law . ] to come down on him , ' said L@@ vo@@ v , bl@@ ushing . but why should I ?
'@@ Well then , I will be down on him ! ' said his wife smiling , as she stood in her white fur @@@ -@@ @ lined cloak waiting for them to finish their talk . ' come , let us go ! '
at THE MAT@@ IN@@ É@@ E CON@@ CER@@ T there were two very interesting items .
one was King Le@@ ar on the He@@ ath , a Fan@@ ta@@ sia , and the other was a qu@@ artet dedicated to the memory of B@@ ach .
both pieces were new and in the new style , and Levin was led to form an opinion on them .
he carefully avoided the musical experts and great tal@@ kers , and stood with lowered eyes gaz@@ ing straight before him , listening .
but the longer he listened to the King Le@@ ar Fan@@ ta@@ sia , the further he felt from the possibility of forming any definite opinion .
even these fragments of musical expression , though some of them were good , were un@@ pleasing because they were quite unexpected and unprepared for .
mir@@ th , sadness , despair , ten@@ derness , triumph came forth without any cause , like the thoughts of a mad@@ man .
and , as in the mind of a mad@@ man , these emotions vanished just as unexpectedly .
throughout the performance Levin felt like a deaf person watching a dance .
he was quite perpl@@ exed when the music stopped and felt very tired as a result of strained attention quite un@@ rewarded .
from all sides came loud applause .
wishing to clear up his own perpl@@ ex@@ ity by hearing other people 's impressions , Levin went to look for the experts , and was pleased to find a celebrated one chat@@ ting with his own acquaintance , P@@ est@@ sov .
'@@ Won@@ der@@ ful ! ' P@@ est@@ sov was saying in his deep bass .
'@@ Why , what has Cord@@ el@@ ia to do with it ? ' Levin asked tim@@ idly , having quite forgotten that the Fan@@ ta@@ sia presented King Le@@ ar on the he@@ ath .
'@@ Cord@@ el@@ ia appears ... here ! ' said P@@ est@@ sov , tapping with his fingers the glossy programme he was holding , and handing it to Levin .
'@@ You can '@@ t follow without it , ' said P@@ est@@ sov turning to Levin , as the man he had been talking to had gone away and he had no one else to talk to .
during the interval Levin and P@@ est@@ sov began a discussion on the merits and defects of the W@@ ag@@ ner@@ ian tendency in music .
'@@ the sculp@@ tor 's shadows so little resem@@ bled shadows that they even cl@@ ung to a ladder , ' said Levin .
he liked this phrase , but could not remember whether he had not used it before , and to P@@ est@@ sov himself , and after saying it he grew embarrassed .
P@@ est@@ sov argued that art was all one , and that it can only reach its highest manifestations by uniting all the different kinds of art .
on going out Levin met several other acquaintances with whom he talked about politics , music , and mutual friends ; among others he met Count Bo@@ l . he had quite forgotten his intended visit to him .
'@@ Well then , go at once , ' said the Princess L@@ v@@ ova , to whom he mentioned the matter . ' perhaps they won '@@ t receive you , and then call for me at the meeting .
'@@ PER@@ H@@ AP@@ S TH@@ E@@ Y Don '@@ t REC@@ E@@ IVE TO @@@ -@@ @ DA@@ Y ? ' said Levin as he entered the hall of Countess Bo@@ l 's house .
'@@ They do ; please walk in , ' said the hall @@@ -@@ @ porter , determin@@ edly helping him off with his over@@ coat .
'@@ What a nu@@ is@@ ance ! ' thought Levin with a sigh , as he pulled off one g@@ love and smoo@@ thed his hat . ' what is the good of my going in ? and what on earth am I to say to them ? '
as he entered the first drawing @@@ -@@ @ room he met in the doorway the Countess Bo@@ l , who with an anxious and stern expression was giving orders to a servant .
when she saw Levin she smiled and asked him into the next room , a smaller drawing @@@ -@@ @ room , wh@@ ence came the sound of voices .
'@@ How is your wife ?
have you been to the concert ?
we could not go .
M@@ ama had to attend the funeral . '
how sudden it was ! ' said Levin .
'@@ But she always was delicate . '
'@@ W@@ ere you at the opera last night ? '
'@@ Yes , splendid , ' he replied , and as he was quite indifferent to what they might think of him , he repeated what they had heard hundreds of times about the peculiarities of that singer 's talent .
the Countess Bo@@ l pre@@ tended to be listening .
when he had said enough and paused , the Colonel , who till then had kept silent , began also to talk about the opera and about the lighting of the opera @@@ -@@ @ house .
Levin rose too , but saw by the Countess 's face that it was not yet time for him to leave .
they say it will be very interesting , ' began the Countess .
'@@ no , but I promised my sister @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law to call for her there , ' said Levin .
there was a pause , and the mother exchanged g@@ lan@@ ces with her daughter .
'@@ Well , I expect it 's time now , ' thought Levin , and rose .
the hall @@@ -@@ @ porter as he helped him on with his over@@ coat asked where he was staying , and at once entered his address in a large well @@@ -@@ @ bound book .
Levin was in time to hear a summary which everybody said was very interesting .
Levin arrived AT THE CL@@ U@@ B IN GO@@ OD T@@ IME .
members and visitors were driving up as he got there .
he had long not been there - not since the days when after leaving the university he had lived in Moscow and gone out into Society .
he remembered the club and the external details of its rooms , but had quite forgotten the impression it then made upon him .
this hall @@@ -@@ @ porter not only knew Levin but knew all his connections and relatives as well , and at once mentioned some of his intimate friends .
he passed among the tables , which were nearly all occupied , surve@@ ying the guests .
here and there he came across all sorts of people he knew : old and young , some whom he only just knew and some with whom he was intimate .
there was not one angry or anxious face among them .
S@@ vi@@ yaz@@ h@@ sky and Sh@@ ch@@ erb@@ at@@ sky , Nev@@ ed@@ ovsky and the old Prince , V@@ ron@@ sky and Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , all were there .
'@@ Why are you so late ? ' asked the old Prince with a smile , holding out his hand over his shoulder . ' how is Kit@@ ty ? ' he added , smoo@@ thing the table @@@ -@@ @ n@@ ap@@ kin , which he had t@@ ucked in behind a button of his wai@@ st@@ coat .
'@@ She 's all right : they are all three dining together . '
go to that table , and be quick and secure a seat , ' said the old Prince , and turning away he carefully took a plate of fish soup that was handed to him .
'@@ Levin ! here ! ' shouted some one a little farther off , in a kindly voice .
he sat beside a young military man , and two chairs were til@@ ted against their table .
Levin joined them with pleasure .
he always liked that good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured sp@@ end@@ thri@@ ft T@@ uro@@ v@@ tsin ; with him was associated the memory of his proposal to Kit@@ ty ; but to @@@ -@@ @ day , after all those strained intellectual conversations , T@@ uro@@ v@@ tsin 's good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured face was particularly welcome .
'@@ These are for you and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
T@@ uro@@ v@@ tsin introduced him .
'@@ O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky is always late . '
'@@ Have you just come ? ' asked O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , ha@@ st@@ ening toward them . ' how do you do ?
well then , come ! '
it might have been thought that from a score of different h@@ ors d '@@ oeu@@ v@@ res it would be possible to select one to any taste , but O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky ordered something special , and one of the li@@ ver@@ ied foot@@ men brought it at once .
they drank a glass of vodka each and returned to their table .
while they were still at their soup Gag@@ in ordered a bottle of champagne and had four glasses filled .
Levin did not refuse the pro@@ ff@@ ered wine , and ordered another bottle .
he was hungry , and ate and drank with great pleasure , and with still greater pleasure took part in the simple mer@@ ry talk of his companions .
Gag@@ in , lowering his voice , related a new Petersburg anecdo@@ te which , though it was in@@ decent and stupid , was so funny that Levin burst into loud laughter and people turned to look at him .
'@@ That 's in the style of the story , " That 's just what I can '@@ t bear " ; do you know it ? ' asked O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . ' Oh , it 's delightful !
'@@ With Peter Ily@@ ich Vin@@ ovsky 's complim@@ ents , ' interrupted an old wa@@ iter , bringing two delicate glasses of still sparkling champagne on a tray , and addressing O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky and Levin .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky took a glass , and exchanging a look with a bal@@ d , red @@@ -@@ @ haired man with a mou@@ st@@ ache who sat at the other end of their table , smil@@ ingly nodded to him .
'@@ Who is that ? ' inqui@@ red Levin .
'@@ You once met him at my house , do you remember ?
Levin followed O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's example and took the glass .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's anecdo@@ te was very am@@ using too .
then Levin told one , which also was appreciated .
then they talked about horses , about that day 's races , and how gall@@ antly V@@ ron@@ sky 's At@@ l@@ as@@ ny had won the first prize .
'@@ ah , here they are ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , just as they were finishing , leaning back in his chair and stretching out his hand to V@@ ron@@ sky , who was approaching with a tall Colonel of the Guards .
g@@ aily leaning his arm on O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's shoulder , he whispered something to him , and with the same mer@@ ry smile held out a hand to Levin .
'@@ Very glad to meet you , ' he said . ' I looked for you that day at the elections , but was told you had already left . '
'@@ Yes , I left that same day .
we were just speaking about your horse .
I congratulate you ! ' said Levin . ' that was quick running ! '
'@@ no ; my father did , and I remember them and know something about them . '
'@@ Where did you dine ? ' asked O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ at the second table , behind the pillars . '
'@@ He has been congratulated ! ' remarked the Colonel . ' it 's the second time he 's won the Imperial prize . if only I had the luck at cards that he has with horses ! ...
but why waste the golden moments ?
I 'm off to the " in@@ fer@@ nal regions , " added he , and walked away .
'@@ That 's Y@@ ash@@ vin , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky in reply to T@@ uro@@ v@@ tsin 's question , as he took a vacant chair beside them .
whether influenced by the club or by the wine he had drunk , Levin chat@@ ted with V@@ ron@@ sky about the best breeds of cattle , and was very pleased to find that he had not the least anim@@ osity toward the man .
he even told V@@ ron@@ sky among other things that he had heard from his wife that she had met him at the Princess Mary Boris@@ ovna 's .
'@@ Oh , the Princess Mary Boris@@ ovna ! is@@ n '@@ t she charming ? ' cried O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , and related an anecdo@@ te about her which made them all laugh .
V@@ ron@@ sky especially burst into such good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ured laughter that Levin felt quite reconciled to him .
'@@ Well , have you finished ? ' asked O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , rising and smiling . ' let 's go ! '
on leaving THE T@@ ABLE Levin , feeling that as he went his arms swung with unusual regularity and ease , passed with Gag@@ in through the lofty apartments to the billi@@ ard @@@ -@@ @ room .
'@@ Well , and how do you like our Temple of id@@ l@@ eness ? ' said the Prince , giving him his arm . ' come , let 's walk about a little . '
'@@ Yes , it interests you , but my interest is different to yours .
'@@ You see , you don '@@ t even know the word !
it is a club term .
and so it is with ourselves : we keep coming and coming to the club until we turn into sh@@ ly@@ u@@ pi@@ ks . there !
what , the well @@@ -@@ @ known Prince Chec@@ hen@@ sky ?
he is always playing billi@@ ards , you know .
three years ago he was not yet among the sh@@ ly@@ u@@ pi@@ ks and he showed a bold front , calling others sh@@ ly@@ u@@ pi@@ ks .
well , one day he arrives , and our hall @@@ -@@ @ porter ...
well , Prince Chec@@ hen@@ sky asks him : " I say , Vasily , who is here ?
any of the sh@@ ly@@ u@@ pi@@ ks ? "
there three gentlemen were arguing about the latest political news .
'@@ Will you come , Prince ? everything is ready , ' said one of his habitual partners , finding him there , and the Prince went away .
Levin sat down for a while and listened , but remembering all the conversations he had that day heard , he suddenly felt terribly bored .
he rose hastily and went to look for O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky and T@@ uro@@ v@@ tsin , with whom he had felt mer@@ ry .
T@@ uro@@ v@@ tsin , with a tan@@ k@@ ard of something to drink , was sitting on the high sofa in the billi@@ ard @@@ -@@ @ room , and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky was talking to V@@ ron@@ sky by the door in the far corner .
'@@ She is not exactly dull , but that indefinite , un@@ settled position ... ' Levin over@@ heard , and was ha@@ st@@ ening away when O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky called him .
'@@ Levin ! ' said he ; and Levin noticed that though in O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's eyes there were not actually tears , they were mo@@ ist , as they always were when he had been drinking or when he felt touched .
to @@@ -@@ @ day it was both . ' Levin , don '@@ t go , ' he said , holding him tightly by the el@@ bow , evidently not wishing to let him go on any account .
'@@ Well , then there 's nothing for it but to kiss and be friends ! ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , good @@@ -@@ @ nat@@ ure@@ dly j@@ esting and holding out his hand .
he quickly grasped Levin 's out@@ stretched hand and pressed it .
'@@ And I am glad too , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky .
but in spite of O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's wish and theirs they had nothing to say to one another , and both knew it .
'@@ You know , he is not acquainted with Anna , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky to V@@ ron@@ sky . ' and I particularly wish to take him to see her .
'@@ Re@@ ally ? ' said V@@ ron@@ sky . ' she will be very glad .
I would go home at once , but I am anxious about Y@@ ash@@ vin and want to stay here till he has finished . '
'@@ He keeps on losing and I alone can restrain him . '
Levin , will you play ?
Oh , capital , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . ' place the balls for pyram@@ ids , ' he added , turning to the billi@@ ard @@@ -@@ @ marker .
after the game V@@ ron@@ sky and Levin joined Gag@@ in at his table , and at O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's invitation Levin began betting on aces .
he was glad the hostility between V@@ ron@@ sky and himself was ended , and the impression of tranqu@@ ill@@ ity , decor@@ um , and pleasure did not leave him .
when they had finished their play O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky took Levin 's arm .
'@@ Well then , let us go to Anna 's .
I promised her long ago to bring you .
'@@ Capital ! let 's go ! ...
find out whether my carriage has come , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky to a foot@@ man .
'@@ the O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky carriage ! ' shouted the hall @@@ -@@ @ porter in a stern bass .
but O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky would not let him reflect , and as if gu@@ essing his doubts tried to dis@@ pel them .
'@@ How glad I am that you will make her acquaintance , ' said he .
'@@ Do you know , Dol@@ ly has long wished it : and L@@ vo@@ v called on her and goes to see her .
though she is my sister , ' O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky continued , ' I may safely say that she is a remarkable woman .
well , you 'll see !
'@@ Why especially just now ? '
'@@ We are negotiating with her husband about a divorce .
he agrees ; but there are difficulties about their son , and the affair , which should have been ended long ago , has already been dragging on for three months .
as soon as she gets the divorce she will marry V@@ ron@@ sky .
'@@ What is the difficulty ? ' asked Levin .
'@@ Oh , that is a long and ti@@ res@@ ome story !
everything is so indefinite in this country .
to the left , in the side street opposite the church ! ' shouted O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , leaning out of the carriage window .
'@@ i think you see in every woman only a female , une cou@@ ve@@ use ! [ a bro@@ o@@ dy hen . ] necessarily occupied with children if at all ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ no ! I believe Anna is bringing her up splen@@ di@@ dly , but one does not hear about her .
her occupations are , firstly , writing .
I can see you smiling sar@@ cas@@ tically , but you are wrong !
she is writing a children 's book and does not speak of it to anyone , but she read it to me and I showed the manuscript to Vor@@ ku@@ yev ... You know , the publisher ... he writes himself , I think .
he is an expert , and says it is a remarkable work .
but you think she is a woman author ?
she is first of all a woman with a heart , you 'll see !
she now has a little English girl , and a whole family she is interested in . '
'@@ Why , is it a philanthrop@@ ic undertaking ? '
'@@ There you are ! at once looking out for something bad !
they had - I mean , V@@ ron@@ sky had - an English trainer , a master in his own line , but a drun@@ k@@ ard .
he took completely to drink , got deli@@ ri@@ um trem@@ ens , and has deserted his family .
but you 'll see her . '
without asking the porter who opened the door whether Anna was in , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky entered the hall .
Levin followed , more and more in doubt as to whether he was acting well or badly .
gl@@ ancing in the mirror , Levin saw that he was red in the face , but he was sure he was not ti@@ p@@ sy , and he followed O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky up the car@@ pet@@ ed stairs .
on the top landing a foot@@ man bowed to O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky as to some one he knew well , and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , asking who was with Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna , received the answer that it was Mr. Vor@@ ku@@ yev .
passing through a small dining @@@ -@@ @ room , pan@@ elled in dark wood , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky and Levin entered the study across the soft carpet . it was lit by a lamp with a large dark shade .
another refl@@ ector @@@ -@@ @ lamp fixed to the wall illuminated a large full @@@ -@@ @ length portrait of a woman which attracted Levin 's involun@@ tary attention .
it was Anna 's portrait painted in Italy by Mikha@@ y@@ lov .
he forgot where he was , and without listening to what was being said gaz@@ ed fix@@ edly at the wonderful portrait .
the only thing that showed she was not alive was that she was more beautiful than a living woman could be .
'@@ i am so glad , ' he heard a voice saying near by , evidently addressing him , the voice of the very woman whom he had admired in the portrait .
in reality she was less brilliant , but there was something about her new and attractive which was not in the portrait .
she H@@ AD R@@ IS@@ EN TO G@@ RE@@ ET H@@ IM , not conce@@ aling her pleasure at seeing him .
'@@ How are you to @@@ -@@ @ day ? ' asked her brother .
nerves as usual ! '
'@@ Is@@ n '@@ t it wonder@@ fully good ? ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , noticing that Levin kept looking at the portrait .
'@@ And it 's a wonderful lik@@ eness , is@@ n '@@ t it ? ' asked Vor@@ ku@@ yev .
a special brightness lit up Anna 's face when she felt his eyes on her .
Levin fl@@ ushed , and to hide his confusion was about to ask her if it was long since she had seen Dol@@ ly , but at that instant Anna herself began to speak .
'@@ We were just talking with Ivan Pet@@ rovich [ Vor@@ ku@@ yev . ] about V@@ ash@@ chenko 's last pictures .
have you seen them ? '
'@@ But excuse me , I interrupted you ? you were going to say ... '
'@@ She was here yesterday . she is very angry with the High School because of G@@ ris@@ ha .
the Latin master , it seems , has been unjust to him . '
Levin did not now speak at all in the matter @@@ -@@ @ of @@@ -@@ @ fact way in which he had talked that morning .
every word of his conversation with her assumed a special importance .
it was pleasant to speak to her and yet more pleasant to listen to her ,
Anna not only talked naturally and cl@@ ever@@ ly , but cl@@ ever@@ ly and ca@@ relessly , not attribu@@ ting any value to her own ideas , but attribu@@ ting great value to those of her interloc@@ utor .
Levin said the French had carried conv@@ enti@@ on@@ ality in art further than anyone else , and therefore attributed special merit to a return to realism .
in the fact that they had left off lying they perceived poetry .
never had any clever thought uttered by Levin given him so much satisfaction as this .
Anna 's face bri@@ ghtened all over when she suddenly appreciated the remark .
'@@ i am laughing as one laughs on seeing a very striking lik@@ eness !
what you have said quite characterizes present @@@ -@@ @ day French art , painting and even literature : Z@@ ola , Dau@@ de@@ t .
'@@ Yes ; that 's it exactly , ' said Vor@@ ku@@ yev .
'@@ So you have been to the club ? ' she said , addressing her brother .
'@@ What a woman ! ' thought Levin , and , quite forgetting himself , he gaz@@ ed fix@@ edly at her beautiful mobile face , which had now suddenly quite changed .
Levin did not hear what she was speaking about while she leaned toward her brother but was struck by the change in her expression .
after being so lovely in its tranqu@@ ill@@ ity , her face suddenly expressed a strange curiosity , anger , and pride .
but this lasted only a moment .
she scre@@ wed up her eyes , as if she were remembering something .
'@@ However , that won '@@ t interest anyone , ' she said ; and turning to the little English girl , she added in English , ' Please order tea in the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room . '
the child rose and went out .
'@@ Well , has she passed her examination ? ' inqui@@ red O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ You 'll finish by being fon@@ der of her than of your own . '
there is no more or less in love .
I went several times .
they are very nice children , but I could not attach myself to the work .
you mention energy ...
and her smile and glance told him that she was speaking for him alone , valu@@ ing his opinion and knowing in advance that they would understand one another .
'@@ Yes , I quite understand , ' Levin replied . ' it is impossible to put one 's heart into a school or an institution of that kind , and I think that is just why philanthrop@@ ic establishments always give such poor results . '
after a pause she smiled and said , ' Yes , yes , I never could do it .
'@@ How did you defend me ? '
'@@ That varied with the attacks .
'@@ Let me have it , Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna , ' said Vor@@ ku@@ yev , pointing to the book . ' it is well worth it . '
'@@ Oh no , it is so unfinished ! '
'@@ i have told him about it , ' remarked O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky to his sister , indicating Levin .
my writings are something like those little bas@@ kets and car@@ vings made in prisons , which Lisa Mer@@ kal@@ ova used to sell to me .
and Levin perceived yet another feature in this woman whom he already liked so much .
in addition to her intelligence , grace , and beauty , she also possessed sincerity .
she did not wish to hide from him the hardships of her position .
when she had finished speaking she sigh@@ ed , and all at once her face assumed a stern expression and became rigid .
Levin again looked at the portrait and at her figure as , arm @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ arm with her brother , she passed through the lofty doorway , and he felt a ten@@ derness and pity for her which surprised him .
she asked Levin and Vor@@ ku@@ yev to pass on into the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room , and herself remained behind to speak to her brother . ' about the divorce ?
about me ? ' Levin wondered ; and he was so excited about what she might be saying to O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky that he hardly listened to what Vor@@ ku@@ yev was telling him about the merits of Anna 's story for children .
over their tea they continued the same kind of pleasant and interesting talk .
it seemed to Levin that all that was said , not only by her , but also by Vor@@ ku@@ yev and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , assumed a special importance owing to her attention and remarks .
while following this interesting conversation Levin all the time continued to admire her : her beauty , her cl@@ ever@@ ness ; her good education , together with her simplicity and sincerity .
he listened and talked , and all the time thought of her , of her inner life , trying to guess her feelings .
and he , who had formerly judged her so severely , now by some strange process of reasoning justified her and at the same time p@@ iti@@ ed her and feared that V@@ ron@@ sky did not fully understand her .
toward eleven , when O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky rose to leave ( Vor@@ ku@@ yev had already gone ) , Levin felt as if he had only just arrived .
he got up regre@@ tfully .
'@@ Good @@@ -@@ @ bye ! ' she said , retaining his hand and gaz@@ ing at him with a look that drew him to her . ' I am very pleased que la gl@@ ace est ro@@ mp@@ ue . ' [ that the ice is broken . ]
'@@ Tell your wife that I am just as fond of her as ever and that if she C@@ AN@@ NOT forgive me my situation , I wish her never to forgive me .
to forgive , she would have to live through what I have lived through , and may God preserve her from that ! '
'@@ Cer@@ tain@@ ly , yes , I will tell her ... ' said Levin , bl@@ ushing .
'@@ WH@@ AT A wonderful , sweet , pathetic W@@ O@@ M@@ AN ! ' he thought as he and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky went out into the fro@@ sty air .
did@@ n '@@ t I tell you ? ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , who saw that Levin had been entirely van@@ qu@@ ished .
'@@ Yes , ' responded Levin pen@@ sively , ' an extraordinary woman !
not on account of her intellect , but her wonderful sincerity ...
'@@ God willing , everything will now soon be settled !
well , another time , don '@@ t judge in advance , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , opening the door of his carriage . ' good @@@ -@@ @ bye !
at home he heard from Kuz@@ ma that Kit@@ ty was well and that her sisters had not long been gone , and he was given two letters .
these he read in the ante @@@ -@@ @ room , so as not to let them divert his attention later on .
the other letter was from his sister , who repro@@ ached him for not having settled her business yet .
'@@ Well , we 'll sell it at five @@@ -@@ @ and @@@ -@@ @ a @@@ -@@ @ half , if they won '@@ t give more . ' Levin promptly settled the first matter with great ease , though it had previously appeared to him so difficult .
'@@ It 's surprising how all one 's time gets taken up here , ' he thought with reference to the second letter .
he felt himself to blame because he had not yet done what his sister asked of him .
'@@ To @@@ -@@ @ day again I did not go to the Court , but to @@@ -@@ @ day I really had no time . '
and resolving that he would attend to it next day without fail , he went to his wife .
on his way he ran over in his mind the whole of the past day .
all the events had consisted of conversations : conversations to which he had listened or in which he had taken part .
all these conversations were about matters he would never have occupied himself with had he been in the country , but here they were very interesting .
all of them had been good , and only two things were not quite pleasant .
one was what he had said about the pi@@ ke , and the other was that there was something not quite right about his tender pity for Anna .
Levin found his wife sad and depressed .
the three sisters ' dinner @@@ -@@ @ party would have gone off very well , except that he did not come in as they expected and they all became dull . then the sisters left , and she remained alone .
'@@ Well , and what have you been doing ? ' she asked , looking him in the eyes , which had a suspicious glit@@ ter in them .
but , not to hinder his relating everything , she masked her observation and listened with an appreci@@ ative smile while he told her how he had spent the evening .
'@@ i was very pleased to meet V@@ ron@@ sky .
I felt quite at ease and quite natural with him .
but Kit@@ ty was not interested in the question of how the people drink ; she had seen his bl@@ ush and wanted to know the reason .
'@@ Well , and where did you go then ? '
on saying this Levin bl@@ ushed still more , and his doubts as to whether he had done right or wrong in going to see Anna were finally solved .
he now knew that he should not have gone there .
Kit@@ ty 's eyes opened in a peculiar manner and fl@@ ashed at the mention of Anna 's name , but making an effort she hid her agitation and so deceived him .
'@@ ah ! ' was all she said ..
'@@ i am sure you won '@@ t be angry with me for going .
'@@ Oh no ! ' she said , but he saw by her eyes the effort she made to control herself , and it bo@@ ded him no good .
'@@ She is very charming , very , very much to be p@@ iti@@ ed , and a good woman , ' he said , telling her about Anna and her occupations and the message she had sent .
'@@ Yes , of course she is much to be p@@ iti@@ ed , ' said Kit@@ ty when he had finished . ' from whom were your letters ? '
he told her , and mis@@ led by her quiet manner went to und@@ ress .
when he drew near she looked at him and burst into so@@ bs .
'@@ You have fallen in love with that hor@@ rid woman ! she has be@@ wit@@ ched you !
I saw it in your eyes .
what can come of it ?
you were at the club drinking and drinking , and gambling , and then you went ... to whom ?
it was long before Levin could paci@@ fy his wife .
one thing that he sincerely confessed was that , living so long in Moscow with nothing but talk and food and drink , he was going silly .
they talked till three in the morning , and only then were they sufficiently reconciled to fall asleep .
when H@@ ER V@@ IS@@ IT@@ OR@@ S H@@ AD taken TH@@ E@@ IR LE@@ AV@@ E Anna did not sit down , but began pac@@ ing up and down the room .
one thought , and one only , pursued her remor@@ sel@@ essly in different forms .
why has he been away all the evening ?
he sent word by Steve that he could not leave Y@@ ash@@ vin , but must keep an eye on his play .
is Y@@ ash@@ vin such a child ?
he is glad of a chance to show me that he has other obligations .
I know he has , I agree to that .
but why prove it to me ?
he wishes to give me proof@@ s that his love of me must not interfere with his freedom .
he ought to understand the hardship of my life here in Moscow .
I do not live , but only wait for a solution which is deferred and still deferred .
and Steve says he can '@@ t go to see Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich ; and I can '@@ t write again .
he ought to pity me , ' said she , feeling tears of self @@@ -@@ @ compassion rising to her eyes .
she heard V@@ ron@@ sky 's ve@@ h@@ ement ring at the front door and quickly dried her eyes . she even sat down near the lamp and opened a book , pretending to be tran@@ qui@@ l .
she must let him see that she was dis@@ pleased that he had not returned when he had promised - dis@@ pleased , that should be all ; she would on no account show him her grief , and still less her self @@@ -@@ @ compassion .
she might pity herself , but he must not pity her .
she did not want strife and blamed him for wanting to fight , but yet she involun@@ tarily took up a fighting attitude .
'@@ Well , you 've not been dull ? ' he asked cheer@@ fully and with animation , coming up to her . ' what a terrible passion gambling is ! '
'@@ no , I have not been dull , I have long ago learnt not to feel dull .
'@@ Yes , I knew they were coming to see you .
and how did you like Levin ? ' he asked , taking a seat beside her .
'@@ Very much .
'@@ He was lucky and won seventeen thousand .
I called him away and very nearly got him to come .
'@@ Then what was the good of your staying with him ? ' she said , suddenly raising her eyes to his face .
her look was cold and hostile . ' you told Steve you were staying to bring Y@@ ash@@ vin away , but you have left him . '
a similar cold expression of readiness for strife appeared on his face .
she was pleased by this appeal to ten@@ derness .
but some strange evil power prevented her from yielding to her impulse , as if the conditions of the struggle did not allow her to submit .
'@@ of course you wished to stay , and stayed .
you always do what you wish .
but why tell me ?
why ? ' she said , becoming more and more ag@@ itated . ' does anyone dispute your right ?
his hand closed , he leaned back , and his face assumed a still more stubborn look .
'@@ But what is it all about ? ' he said , horri@@ fied at her expression of despair , and again leaning toward her he took her hand and kis@@ sed it . ' what have I done ?
'@@ Well then , tell me what I should do to make you easy ?
'@@ No@@ thing , nothing ! ' she replied . ' I don '@@ t know myself whether it is this lonely life , or nerves ...
but don '@@ t let 's talk about it !
what about the races ? you haven '@@ t told me about them , ' and she tried to hide her triumph at her victory , for the victory was hers after all .
she felt that side by side with the love that united them there had grown up some evil spirit of strife , which she could not cast out of his heart and still less out of her own .
there ARE NO CON@@ D@@ IT@@ IONS OF LIF@@ E to which a man C@@ AN@@ NOT accu@@ stom himself , especially if he sees that every one around him lives in the same way .
but under the influence of wear@@ iness , a sle@@ e@@ pless night , and the wine he had drunk , he slept s@@ oundly and peacefully .
he jumped up and looked round .
but on the other side of the partition a light was moving , and he heard her step .
'@@ No@@ thing , ' said she , coming candle in hand from beyond the partition . ' I only felt a little un@@ well , ' she added with a peculi@@ arly sweet and significant smile .
'@@ What ? has it begun ? has it ? ' he asked in a frightened voice . ' we must send ... ' And he began to dress hur@@ ri@@ edly .
'@@ no , no , ' she said smiling , holding him back with her hand .
'@@ i 'm sure it 's nothing .
she came back to her bed , put out the candle , lay down , and remained quiet .
at seven o 'clock he was awakened by her touch on his shoulder and a soft whis@@ per .
she seemed to hesitate between regret at waking him and a desire to speak to him .
'@@ Ko@@ st@@ ya , don '@@ t be frightened .
we must send for Mary Vl@@ as@@ evna . '
the candle was burning again .
she was sitting on the bed holding in her hands some knit@@ ting she had lately been doing .
'@@ Please don '@@ t be frightened ! it 's nothing .
I 'm not a bit afraid , ' she said on seeing his al@@ armed face , and she pressed his hand to her breast and then to her lips .
it was necessary for him to go , but he could not tear himself away from the sight of her : he had loved that face and known all its expressions and looks , but he had never seen her as she was now .
how v@@ ile and des@@ pic@@ able he appeared to himself before her as she now was , when he recoll@@ ected the grief he had caused her yesterday !
her fl@@ ushed face surrounded with soft hair that had escaped from beneath her night @@@ -@@ @ cap shone with joy and resolution .
and in this simplicity , this n@@ ak@@ edness of soul , she whom he loved was more apparent than ever .
she looked at him smil@@ ingly , but suddenly her eyebrows t@@ wit@@ ched , she raised her head , and coming quickly to him she took hold of his hand and cl@@ inging close she envelop@@ ed him in her hot breath .
she was suffering and seemed to be complaining to him of her pain .
and for a moment from force of habit he felt as if he were in fault .
but her look expressed a ten@@ derness which told him that she not only did not blame him , but loved him because of those sufferings .
'@@ If I am not to blame for it , who is ? ' he thought , involun@@ tarily seeking a cul@@ pri@@ t to punish for these sufferings ; but there was no cul@@ pri@@ t .
she suffered , complained , triumph@@ ed in her sufferings , rejo@@ iced in them and loved them .
he saw that something beautiful was taking place in her soul but what it was he could not understand .
it was above his comprehension .
'@@ i have sent for M@@ ama .
and you , go quickly and fetch Mary Vl@@ as@@ evna ...
'@@ Well , go now . P@@ asha is coming .
and Levin saw with amaz@@ ement that she again took up the knit@@ ting which she had fetched in the night , and recomm@@ enced work .
as Levin went out at one door he heard the maid enter at the other .
he stopped at the door and heard Kit@@ ty give detailed instructions to the maid , and with her help herself move the bed .
he dressed , and while the horse was being harn@@ essed - for it was early , and no iz@@ v@@ osh@@ chi@@ ks were about yet - he ran back to the bedroom not on ti@@ pto@@ e but , as it seemed to him , on wings .
two m@@ aids were busy moving something in the bedroom .
'@@ i am going straight to the doctor 's .
they have already gone for Mary Vl@@ as@@ evna , but I will call there too .
'@@ Yes , yes ! go , ' she said rapidly , fro@@ w@@ ning and mo@@ tioning him away with her hand .
he stopped and for a moment could not understand it .
'@@ Yes , it was she , ' he said and , cl@@ as@@ ping his head with his hands , he ran down@@ stairs .
'@@ Lord have mercy ! pardon and help us ! ' he repeated the word@@ s. that suddenly and unexpectedly sprang to his lips .
and he , an un@@ believer , repeated those words not with his lips only .
at that instant he knew that neither his doubts nor the impossibility of believing with his reason - of which he was conscious - all prevented his appealing to God .
to whom should he appeal , if not to Him in whose hands he felt himself , his soul , and his love , to be ?
in the little sle@@ dge sat Mary Vl@@ as@@ evna in a vel@@ vet cloak with a sha@@ w@@ l over her head .
'@@ Than@@ k God ! ' he mut@@ tered , recognizing with delight her little bl@@ onde face , which now wore a particularly serious and even severe expression .
without stopping the iz@@ v@@ osh@@ chik he ran back beside her .
'@@ So it began about two hours ago , not more ? ' she asked . ' you will find the doctor , but don '@@ t hurry him .
'@@ So you think it may go all right ?
God have mercy and help us ! ' said Levin as he saw his horse coming out of the gateway .
jumping into the sle@@ dge beside Kuz@@ ma , he ordered him to drive to the doctor 's .
the man was cleaning lamp @@@ -@@ @ glasses and seemed quite absorbed in his task .
'@@ Do not hurry and do not om@@ it anything , ' he said to himself , conscious of an increasing u@@ pli@@ ft of his physical powers and of his attention to all that lay before him .
this was more than Levin could stand ; he resolutely s@@ nat@@ ched the bottle out of the man 's hands and rushed out at the big glass door .
the doctor was not up yet , and the foot@@ man , now busy putting down a carpet , refused to wake him .
Levin could hear the doctor at the other side of the door c@@ ough@@ ing , walking about , washing , and speaking .
some three minutes el@@ ap@@ sed ; to Levin they seemed more than an hour .
he could not wait any longer .
'@@ Peter Dmit@@ rich ! Peter Dmit@@ rich ! ' he called out in a tone of ent@@ reat@@ y through the open door .
'@@ For heaven 's sake forgive me ! ...
'@@ Im@@ medi@@ ately ! immediately ! ' answered a voice , and Levin was ast@@ ounded to detect that the doctor was smiling as he said it .
'@@ Im@@ medi@@ ately ! '
two minutes more passed while the doctor put on his boots and two more while he put on his clothes and br@@ ushed his hair .
'@@ Peter Dmit@@ rich ! ' Levin again began in a pit@@ eous voice , but at that instant the doctor came out , dressed and with his hair br@@ ushed .
'@@ These people have no conscience , ' thought Levin . ' br@@ ushing their hair while we are per@@ ishing . '
'@@ Good morning ! ' said the doctor , holding out his hand and , as it seemed to Levin , te@@ asing him by his calm manner . ' Don '@@ t hurry !
trying to be as exact as possible , Levin began recoun@@ ting every unnecessary detail of his wife 's position , continually interrup@@ ting himself to beg the doctor to accompany him at once .
'@@ Don '@@ t be in such a hurry .
you see you are inexperienced , I am sure I shall not be needed , but I promised , and if you like I will come .
please sit down . won '@@ t you have a cup of coffee ? '
Levin gave the doctor a look which asked whether he was not laughing at him .
but the doctor had no idea of laughing .
'@@ i know , I know , ' he said with a smile . ' I am a family man myself .
'@@ But what is your opinion , Peter Dmit@@ rich ?
do you think it may go all right ? '
'@@ all the symptoms are favourable . '
'@@ Then you will come at once ? ' said Levin , looking an@@ gr@@ ily at the servant who brought in the coffee .
'@@ Well , the Turks are being seriously beaten !
did you read yesterday 's tel@@ eg@@ ram ? ' asked the doctor , chew@@ ing a piece of roll .
'@@ no , I can '@@ t stand it ! ' said Levin , jumping up . ' so you will come in a quarter of an hour ? '
'@@ on your honour ? '
Levin got home just as the Princess arrived , and they met at the bedroom door .
there were tears in the Princess 's eyes and her hands shook .
'@@ Well , Mary Vl@@ as@@ evna , dar@@ ling ? ' she asked , seizing the hand of the mid@@ wife who came toward them with a be@@ aming but preoccupied expression .
and only one hour had passed !
but the minutes went by , and the hours , and other hours , and his suffering and terror and strain grew ten@@ ser .
the ordinary conditions of life , without which nothing can be imagined , no longer existed for Levin .
he was surprised when Mary Vl@@ as@@ evna asked him to light a candle behind the partition , and he learnt that it was already five o 'clock in the evening .
had he been told it was ten in the morning he would not have been more astonished .
he had just as little idea of where he was at that time as he had of when it all took place .
he saw her burning face , now bewil@@ dered and full of suffering , and now smiling and soo@@ thing him .
but he did not know how they came and went , nor where they were .
he did it with zeal , believing that it was necessary for her sake , and only later discovered that he had been preparing a sleeping @@@ -@@ @ place for himself .
then he was sent to the study to ask the doctor about something .
but where , when , and why all this was done he did not know .
he only knew and felt that what was happening was similar to what had happened the year before in the hotel of the provincial town on the de@@ ath@@ bed of his brother Nicholas .
only that was sorrow and this was joy .
but that sorrow and this joy were equally beyond the usual conditions of life : they were like openings in that usual life through which something higher became visible .
during the whole of that time he was alter@@ nat@@ ely in two different moods .
but when , looking at her , he again saw that to help was impossible ; he was seized with horror and said , ' Lord , pardon and help us ! '
he would jump up , wishing to run away somewhere , but ran to her instead .
sometimes when she had called him again and again , he was half @@@ -@@ @ inclined to blame her .
but seeing her me@@ ek smiling face and hearing her say , ' I have worn you out , ' he blamed God ; but the thought of God made him at once pray for forgiveness and mercy .
Dol@@ ly had just entered the study and suggested that the doctor should lie down .
it was an interval of rest and obli@@ vion .
he had quite forgotten what was going on .
the scream was so terrible that Levin did not even jump up , but looked breath@@ lessly with a frightened and inqu@@ iring glance at the doctor , who bent his head on one side to listen and smiled appro@@ v@@ ingly .
everything was so out of the ordinary that nothing any longer surprised Levin .
'@@ Prob@@ ably it had to be so , ' thought he and remained sitting still .
'@@ But who was it screaming ? '
he jumped up and rushed into the bedroom on ti@@ pto@@ e , past Mary Vl@@ as@@ evna and the Princess , and stopped at his place at the head of the bed .
Kit@@ ty 's burning face , worn with suffering , with a lock of hair cl@@ inging to her clam@@ my forehead , was turned toward him trying to catch his eye .
her raised hands asked for his .
seizing his cold hands in her per@@ spir@@ ing ones she pressed them to her face .
I am not afraid , I am not afraid ! ' she said rapidly . ' M@@ ama !
you are not afraid ?
she spoke very rapidly and tried to smile , but all at once her face became distorted and she pushed him away .
'@@ no , this is awful !
go ! go ! ' she cried , and again he heard that scream unlike any other cry .
'@@ It 's all right , it 's all right ! all goes well ! ' Dol@@ ly called after him .
but say what they might , he knew that now all was lost .
leaning his head against the door @@@ -@@ @ post he stood in the next room , and heard some one shri@@ e@@ king and mo@@ aning in a way he had never heard till then , and he knew that these sounds were produced by what once was Kit@@ ty .
he had long ceased wishing for a child , and now he hated that child .
he did not now even wish her to live , but only long@@ ed that these terrible sufferings should end .
'@@ Doctor , what is it ?
what is it ?
'@@ It 's coming to an end , ' said the doctor , with a face so serious that Levin thought that end meant death .
quite beside himself , he rushed into her room .
the first thing he saw was Mary Vl@@ as@@ evna 's face .
it was still more fro@@ w@@ ning and stern .
Kit@@ ty 's face did not exist .
in its place was something terrible , both because of its strained expression and because of the sounds which proceeded from it .
he let his head drop upon the wood of the bed@@ stead , feeling that his heart was breaking .
the terrible screaming did not cease , but grew yet more awful until , as if it had reached the utmost limit of horror , it suddenly ceased .
with her arms hel@@ pl@@ essly out@@ stretched upon the qu@@ ilt , unusually beautiful and calm she lay , gaz@@ ing silently at him , trying un@@ successfully to smile .
the t@@ aut strings sn@@ apped , and so@@ bs and tears of joy that he had not in the least anticipated arose within him , with such force that they shook his whole body and long prevented his speaking .
falling on his knees by her bed@@ side he held his wife 's hand to his lips , kis@@ sing it , and that hand , by a fee@@ ble movement of the fingers , replied to the kis@@ ses .
and a boy !
Don '@@ t be anxious , ' Levin heard Mary Vl@@ as@@ evna say , as she sl@@ apped the baby 's back with a shaking hand .
the Princess could only so@@ b in reply .
and amid the silence , as a positive answer to the mother 's question , a voice quite unlike all the restrained voices that had been speaking in the room made itself heard .
Kit@@ ty was alive , her sufferings were over ; and he was full of un@@ spe@@ ak@@ able bliss .
this he compreh@@ ended , and it rendered him entirely happy .
but the child ?
who was he ? ... He could not at all accu@@ stom himself to the idea .
it seemed something super@@ flu@@ ous , something over@@ flowing , and for a long time he was unable to get used to it .
toward TE@@ N O '@@ C@@ LO@@ C@@ K the old Prince , Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky were with Levin , and having talked about the young mother they had begun discussing other matters .
Levin listened to them and at the same time involun@@ tarily thought of the past and of what had been going on before that morning , remembering himself as he had been yesterday before this event .
a hundred years seemed to have el@@ ap@@ sed since then .
he felt as if he were on some un@@ attainable height , from which he pain@@ stak@@ ingly descended in order not to hurt the feelings of those with whom he was convers@@ ing .
he talked but never ceased thinking of his wife , of the details of her present condition , and of his son - to the idea of whose existence he pain@@ stak@@ ingly tried to accu@@ stom himself .
that feminine world which since his marriage had received a new and un@@ suspected significance for him now rose so high in his estimation that his imagination could not grasp it .
he heard a conversation about yesterday 's dinner at the club and thought , ' What is happening to her now ? is she asleep ?
how is she ?
is our son , Dmitry , crying ? '
'@@ Send and let me know whether I may see her , ' said the old Prince .
'@@ all right , directly ! ' answered Levin , and , without pa@@ using , went to her room .
she was not asleep , but was talking quietly with her mother , making plans for the ch@@ rist@@ ening .
made neat , her hair br@@ ushed , a smart cap trim@@ med with something blue on her head , she lay on her back with her arms outside the qu@@ ilt , and met his look with a look which drew him toward her .
again an agitation , similar to that which he had felt at the moment of the birth , gri@@ pped his heart .
he could not answer and , conscious of his weakness , turned away .
'@@ And I have been do@@ zing , Ko@@ st@@ ya ! ' she said . ' and now I feel so comfortable . '
she was gaz@@ ing at him , but suddenly her face changed .
'@@ Let me have him , ' said she , hearing the baby 's cry . ' let me have him , Mary Vl@@ as@@ evna , and he will see him too ! '
Levin , gaz@@ ing at this tiny pit@@ eous being , v@@ ain@@ ly searched his soul for some indications of pat@@ er@@ nal feeling .
he felt nothing for it but re@@ pulsion .
Mary Vl@@ as@@ evna laughed .
when the baby had been sw@@ add@@ led and made into a firm doll , Mary Vl@@ as@@ evna turned it over as if proud of her work , and stepped aside that Levin might see his son in all his beauty .
Kit@@ ty turned her eyes and gaz@@ ed fix@@ edly in the same direction . ' let me have him , let me have him ! ' she said , and was even going to raise herself .
'@@ What are you doing , Catherine Alexand@@ rov@@ na ? you must not move like that !
let 's show Pap@@ a what a fine fellow we are ! '
and Mary Vl@@ as@@ evna held out to Levin on one hand ( the other merely supporting the n@@ ape of the sha@@ ky head ) this strange , lim@@ p , red creature , that hid its head in its sw@@ add@@ ling clothes .
but there was also a nose , bl@@ inking eyes , and sm@@ acking lips .
'a beautiful baby ! ' said Mary Vl@@ as@@ evna .
Levin sigh@@ ed bit@@ terly .
this beautiful baby only inspired him with a sense of re@@ pulsion and pity .
these were not at all the feelings he had expected .
he turned away while Mary Vl@@ as@@ evna laid the child to the un@@ accustomed breast .
'@@ Well , that 's enough ! that 's enough ! ' said Mary Vl@@ as@@ evna ; but Kit@@ ty would not part with the baby .
'@@ Now look at him , ' said Kit@@ ty , turning him so that Levin could see him .
the old @@@ -@@ @ looking little face wrink@@ led up still more and the baby sne@@ ezed .
smiling , and hardly able to keep back tears of ten@@ derness , Levin kis@@ sed his wife and qu@@ itted the dark@@ ened room .
what he felt toward this little creature was not at all what he had anticipated .
there was nothing mer@@ ry or joyful in it ; on the contrary , there was a new and dist@@ ressing sense of fear .
it was the consciousness of another vulnerable region .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 'S affairs W@@ ERE IN A bad ST@@ ATE .
two @@@ -@@ @ thirds of the money for the forest had already been spent , and by allowing a discount of ten per cent he had obtained from the merchant almost the whole of the last third .
the position had certainly been a very good one a few years ago , but it was so no longer .
S@@ venti@@ tsky , Director of a Company , got R@@ s.@@ 17 , OOO ; and M@@ iti@@ n , having founded a bank , got R@@ s.@@ 5@@ o , OOO .
like all such posts it required such immense knowledge and activity as could hardly be united in one man .
and as there was no one found who united those qualities , it was at any rate better for the post to be filled by an honest rather than a dishonest man .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky moved in those Moscow circles where that word was used , and was there considered an honest man , so that he had a better claim to the post than other people .
the post carried a salary of from seven to ten thousand roubles a year , and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky could hold it without re@@ signing his official position .
it depended on two Ministers , one lady , and two Jews ; and though they had already been prepared it was necessary for O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky to see all these people in Petersburg .
moreover , he had promised his sister Anna to obtain a decisive answer about the divorce from K@@ aren@@ in .
so , having got fifty roubles from Dol@@ ly , he went to Petersburg .
sitting in K@@ aren@@ in 's study and listening to his article on ' The Ca@@ uses of the Bad State of Russian Finance , ' O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky only waited for him to conclude to speak about his own affairs and about Anna .
'@@ Yes , but I bring forward another principle which embraces the principle of freedom , ' said K@@ aren@@ in , accent@@ u@@ ating the word ' embraces , ' and putting his P@@ ince @@@ -@@ @ Ne@@ z on again to re @@@ -@@ @ read the part where this was said .
turning over the beautifully written , very broad @@@ -@@ @ marg@@ ined manuscript , K@@ aren@@ in re @@@ -@@ @ read the convincing passage :
K@@ aren@@ in was silent , though@@ tfully turning over the leaves of his manuscript .
the name of the post that was so near his heart was already familiar to O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky and he pronounced it rapidly without any bl@@ under .
K@@ aren@@ in inqui@@ red what was the work of this new Committee , and pon@@ dered .
he was considering whether in the activity of this Committee there was not something at vari@@ ance with his own projects .
but as the work of the new institution was very complicated and his project covered a very extensive domain , he could not decide this immediately , and taking off his P@@ ince @@@ -@@ @ Ne@@ z said :
'@@ Cer@@ tain@@ ly I could speak to him ; but , really , why do you want the post ? '
'@@ i consider , and I have written an article on the point , that the enormous salaries paid nowadays are a symptom of the false economic position of our administration . '
'@@ Yes , but what would you have ? ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . ' let 's say a bank director gets ten thousand , - he 's worth it , you know !
or an engineer gets twenty thousand .
'@@ i consider that a salary is payment for value received and should be subject to the law of supply and demand .
this is an abuse important in itself , which has a bad effect on the State service .
I consider ... '
'@@ Yes , ' said he , ' but you will agree that a new and un@@ question@@ ably useful institution is being started .
anyway , it is a live business !
it is particularly desired that the work should be managed honestly , ' concluded O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , with an emphasis on the word .
but the Moscow meaning of ' honest ' was un@@ intel@@ ligible to K@@ aren@@ in .
'@@ Hon@@ esty is only a negative quality , ' said he .
'@@ But you would greatly obli@@ ge me , all the same , if you would put in a word - when you happen to see Pom@@ or@@ sky , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky
'@@ But it depends chiefly on Bol@@ gar@@ inov , I think , ' said K@@ aren@@ in .
'@@ Bol@@ gar@@ inov quite agrees , as far as he is concerned , ' returned O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky with a bl@@ ush .
he bl@@ ushed at the mention of Bol@@ gar@@ inov , because he had that morning been to see the Jew and the visit had left an unpleasant impression on his mind .
and when Bol@@ gar@@ inov at length received him with extreme polit@@ eness , evidently triumph@@ ing in his humiliation , and very nearly refused his request , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky ha@@ st@@ ened to forget it as quickly as he could ; and only now on recoll@@ ecting it bl@@ ushed .
'@@ NO@@ W TH@@ ERE 'S AN@@ O@@ TH@@ ER MAT@@ TER ; you know what it is ... about Anna , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky after a short pause , when he had shaken off the unpleasant recoll@@ ection .
directly O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky mentioned Anna 's name K@@ aren@@ in 's face entirely changed . instead of its former animation it expressed wear@@ iness and lif@@ elessness ..
'@@ What is it you wish of me ? ' K@@ aren@@ in said , turning round in his chair and folding his P@@ ince @@@ -@@ @ Ne@@ z .
'a decision , some decision , Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich !
you should have pity on her . '
'@@ What do you mean exactly ? ' asked K@@ aren@@ in in a low tone .
'@@ Why , pity her !
if you had seen her as I have who have spent the whole winter with her , you would pity her .
'@@ It seems to me , ' returned K@@ aren@@ in in a more high @@@ -@@ @ pit@@ ched , almost sque@@ ak@@ y voice , ' that Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna has everything she herself desired . '
'@@ Oh , Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich ! for God 's sake don '@@ t let us have any rec@@ ri@@ min@@ ations !
what is past is past ! you know what she wants and is waiting for : the divorce . '
'@@ But I understood that Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna declined a divorce if I insisted on keeping my son .
I answered in that sense and thought the matter was closed .
I consider it closed , ' shri@@ e@@ ked K@@ aren@@ in .
'@@ For heaven 's sake don '@@ t exc@@ ite yourself , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , touching his brother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law 's knee . ' the matter is not closed .
if you will let me recapit@@ ulate , this is how matters stood : when you parted , you were great , as mag@@ n@@ anim@@ ous as a man can possibly be ; you con@@ s@@ ented to everything : her freedom and even a divorce .
she appreciated it to such a degree that , at the moment , feeling herself to blame toward you , she did not consider and could not consider everything .
she ren@@ ounced everything .
but facts and time have shown that her situation is tor@@ m@@ enting and impossible . '
'@@ Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna 's life C@@ AN@@ NOT interest me , ' inter@@ posed K@@ aren@@ in , lifting his brows .
'@@ Allow me not to believe that , ' O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky re@@ joined gently . ' her situation is tor@@ m@@ enting to her and does not benefit anyone .
but I , and all her relatives , who all love her , beg and impl@@ ore you !
who gains by it ? '
'@@ Exc@@ use me ! you seem to be placing me in the position of defendant , ' K@@ aren@@ in re@@ monstr@@ ated .
I would arrange everything for you so that you would not be bothered .
'@@ the promise was given before , and I thought the question about my son had settled the matter ...
besides , I hoped that Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna would have generosity enough ... ' uttered K@@ aren@@ in with difficulty , his lips trembling and his face turning pale .
'@@ She leaves everything to your generosity !
she asks , she ple@@ ads for one thing only : help her out of the intolerable position she is in !
she no longer asks for her son ...
Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich ! you are a good man .
if you had not promised before , she would have grown reconciled to her position and have gone on living in the country .
and now in Moscow where every time she meets anyone it is like a knife in her heart , she has been living for six months every day expecting your decision .
why , it 's like keeping a man condemned to death with the hal@@ ter round his neck for months , promising him either death or a re@@ pri@@ eve !
have pity on her , and I undertake to arrange ...
'@@ i am not speaking of that ... of that ... ' K@@ aren@@ in interrupted him in a disgu@@ sted tone . ' but perhaps I promised something I had no right to promise . '
'@@ Then you refuse what you promised ? '
'@@ i have never refused to do what is possible , but I want time to consider in how far what was promised is possible . '
'@@ no , Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , jumping to his feet . ' I will not believe that !
she is as w@@ ret@@ ched as a woman can be , and you C@@ AN@@ NOT refuse such a ... '
v@@ ous prof@@ es@@ se@@ z d '@@ ê@@ tre un libr@@ e Pen@@ se@@ ur , [ You prof@@ ess to be a fre@@ e@@ thinker . ] but I , as a believer , in so important a matter C@@ AN@@ NOT act contrary to the Christian law . '
'@@ But in Christian communities , and in ours too as far as I know , divorce is permitted , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . ' divorce is also permitted by our Church .
and we see ... '
'@@ It is permitted , but not in that sense . '
'@@ Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich , I don '@@ t recognize you ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky after a pause . ' was it not you ( and did we not appreciate it ? ) who for@@ gave everything , and , moved just by Christian feeling , were ready to sacrifice everything ?
you yourself said " Gi@@ ve your coat when they would take your cloak ... " ! and now ... '
'@@ i beg , ' began K@@ aren@@ in in a shr@@ ill voice , suddenly rising to his feet , pale and with trembling jaw , ' I beg you to stop ... stop ... this conversation ! '
well then , forgive me ! forgive me if I have p@@ ained you , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky with an embarrassed smile , holding out his hand . ' I only delivered my message as an envoy . '
K@@ aren@@ in gave him his hand , reflected , and then said :
'@@ i must think it over and seek for guidance .
the day after to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row I will give you a final answer , ' he added , after consideration .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky W@@ AS J@@ UST leaving when Kor@@ ney entered and announced :
'@@ Who is Sergey Alex@@ ey@@ ich ? ' O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky was about to ask , but immediately recoll@@ ected .
he recalled the tim@@ id pathetic look with which Anna at par@@ ting from him had said : ' any@@ how , you will see him .
find out everything : where he is , who is with him .
and , Steve ... if it is possible ...
he had understood what ' If it is possible ' meant . it meant , if it is possible to arrange the divorce so that she should have her son ...
but now O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky saw that it was useless even to think of that ; he was , however , glad to see his ne@@ phe@@ w .
K@@ aren@@ in reminded his brother @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law that they never mentioned his mother to the boy , and asked him not to say a word about her .
'@@ He was very ill after that unexpected interview with his mother , ' remarked K@@ aren@@ in . ' we even feared for his life .
but sensible treatment and sea @@@ -@@ @ bathing in the summer have restored his health , and now , on the doctor 's advice , I send him to school .
the influence of his school@@ fellows has really had a good effect on him , and he is quite well and learns well . '
'@@ H@@ ul@@ lo ! what a fine fellow !
true enough , it 's not little Ser@@ ez@@ ha now , but a complete Sergey Alex@@ ey@@ ich ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , smiling as he looked at a handsome boy in a blue jacket and long trous@@ ers who entered the room boldly and confidently .
the l@@ ad looked healthy and bright .
he bowed to his uncle as to a stranger , but recognizing him he bl@@ ushed and turned away from him quickly as if offended and angry about something .
the boy came up to his father and handed him his school report .
'@@ Well , that 's pretty good , ' said his father . ' you may go now . '
'@@ He has grown thin and tall , and is no longer a child but a regular boy , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . ' I like it . do you remember me ? '
the boy glanced swiftly at his father .
'@@ i do , mon on@@ cle , ' he answered , looking at his uncle and then again lowering his eyes .
'@@ Well , how are things ? ' said he , wishing to start a conversation , but not knowing what to say .
the boy , bl@@ ushing and not answering , gently withdrew his hand from his uncle 's grasp .
as soon as O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky released it , after a questioning glance at his father , he hastily left the room like a bird let out of its cage .
a year had passed since Ser@@ ez@@ ha last saw his mother .
since then he had not heard any more of her .
during this year he had been sent to school , and had learned to know his school@@ mates and to like them .
the dreams and memories of his mother which , after their interview , had made him ill , no longer occupied him .
when they rose in his memory he took pains to drive them away , considering them shameful and fit only for girls , but not for a boy and a ch@@ um .
he knew that his father and mother had had a quarrel which separated them ; knew that it was his fate to remain with his father , and he tried to accu@@ stom himself to that thought .
he felt uncomfortable at meeting his uncle , who resem@@ bled his mother , because it awakened those very memories which he considered shameful .
'@@ We play at railways now , ' he said , answering the question . ' you see , it 's this way : two sit down on a form ; they are passengers .
the doors are opened beforehand ...
it 's not easy to be the guard ! '
'@@ That 's the one who stands up ? ' asked O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky with a smile .
'@@ Yes . it needs courage and quick@@ ness , especially if they stop suddenly , or if somebody falls down . '
'@@ Yes , that 's no joke , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , looking sadly into those animated eyes so like the mother 's - an infant 's eyes no longer , and no longer altogether innocent .
and , in spite of his promise to K@@ aren@@ in , he could not refrain from speaking of Anna .
'@@ Do you remember your mother ? ' he suddenly asked .
'@@ no , I don '@@ t ! ' hur@@ ri@@ edly replied Ser@@ ez@@ ha , and bl@@ ushing scar@@ let he hung down his head .
his uncle could get nothing more out of him .
'@@ i expect you hurt yourself when you fell down ? ' said the tutor . ' I told you it was a dangerous game .
'@@ If I had hurt myself no one would have known it , that is quite certain ! '
'@@ Leave me alone !
why should I remember ?
leave me alone ! ' he said , now addressing not his tutor but the world in general .
as W@@ AS H@@ IS won@@ t , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky did not spend his time idly while in Petersburg .
besides business - his sister 's divorce and his post - it was as usual necessary for him , as he said , to refresh himself in Petersburg after the mu@@ st@@ iness of Moscow .
Moscow , despite its caf@@ és chan@@ tants and its omni@@ buses , was still a stagnant pool .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky always felt this .
after living in Moscow , especially in the bos@@ om of his family , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky always felt his spirits flag .
only that day he had been talking to Prince Chec@@ hen@@ sky .
he had a wife and family with grown @@@ -@@ @ up sons who were pages at Court ; and another family , an illegitimate one , in which there were other children .
though the first family was all right , Prince Chec@@ hen@@ sky felt happier with the second family .
he took his el@@ dest son to visit the second family , and told O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky that he considered it developed his son and was good for him .
what would they say to that in Moscow ?
in Petersburg children did not hinder their fathers living .
children were brought up in educational establishments , and there were none of those barbar@@ ic views that were becoming so prevalent in Moscow - L@@ vo@@ v 's was a case in point - that the children should have every luxury and the parents nothing but work and worry .
here people understood that a man must live his own life like a civilized being .
service too was not here that strained , hopeless dru@@ dg@@ ery that it was in Moscow ; here there was an interest in the Service .
but it was the Petersburg outlook on money matters that had a particularly soo@@ thing effect on O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
B@@ art@@ ny@@ ansky , who spent at least fifty thousand roubles a year at the rate he was living , had the day before made a notable remark to him on the point .
as they were having a chat before dinner , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky had said to B@@ art@@ ny@@ ansky :
'@@ You are , I think , intimate with M@@ ord@@ vin@@ sky ? you could do me a good turn if you would put in a word for me .
there is a post I should like to get ...
'@@ Never mind the name , I shoul@@ d@@ n '@@ t remember it ! ... But why do you want to mix in those railway concerns , with Jews ? ...
look at it how you like , it 's hor@@ rid ! '
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky did not tell him that it was a ' live ' business . B@@ art@@ ny@@ ansky would not have understood that .
is it much ? ' asked B@@ art@@ ny@@ ansky symp@@ athe@@ tically .
'@@ Very much : about twenty thousand roubles . '
B@@ art@@ ny@@ ansky burst into mer@@ ry laughter .
'@@ Oh , you lucky fellow ! ' he cried . ' my debts amount to a million and a half , and I have nothing ! but , as you see , I still find it possible to live ! '
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky knew this to be true , not only from hear@@ say but from actual fact .
Z@@ hi@@ v@@ ak@@ hov , whose debts amounted to three hundred thousand roubles , did@@ n '@@ t possess a penny and yet he lived , and how he lived !
Pet@@ rovsky had run through five millions , continued living in just the same style , and even directed the Finance Department and received a salary of twenty thousand .
but , apart from that , Petersburg acted pleas@@ antly on O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky physically .
in Moscow he sometimes noticed some grey ha@@ irs ; fell asleep after dinner ; stretched himself ; walked slowly up@@ stairs , breathing heavily ; felt dull among young women , and did not dance at balls .
in Petersburg he always felt that he had shaken off ten years .
in Petersburg he felt what the sixty @@@ -@@ @ year @@@ -@@ @ old Prince Peter O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , who had just returned from abroad , had described to him only the day before .
I see a young woman , and my fancy ...
Stephen experienced just the same difference as Peter O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
between the Princess Bet@@ sy T@@ ver@@ skaya and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky there existed long @@@ -@@ @ established and very peculiar relations .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky in fun always paid court to her , and told her the most in@@ decent things also in fun , knowing that she liked that more than anything .
this tone had sp@@ run@@ g up between them because he was very attractive to her .
'@@ ah , so you are here ! ' she said on seeing him . ' well , how is your poor sister ?
Don '@@ t look at me like that , ' she added . ' since every one has been attacking her - all those who are a hundred thousand times worse than she - I have thought she has acted splen@@ di@@ dly .
I can '@@ t forgive V@@ ron@@ sky for not letting me know when she was in Petersburg .
I would have gone to her and with her everywhere .
please give her my love ...
'@@ Yes , her situation is a hard one ... ' O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky began , in the simplicity of his heart taking the Princess My@@ ag@@ k@@ aya 's words for genuine coin when she said ' Tell me about her . '
but the Princess My@@ ag@@ k@@ aya immediately interrupted him , as was her habit , and commenced telling her own tale .
'@@ She has done what everybody , except myself , does secretly , and she would not deceive , and has acted splen@@ di@@ dly .
excuse me .
now that he has got so ch@@ um@@ my with Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna and Land@@ au , every one says he is half @@@ -@@ @ wit@@ ted ; and I should be glad not to agree with everybody , but this time I can '@@ t help it . '
'@@ But do explain to me what it means ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ Y@@ ester@@ day I called on him about my sister 's affair and asked him for a definite answer .
'@@ ah , that 's it , that 's it ! ' Princess My@@ ag@@ k@@ aya began joy@@ fully . ' they will ask Land@@ au and see what he says . '
Land@@ au , you see , was a comm@@ is [ Shop @@@ -@@ @ assistant . ] in Paris and went to see a doctor .
he fell asleep in the doctor 's waiting @@@ -@@ @ room , and while asleep began giving advice to all the patients , and very strange advice too .
afterwards , Yury Mel@@ ed@@ insky 's wife ( the invalid 's wife , you know ) heard of that Land@@ au , and took him to see her husband .
no good has been done in my opinion , for he is still just as weak , but they believe in him and take him about with them .
so they brought him to Russia .
here every one rushed at him , and he began treating everybody .
'@@ Ad@@ opted ! how ? '
'@@ Sim@@ ply adopted him !
he is now no longer Land@@ au , but Count B@@ ez@@ zu@@ bov .
after AN excellent dinner and a large quantity of brandy at B@@ art@@ ny@@ ansky 's , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , only a little after the appointed time , entered the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna 's house .
'@@ Who is with the Countess ?
'@@ Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich K@@ aren@@ in and Count B@@ ez@@ zu@@ bov , ' the hall @@@ -@@ @ porter replied severely .
it was still quite light out of doors , but in the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna 's small drawing @@@ -@@ @ room the blin@@ ds were down and the lamp ali@@ ght .
at the round table beneath a lamp sat the Countess and K@@ aren@@ in , convers@@ ing in low tones .
after greeting the host@@ ess and K@@ aren@@ in , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky involun@@ tarily glanced at the stranger once more .
'@@ Mon@@ si@@ eur Land@@ au ! ' the Countess addressed him with a soft@@ ness and caution that struck O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
Land@@ au hur@@ ri@@ edly looked round , approached smil@@ ingly , laid upon O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's out@@ stretched hand his own mo@@ ist and mo@@ tionless one , went back , and continued looking at the portraits .
the Countess and K@@ aren@@ in glanced at each other significantly .
'@@ i am very pleased to see you , especially to @@@ -@@ @ day , ' said the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna , pointing to a seat beside K@@ aren@@ in .
'@@ i introduced him to you as Land@@ au , ' she said softly , gl@@ ancing at the French@@ man and then back at O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , ' but really he is Count B@@ ez@@ zu@@ bov , as you probably know .
but he does not like that title . '
'@@ Yes , I have heard , ' replied O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . ' they say he has completely cured the Countess B@@ ez@@ zu@@ bov . '
'@@ She called on me to @@@ -@@ @ day , and was so pathetic , ' said the Countess , turning to K@@ aren@@ in . ' this separation is dreadful for her .
it is such a blow to her ! '
'@@ is he going definitely ? ' inqui@@ red K@@ aren@@ in .
he heard a voice yesterday , ' said the Countess , with a look at O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ ah , a voice ! ' O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky remarked , feeling that he must be as careful as possible in this company , where something peculiar occurred , or was supposed to occur , to which he as yet lacked a clue .
after a mom@@ entary pause the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna , as if coming to the important point , turned with a subtle smile to O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ i have known you a long time , and am very pleased to know you more intim@@ ately .
[ the friends of our friends are our friends . ] But to be a friend , one must enter into the state of the friend 's soul , and I fear you will not do so in relation to Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich .
you understand what I am speaking about ? ' she said , lifting her beautiful dream@@ y eyes .
'@@ To some extent , Countess ! I understand that Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich 's position ... ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , not quite gras@@ ping what it was all about , and therefore wishing to keep to gener@@ alities .
'@@ Well , broadly speaking , I can picture to myself the change .
'@@ the change that has taken place in him C@@ AN@@ NOT weaken his love for his neighbour ; on the contrary , that change must strengthen his love .
won '@@ t you have some tea ? ' she said , indicating with her eyes the foot@@ man who was handing tea round on a tray .
of course his mis@@ fortune ... '
'@@ Yes , a mis@@ fortune which has turned into a great blessing , because his heart became new and is filled with Him , ' she said , gl@@ ancing at O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky with lov@@ es@@ ick eyes .
'@@ i think I might ask her to mention me to both , ' thought he .
'@@ Oh , certainly , Countess ! ' he said . ' but I think such changes are so very intimate that nobody , not even the closest friend , cares to speak about them . '
we must speak , and so help one another . '
'@@ Yes , of course , but there are such differences of conviction , and besides ... ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky with a gentle smile .
'@@ There C@@ AN@@ NOT be any differences in what concerns the holy Truth ! '
'@@ Oh no , of course not ! but ... ' and , becoming embarrassed , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky stopped short .
'@@ It seems to me he will fall asleep directly , ' said K@@ aren@@ in in a significant whis@@ per , approaching Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky turned .
noticing the looks directed toward him , he smiled a chil@@ dish@@ ly naive smile .
'@@ Take no notice of him , ' said Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna , and with an agile movement she pushed forward a chair for K@@ aren@@ in . ' I have noticed ... ' she began , when a foot@@ man entered with a note .
Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna rapidly read the note and , exc@@ using herself , with extreme rap@@ idity wrote and des@@ pat@@ ched the answer and returned to the table . ' I have noticed , ' she continued her interrupted sentence , ' that Muscov@@ ites , men especially , are most indifferent to religion . '
'@@ Oh no , Countess ! I think Muscov@@ ites have the reputation of being the most stead@@ fast believers , ' replied O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky .
'@@ But , as far as I know , you unfortunately are one of the indifferent ? ' K@@ aren@@ in remarked to him , with a weary smile .
'@@ How can one be indifferent ? ' said Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna .
'@@ i am in this respect not precisely indifferent , but rather expec@@ tant , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky with his most mol@@ lif@@ ying smile . ' I do not think that for me the time for those questions has yet come . '
K@@ aren@@ in and Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna exchanged looks .
'@@ no , not yet , I think , ' said Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna , who was watching the French@@ man 's movements .
Land@@ au rose and came up to them .
'@@ You will allow me to listen ? ' he asked .
'@@ Oh yes ! I did not wish to disturb you , ' said Ly@@ dia , looking ten@@ derly at him . ' sit down beside us . '
'@@ Only one must not shut one 's eyes , so as to deprive oneself of light , ' K@@ aren@@ in continued .
'@@ Oh , if you only knew the happiness we experience , feeling His continual presence in our souls ! ' cried the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna with a be@@ ati@@ fic smile .
'@@ You mean to say , he is prevented by sin ? ' said Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna . ' but that is a false view .
excuse me ! ' she added , gl@@ ancing at the foot@@ man who entered with another note .
'@@ Yes , but faith without works is dead , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , recalling that sentence from the cat@@ ech@@ ism , and only by a smile maintaining his independence .
'@@ How much harm has been done by a false interpretation of that passage !
nothing turns so many from the faith as that interpretation , " I have no works , and therefore C@@ AN@@ NOT have faith . "
'@@ To labour for God with works ; to save one 's soul by fasting , ' said the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna with fas@@ ti@@ dious disdain , ' those are the barbar@@ ous opinions of our monks ...
it is much simpler and easier , ' she added , looking at O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky with the same encouraging smile with which at Court she encouraged young M@@ aids of Hon@@ our who were confused by their new surroundings .
'@@ We are saved by Christ , who suffered for us .
we are saved by faith , ' K@@ aren@@ in chim@@ ed in , showing his approval of her remark by a look .
and having found the book and sat down again , she opened it . ' it is quite short .
it describes the way to acquire faith and the joy , higher than anything else on earth , with which it fills the soul .
a believer C@@ AN@@ NOT be unhappy because he is not alone .
but you will see ... ' she was about to begin reading when the foot@@ man came in again . ' Bor@@ oz@@ d@@ ina ?
you know Mary San@@ ina ?
she lost her only child .
well , and what happened ? she found this Friend , and now she thanks God for her child 's death .
that is the happiness faith gives ! '
'@@ Oh yes , it is very ... ' began O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , glad that she was going to read and give him time to get his ideas together .
'@@ no , evidently it will be better not to ask for anything to @@@ -@@ @ night , ' he reflected ; ' only let me get away from here without making a mess of things ! '
'@@ It will be dull for you , ' said the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna , turning to Land@@ au , ' as you don '@@ t understand English ; but it is quite short . '
'@@ Oh , I shall understand , ' replied Land@@ au with the same smile , and closed his eyes .
K@@ aren@@ in and Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna exchanged significant looks , and the reading began .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky F@@ EL@@ T completely puzzled by the strange and novel language he was listening to .
listening to the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna and feeling the fine eyes , naive or ro@@ gu@@ ish - he did not know which - of Land@@ au fixed upon him , O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky began to be conscious of a peculiar sort of heav@@ iness in his head .
the most varied ideas were mixed up in his mind .
'@@ Mary San@@ ina is glad that her child is dead ...
to be saved one need only have faith ; the monks don '@@ t know how to do it , but the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna knows ...
and what is so heavy in my head ?
is it the brandy , or is it because all this is so very strange ?
all the same , I think I have not done anything to shock them up till now .
but still , it won '@@ t do to ask her help now .
I have heard that they make one pray .
that would be too stupid !
why is he B@@ ez@@ zu@@ bov ? '
suddenly O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky felt his ne@@ ther jaw dropping irresisti@@ bly for a y@@ awn .
he smoo@@ thed his whis@@ kers to hide the y@@ awn , and gave himself a shake .
but then he felt himself falling asleep , and nearly sno@@ red .
he r@@ oused himself , just when the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna uttered the words : ' he is asleep . '
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky aw@@ oke in a f@@ right , feeling guilty and detected .
but he was immediately comfor@@ ted by noticing that the words ' He is asleep ' did not apply to him but to Land@@ au .
but whereas O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's sleep would , he imagined , have offended them - he did not really even think this , for everything seemed so strange - Land@@ au 's sleep delighted them extremely , especially Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna .
the French@@ man slept or pre@@ tended to sleep , leaning his head against the back of the chair , and his mo@@ ist hand lying on his knee moved fee@@ bly , as if catching something .
K@@ aren@@ in rose , and though he tried to be cautious he caught against the table . he went up to the French@@ man and placed his hand in his .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky also rose and , opening his eyes wide to wake himself up in case he was asleep , looked first at one and then at the other .
it was all quite real , and O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky felt his head getting worse and worse .
'@@ Q@@ u '@@ elle sor@@ te ! ' repeated the French@@ man impati@@ ently .
when he returned to Peter O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's house , where he was staying , he found a note from Bet@@ sy .
she wrote that she greatly wished to finish the conversation they had begun , and asked him to call next day .
scarcely had he finished reading the note and made a w@@ ry face over it , when he heard down@@ stairs the heavy steps of men carrying something heavy .
it was Peter O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , grown young again .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky was in low spirits , a thing that rarely happened to him , and could not fall asleep for a long time .
everything he recalled was nause@@ ous , but most re@@ pul@@ sive of all , like something shameful , was the memory of the evening at Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna 's .
next day he received from K@@ aren@@ in a definite refusal to divorce Anna , and understood that this decision was based on what the French@@ man had said the evening before , in his real or pre@@ tended sleep .
before AN@@ Y definite ST@@ EP CA@@ N BE taken in a household , there must be either complete division or loving accord between husband and wife .
when their relations are indefinite it is impossible for them to make any move .
many families continue for years in their old ru@@ ts , hated by both husband and wife , merely because there is neither complete discord nor harmony .
the irritation which divided them had no tangible cause , and all attempts at an explanation not only failed to clear it away but increased it .
neither of them spoke of the cause of their irritation , but each thought the other in the wrong , and at every opportunity tried to prove that this was so .
she was jeal@@ ous , not of any one woman , but of the dimin@@ ution of his love .
at the slightest hint she transferred her jealousy from one object to another .
and being jeal@@ ous , Anna was indig@@ n@@ ant with him and constantly sought reasons to justify her indignation .
she blamed him for everything that was hard in her situation .
the torture of expectation , living bet@@ wi@@ x@@ t heaven and earth , which she endured there in Moscow , K@@ aren@@ in 's dil@@ ator@@ iness and ind@@ eci@@ sion , her loneliness - she attributed all to him .
if he loved her he would fully understand the difficulty of her situation , and would deliver her from it .
that they were living in Moscow , instead of in the country , was also his fault .
he could not live buried in the country as she desired .
he needed society , and so he had placed her in this terrible position , the misery of which he would not understand .
and it was likewise his fault that she was for ever parted from her son .
even the rare moments of ten@@ derness which occurred between them did not paci@@ fy her ; in his ten@@ derness she now saw a ting@@ e of calm assurance which had not been there before and irrit@@ ated her .
it was growing d@@ us@@ k .
passing ever backwards from the memor@@ ably offensive words of the quarrel to their cause , she at last got back to the beginning of their conversation .
for a long time she could not believe that the dispute had begun from a perfectly in@@ offensive conversation about a matter that did not touch the heart of either .
yet it was so .
it had all begun by his laughing at High Scho@@ ols for girls , which he considered unnecessary and she defended .
he spoke dis@@ respec@@ tfully of the education of women in general , and said that Hann@@ ah , her little English prote@@ g@@ é@@ e , did not at all need to know physics .
she saw in it a cont@@ emp@@ tuous all@@ usion to her own knowledge ; and she invented and uttered a phrase in retaliation which should revenge the pain he had caused her .
'@@ i don '@@ t expect you to understand me and my feelings , as an aff@@ ection@@ ate man would ; but I did expect ordinary del@@ icacy , ' she said .
and he really had fl@@ ushed with v@@ ex@@ ation and had said something dis@@ agre@@ eable .
she did not remember her reply to it , but remembered that in answer he had said with obvious intent to hurt her too :
'@@ i can take no interest in your partiality for that little girl , because I can see that it is un@@ natural . '
'@@ i am very sorry that only what is coarse and material is comprehensible and natural to you , ' she ret@@ or@@ ted and left the room .
when he came to her in the evening they did not refer to the quarrel , but both felt that it was only smoo@@ thed over , not settled .
'@@ i am to blame ; I am irrit@@ able and un@@ reasonably jeal@@ ous .
I will make it up with him and we will go back to the country . there I shall be cal@@ mer . '
'@@ Un@@ natural ! ' she suddenly remembered the word that had hurt her most , though it was not so much the word as his intention to pain her .
'@@ i know what he wanted to say : he wanted to say that it is un@@ natural not to love one 's own daughter and yet to love another 's child .
what does he know of love for children , - of my love for Ser@@ ez@@ ha whom I have given up for his sake ?
and that desire to hurt me !
no , he must be in love with some other woman ; it can '@@ t be anything else . '
then , realizing that in her attempt to quiet herself she had again completed the circle she had already gone round so often , and had returned to her former cause of irritation , she was horror @@@ -@@ @ struck at herself .
is it possible that I can '@@ t take it on myself ? ' she wondered , and began again from the beginning . ' he is truthful , he is honest .
he loves me . I love him .
yes , now , as soon as he comes back , I will tell him I was to blame , though in fact I was not , and we will go away ! '
and not to continue thinking , and not to yield to irritation , she rang and ordered her tr@@ unks to be brought , to pack their things for the country .
'@@ W@@ EL@@ L , HAV@@ E YOU H@@ AD A GO@@ OD T@@ IME ? ' she asked , coming out to meet him with a me@@ ek and repent@@ ant look on her face .
'@@ Just as usual , ' he answered , percei@@ ving at a glance that she was in one of her pleasant moods .
he was already accustomed to these transitions , and to @@@ -@@ @ day was specially glad , because he himself was in the best of spirits .
Ah , that 's right ! ' he said , pointing to the tr@@ unks in the ante @@@ -@@ @ room .
'@@ Yes we must go away .
'@@ It is my only wish .
order tea . '
and he went to his room .
when he returned she told him , partly repeating words she had prepared , how she had spent the day and her plans for the move to the country .
'@@ Do you know , it came to me almost like an inspiration ? ' said she . ' why must we wait here for the divorce ?
I can '@@ t wait any longer .
I don '@@ t want to hope , I don '@@ t want to hear anything about the divorce .
I have made up my mind that it shall not influence my life any more .
'@@ Oh yes ! ' he answered , looking un@@ easily at her excited face .
'@@ Well , and what have you been doing ? who was there ? ' she asked after a pause .
V@@ ron@@ sky named the guests . ' the dinner was capital , the boat @@@ -@@ @ races and everything quite nice , but in Moscow they can '@@ t get on without doing something ridiculous ...
some sort of a lady turned up - the Queen of Sweden 's swimming instruc@@ tress - and displayed her art . '
'@@ What ? she sw@@ am ? ' asked Anna , with a fro@@ wn .
'@@ Yes , in some sort of red costume de nat@@ ation [ Swimming costume . ] - a hide@@ ous old creature !
and did she swim in some particular way ? ' asked Anna , without answering his question .
'@@ No@@ thing particular at all .
I said it was aw@@ fully absurd ...
well , when do you think of going ? '
Anna shook her head , as though driving away an unpleasant thought .
'@@ When are we going ?
why , the sooner the better .
wait a bit ! the day after to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row is Sunday , and I must go and see mam@@ an , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , and became confused , because as soon as he had mentioned his mother he felt an intent and suspicious gaze fixed upon him .
his embarrassment confirmed her suspicions .
she fl@@ ushed and moved away from him .
it was no longer the Queen of Sweden 's instruc@@ tress but the Princess Sor@@ ok@@ ina who lived in the country near Moscow with the Countess V@@ ron@@ skaya who presented herself to Anna 's imagination .
'@@ You could go there to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row ! ' she said .
'@@ If that 's so , then we won '@@ t go at all ! '
'@@ Why 's that ? ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , as if in surprise . ' there 's no sense in that . '
'@@ You see no sense in it because you don '@@ t care at all about me .
the one person I was interested in here was Hann@@ ah - you say that is all pret@@ ence !
you said yesterday that I don '@@ t love my daughter but pretend to love that English girl , and that it is un@@ natural ! I should like to know what sort of life can be natural for me here ! '
for a moment she recoll@@ ected herself and was horri@@ fied at having broken her resolution .
yet though she knew she was ru@@ ining her cause , she could not restrain herself , could not for@@ bear pointing out to him how wrong he was , and could not submit to him .
'@@ i never said that ; I only said that I do not sympath@@ ize with that sudden affection . '
'@@ Why do you , who boast of your tru@@ th@@ fulness , not speak the truth ? '
'@@ i never boast and never tell un@@ truths , ' he said softly , restr@@ aining his rising anger . ' it is a great pity if you don '@@ t respect ... '
'@@ Resp@@ ect was invented to fill the empty place where love ought to be !
but if you no longer love me , it would be better and more hon@@ our@@ able to say so ! '
'@@ What do you mean by that ? ' she cried , gl@@ ancing with terror at the definite expression of hatred on his whole face , and especially in the cruel , men@@ acing eyes .
'@@ i mean to say ... ' he began , but stopped . ' I must ask what you want of me ! '
'@@ What can I want ?
I can only want you not to abandon me , as you are thinking of doing , ' she said , having understood all that he had left un@@ said . ' but I don '@@ t want that , that is secondary .
what I want is love , and it is lacking .
therefore all is finished ! '
'@@ Stop !
St @@@ -@@ @ o @@@ -@@ @ op ! ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , his bro@@ w still knit , but holding her back by the hand . ' what is the matter ?
I said we must put off our departure for three days , and you replied that I lie and am not an hon@@ our@@ able man . '
'@@ Yes ! and I repeat that a man who repro@@ aches me because he has given up everything for my sake , ' said she , recalling the words of a still earlier quarrel , ' is worse than a dis@@ hon@@ our@@ able man ! he is a hear@@ tless man ! '
'@@ no ! there are limits to one 's endurance , ' he exclaimed , and quickly let go her hand .
'@@ He h@@ ates me , that is clear , ' thought she , and silently , without looking round and with f@@ altering steps , she left the room .
'@@ He loves another woman , that is clearer still , ' she said to herself as she entered her own room . ' I want love , and it is lacking .
so everything is finished ! ' she repeated her own words , ' and it must be finished . '
in her soul there was another vague idea , which alone interested her , but of which she could not get hold .
again remembering K@@ aren@@ in , she also remembered her illness after her confin@@ ement , and the feeling that never left her at that time .
she remem@@ ber@@ ed@@ . her words , ' Why did I not die ? ' and her feelings then .
and suddenly she understood what was in her soul .
yes , that was the thought which would solve everything .
Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich 's shame and dis@@ grace , and Ser@@ ez@@ ha 's , and my own terrible shame - all will be saved by my death .
if I die he too will repent , will pity me , will love me and will suffer on my account ! '
with a fixed smile of self @@@ -@@ @ pity on her lips she sat in the chair , taking off and putting on the rings on her left hand , and vivi@@ dly pic@@ turing to herself from various points of view his feelings after she was dead .
sounds of approaching steps , his steps , distracted her thoughts .
pretending to be putting away her rings , she did not even turn round .
he came up to her , and taking her hand said softly :
'@@ What is it ? ' he asked .
'@@ You know yourself ? ' said she , and at the same moment , unable to restrain herself any longer , she burst into tears .
'@@ Ab@@ and@@ on me ! abandon me ! ' she mur@@ mu@@ red between her so@@ bs .
I don '@@ t wish to tor@@ ment you , I don '@@ t !
I will set you free .
V@@ ron@@ sky implo@@ red her to be calm , and assured her that there was not an atom of foundation for her jealousy , that he never had ceased , and never would cease , to love her , that he loved her more than ever .
'@@ Anna , why torture yourself and me like this ? ' he said , kis@@ sing her hands .
his face now wore a tender expression , and she thought she detected in his voice the sound of tears , and their moisture on her hand .
and instantly her des@@ pairing jealousy changed into desperate , passionate ten@@ derness . she embraced him , and covered his head , his neck , and his hands with kis@@ ses .
feeling THAT TH@@ E@@ Y W@@ ERE ENT@@ I@@ RE@@ LY reconciled , next morning Anna began actively to make preparations for their move .
she stood in her room before an open trunk , sorting clothes , when he came in earlier than usual and ready dressed .
'@@ i will go to mam@@ an at once . she can send me the money through E@@ gor@@ ov and I shall be ready to go to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row , ' said he .
good as the mood she was in might be , the reference to the move to the country pr@@ icked her .
V@@ ron@@ sky was eating his be@@ ef@@ ste@@ ak when she entered the dining @@@ -@@ @ room .
'@@ You would hardly believe how disgu@@ sting these rooms have become to me ! ' she said , sitting down to her coffee beside him . ' there is nothing worse than these furnished apartments !
they are expres@@ sion@@ less and sou@@ l@@ less .
I think of Vo@@ z@@ d@@ vi@@ zhen@@ sk as of a Promis@@ ed Land .
are you driving out anywhere ? '
'@@ i wanted to go to the Wil@@ sons , to take her a dress .
V@@ ron@@ sky 's val@@ et came in to fetch a receipt for a tel@@ eg@@ ram from Petersburg .
there was nothing odd in his receiving a tel@@ eg@@ ram , but , as if wishing to hide something from her , he told the man that the receipt was in his study and hastily turned to her , saying :
'@@ From whom was the tel@@ eg@@ ram ? ' she asked , not listening to him .
'@@ From Steve , ' he replied reluctantly .
'@@ Why did@@ n '@@ t you show it me ?
what secret can Steve have from me ? '
'@@ i did not wish to show it you , because Steve has a passion for tele@@ graph@@ ing . what is the use of tele@@ graph@@ ing when nothing has been settled ? '
'@@ Yes , but he wires : " could get no answer .
promises a decisive answer soon . "
Anna took the tel@@ eg@@ ram with trembling hands and saw exactly what V@@ ron@@ sky had said , but at the end were added the words : ' little hope , but I 'll do everything possible and impossible . '
'@@ i said yesterday that it is all the same to me when I get the divorce , or even whether I get it at all , ' she said , fl@@ ushing . ' there was no need at all to conceal it from me . '
and she thought : ' in the same way he may hide and is hiding from me his correspondence with women . '
'@@ Oh , Y@@ ash@@ vin wanted to come this morning with Vo@@ y@@ tov , ' said V@@ ron@@ sky . ' it seems he has won from P@@ ev@@ tsov all and even more than P@@ ev@@ tsov can pay - about sixty thousand roubles . '
I said that I don '@@ t want to think about it , and I wish that you were as little interested in it as I am . '
'@@ It interests me because I like defin@@ it@@ eness , ' he replied .
'@@ Defin@@ it@@ eness depends not on forms , but on love , ' she said , growing more and more irrit@@ ated not at his words but at the tone of cool tranqu@@ ill@@ ity with which he spoke . ' why do you want it ? '
'@@ Oh God ! again about love ! ' he thought with a w@@ ry face .
'@@ Don '@@ t you know why ? for your own sake and for that of the children we may have ! ' said he .
'@@ That 's a great pity , ' he said .
'@@ You want it for the children , but you don '@@ t think of me , ' she pursued , quite forgetting or not hearing that he said : ' for your own sake and for the children . '
the possibility of having children had long been a subject of dispute , and it irrit@@ ated her .
she explained his desire to have children as showing that he did not value her beauty .
'@@ Oh , I said for your sake !
most of all for your sake , ' he repeated , his face cont@@ or@@ ted as with pain , ' because I am convinced that a great deal of your irrit@@ ability is due to our indefinite position . '
'@@ That is not the reason , ' she said , ' and I can '@@ t even understand how what you call my " irrit@@ ability " can be caused by that ; I am entirely in your power .
what inde@@ fin@@ it@@ eness of position is there ?
'@@ i am very sorry you don '@@ t wish to understand me , ' he interrupted , stubbor@@ nly intent on expressing his thought . ' the inde@@ fin@@ it@@ eness consists in your imag@@ ining that I am free . '
'@@ You may be perfectly at rest on that matter ! ' she re@@ joined , and turning away she began to drink her coffee .
after a few si@@ ps she glanced at him , and from the expression of his face clearly realized that her hand , her movement , and the sound made by her lips were re@@ pul@@ sive to him .
'@@ It is perfectly indifferent to me what your mother thinks and whom she wishes to marry you to , ' she went on , putting down her cup with a trembling hand .
'@@ But we are not talking about that . '
'@@ Yes , about that very thing !
and believe me , a hear@@ tless woman , be she old or young , your mother or a stranger , does not interest me , and I don '@@ t want to have anything to do with her . '
'@@ Anna , I beg you not to speak dis@@ respec@@ tfully of my mother . '
'a woman whose heart has not div@@ ined where@@ in her son 's happiness and honour lies has no heart ! '
'@@ i repeat my request that you should not speak dis@@ respec@@ tfully of my mother , whom I respect ! ' said he , raising his voice and looking ster@@ nly at her .
looking int@@ ently at his face and hands , she remembered their reconciliation the day before and his passionate ca@@ resses in all their details .
'@@ Just such ca@@ resses he has lav@@ ished , and wants to lav@@ ish , on other women , ' she thought .
'@@ You don '@@ t love your mother !
it 's all words , words , words ! ' she said , looking at him with hatred .
'@@ Deci@@ de ... and I have decided , ' she said and was about to go away , but just then Y@@ ash@@ vin entered . Anna said ' Good morning , ' and stopped .
'@@ Oh , I don '@@ t know . I don '@@ t think I shall get it all , and on Wednesday I must go .
and you ? ' asked Y@@ ash@@ vin , looking at V@@ ron@@ sky with half @@@ -@@ @ closed eyes and evidently div@@ ining that there had been a quarrel .
'@@ Yes , but now it 's decided , ' said Anna , looking straight into V@@ ron@@ sky 's eyes with an expression that told him he must not think of the possibility of a reconciliation .
'@@ is it possible you are not sorry for that unfortunate P@@ ev@@ tsov ? ' she said , continuing her conversation with Y@@ ash@@ vin .
you see , my whole fortune is here , ' and he pointed to a side pocket , ' and now I am a rich man ; but I shall go to the club to @@@ -@@ @ night and shall perhaps leave it a beg@@ gar .
so we struggle , and therein lies the pleasure ! '
'@@ But sup@@ posing you were married ? how would your wife feel about it ? ' asked Anna .
'@@ i expect that 's why I never married , and never meant to . '
'@@ How about Hel@@ sing@@ for@@ s ? ' said V@@ ron@@ sky , joining in the conversation , and he glanced at Anna who had smiled .
meeting his look , her face suddenly assumed a col@@ dly severe expression , as if to say : ' it is not forgotten .
'@@ is it possible you were ever in love ? ' she asked Y@@ ash@@ vin .
'@@ Oh heavens ! how many times !
but , you see , some men find it possible to sit down to cards and yet to be able always to leave when the time comes for an as@@ sig@@ nation !
now I can engage in love @@@ -@@ @ making , but always so as not to be late for cards in the evening .
'@@ no , I am not asking about that , but about the real thing . ' she was going to say Hel@@ sing@@ for@@ s , but did not want to repeat the word V@@ ron@@ sky had used .
before leaving the house V@@ ron@@ sky came to her room .
she wished to pretend to be looking for something on the table , but feeling ashamed of the pret@@ ence , looked straight into his face with a cold expression .
'@@ Gam@@ bet@@ ta 's certificate ; I have sold him , ' he replied in a tone which said more clearly than words : ' I have no time for explanations , and they would lead to nothing . '
'@@ i am not at all in the wrong toward her , ' he thought . ' if she wants to punish herself , tant PiS pour El@@ le ! '
[ so much the worse for her . ] But , as he was going out , he thought she said something , and suddenly his heart ached with pity for her .
'@@ If it 's nothing , then tant PiS ! ' he thought , again ch@@ illed . turning away , he went out .
as he was going out he caught sight in a looking @@@ -@@ @ glass of her pale face and trembling lips .
he even wished to stop and say a comfor@@ ting word to her , but his legs carried him out of the room before he had thought of anything to say .
all that day he spent away from home , and when he returned late at night the maid told him that Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna had a headache and asked him not to go to her room .
this was the first time it had been so , and this was not even a quarrel .
it was an evident acknowled@@ gment of complete e@@ strang@@ ement .
how could he look at her as he had looked when he came into the room for the certificate ?
look at her , see that her heart was torn by despair , and go out in silence with that calmly indifferent look ?
not only had he cooled toward her , but he hated her because he loved another woman - that was clear .
and recalling all the cruel words he had uttered , Anna invented other words which he evidently had wished to say and could have said to her , and she grew more and more ex@@ as@@ per@@ ated .
'@@ i do not hold you , ' he might have said . ' you may go where you please .
you probably did not wish to be divorced from your husband so that you could go back to him .
if you need money , I will give you some .
how many roubles do you want ? '
all the cru@@ ell@@ est words that a coarse man could say he , in her imagination , said to her , and she did not forgive him for them any more than if he had really said them .
'@@ And was it not last night that he , an hon@@ our@@ able and truthful man , s@@ wore he loved me ?
have I not often before desp@@ aired need@@ lessly ? ' she said to herself immediately after .
if not , it means that all is over , and then I will decide what I am to do ... !
at night she heard his carriage stop , heard him ring , heard his steps , and his voice talking to the maid . he believed what he was told , did not want to learn more and went to his room !
so all was over !
now it was all the same whether they went to Vo@@ z@@ d@@ vi@@ zhen@@ sk or not , whether she got a divorce or not - it was all useless .
all she wanted was to punish him .
'@@ How could I say those cruel words to her ? ' he would say . ' how could I leave the room without saying anything ?
but now she is no more !
'@@ Death ! ' she thought .
and such terror came upon her that it was long before she could realize where she was and with trembling hand could find the matches to light another candle in the place of the one that had burnt down and gone out .
'@@ no - anything , only to live !
why , I love him !
and he loves me ; All this has been , but will pass , ' she said , feeling that tears of joy at this return to life were running down her cheeks .
and , to escape from her fears , she hastily went to him in his study .
she came up , and holding the light above him looked at him long .
without waking him she returned to her room , and after a second dose of opium toward morning she fell into a heavy but troubled sleep , without ever c@@ easing to be conscious of herself .
in the morning a terrible nightmare , which had come to her several times even before her union with V@@ ron@@ sky , repeated itself and woke her .
and she aw@@ oke in a cold per@@ spir@@ ation .
when she got up , the previous day appeared in her memory as in a fog .
there had been a quarrel .
it was what had happened several times before .
'@@ i said I had a headache , and he did not come to see me .
to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row we shall leave . I must see him and get ready for the move , ' she thought .
after some talking in the hall , some one came up@@ stairs and she heard V@@ ron@@ sky 's step outside the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room .
he was going quickly down@@ stairs .
there he was on the steps , without a hat , going down to the carriage .
the young girl in the l@@ il@@ ac hat handed him a parcel .
V@@ ron@@ sky said something to her and smiled .
yesterday 's feelings w@@ run@@ g her aching heart with fresh pain .
she could not now understand how she could have humiliated herself so as to remain a whole day with him in his house .
she went to his study to announce to him her decision .
'@@ It was the Princess Sor@@ ok@@ ina with her daughter who came to bring me the money and documents from mam@@ an .
I could not get them yesterday .
how is your head - better ? ' he said quietly , not wishing to see or understand the gloomy and solemn look on her face .
she stood silent in the middle of the room , looking at him int@@ ently .
he glanced at her , fro@@ w@@ ned for an instant , and continued to read a letter .
she turned , and slowly moved from the room .
he could still call her back , but she reached the door and he remained silent , and only the ru@@ st@@ le of the paper as he turned a page was heard .
'@@ Oh , by the way - ' he said when she was already in the doorway - ' we are definitely going to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row , are@@ n '@@ t we ? '
'@@ You , but not I , ' she said , turning round toward him .
'@@ This is becoming intolerable ! '
'@@ You ... you will repent of this ! ' she said , and left him .
al@@ armed by the des@@ pairing look with which she had said these words , he jumped up , inten@@ ding to run after her , but , recoll@@ ecting himself , he sat down again , tightly cl@@ en@@ ching his teeth and fro@@ w@@ ning .
'@@ i have tried everything , ' he thought , ' the only thing left is to pay no attention , ' and he began getting ready to drive to town , and to go again to his mother 's to obtain her signature to a power of attorney .
she heard the sound of his steps in the study and dining @@@ -@@ @ room .
but he did not return to her ; he only gave an order that they should let Vo@@ y@@ tov have the horse in his absence .
then she heard the carriage drive up and the door open , and he went out again .
but now he re @@@ -@@ @ entered the hall , and some one ran up@@ stairs .
she went back to the window and saw him take the gloves without looking , and , having touched the co@@ ach@@ man 's back with his hand , say something to him .
then , without turning to look up at the window , he sat down in the carriage in his usual posture , crossing one leg over the other , and , putting on a g@@ love , disappeared round the com@@ er .
is IT finished ? ' said Anna to herself as she stood by the window ; and in answer to that question , the impressions left by the darkness when her candle went out and by the terrible dream , merging into one , filled her heart with icy horror .
'@@ no , it is impossible ! ' she exclaimed and , crossing the room , she rang loudly .
she was so terrified at being alone that she did not wait for the servant but went out to meet him .
the man replied that the Count had gone to the st@@ ables .
'@@ Very well .
send Michael with it to the st@@ ables at once .
come home . we must talk it over .
for God 's sake come ; I am frightened . '
then , afraid to remain alone now , she followed him out of the room and went to the nur@@ sery .
'@@ How is this ? that 's not it - this is not he !
the little girl , sitting at the table , persistently and firmly ham@@ mer@@ ed on it with the stop@@ per of a bottle , gaz@@ ing bl@@ ank@@ ly at her mother with her two black @@@ -@@ @ cur@@ ran@@ ts of eyes .
but the child 's loud ringing laughter and a movement of her eyebrows reminded Anna so vivi@@ dly of V@@ ron@@ sky , that , re@@ pressing her so@@ bs , she rose hur@@ ri@@ edly and left the room .
no , it C@@ AN@@ NOT be , ' she thought . ' he will come back .
but how will he explain to me that smile , and his animation after he had spoken to her ?
if I don '@@ t believe him , there is only one way left for me ... and I don '@@ t want that . '
twelve minutes had passed .
'@@ Now he has received my note and is on his way back .
no , that 's impossible !
he must not find me with red eyes .
Oh ! and did I brush my hair or not ? ' she asked herself ; but could not remember .
'@@ Yes , my hair was done , but I don '@@ t in the least remember when . '
she did not even trust her hand , and went up to the mirror to see whether her hair really was done or not .
it was , but she could not remember doing it .
'@@ Yes that is I ! ' she suddenly realized , and looking at her whole figure she suddenly felt his kis@@ ses , sh@@ ud@@ dered , and moved her shoulders .
'@@ What is it ? am I going mad ? ' and she went to her bedroom , where Ann@@ ush@@ ka was ti@@ dying up .
'@@ Ann@@ ush@@ ka ! ' she said , stopping before the maid and looking at her , without knowing what she would say to her .
'@@ You wished to go to see the Princess O@@ bl@@ on@@ skaya , ' said the maid , apparently understanding her .
'@@ But how could he go away leaving me in this condition ?
just as she was going to compare her watch with the large clock some one drove up .
but no one came up@@ stairs and she heard voices below .
her messenger had returned in the carriage .
'@@ Oh , of course ! he did not receive it , ' she remembered .
'@@ Go with this note to the Countess V@@ ron@@ skaya 's country house ; do you know it ?
'@@ But what shall I do myself ? ' she thought . ' yes I will go to Dol@@ ly 's , of course , or else I shall go out of my mind !
and I can tele@@ graph as well ! '
'@@ i must speak to you , come at once . '
ready dressed and with her bon@@ net on , she again looked at Ann@@ ush@@ ka 's plac@@ id and now still r@@ oun@@ der face .
evident compassion showed plainly in those kindly little grey eyes .
'@@ Ann@@ ush@@ ka , my dear ! what am I to do ? ' mut@@ tered Anna so@@ b@@ bing , as she sank hel@@ pl@@ essly into an arm @@@ -@@ @ chair .
'@@ Why take it so to heart , Anna Ark@@ ady@@ evna ?
such things will happen .
'@@ Yes , I will go , ' said Anna , recovering and r@@ ousing herself ; ' and if a tel@@ eg@@ ram comes during my absence , send it to Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na 's ...
'@@ Where to , ma '@@ am ? ' asked Peter , before getting onto the box .
the weather W@@ AS BR@@ IG@@ HT .
all the morning there had been fine dri@@ zz@@ ling rain , but it had now just cleared up .
it was three o 'clock ; the busi@@ est time in the streets .
now the idea of death no longer seemed so terrible and clear , and death itself no longer seemed inevitable .
she repro@@ ached herself now with the humiliation to which she had descended .
'@@ i entre@@ ated him to forgive me .
I have surrendered to him .
can I not live without him ? '
dental surgeon ... "
she is not fond of V@@ ron@@ sky .
it will be humiliating and painful , but I will tell her everything .
she is fond of me and I will follow her advice .
I won '@@ t submit to him ; I won '@@ t let him educate me ...
the Moscow water is so good .
and she remembered how , long , long ago , when she was only seventeen , she visited the Tro@@ itsa Monastery with her aunt .
how many things that then seemed to me excellent and un@@ attainable have since become insignificant , and things that then existed are now for ever un@@ attainable !
should I then have believed that I should descend to such humiliation ?
how proud and satisfied he will be to get my note !
how nasty that paint smells !
why are they always painting and building ?
" Dres@@ sm@@ aking and Mill@@ inery , " - ' she read .
a man bowed to her .
it was Ann@@ ush@@ ka 's husband .
'@@ Our paras@@ ite , ' she remembered how V@@ ron@@ sky had said the words . ' our ?
we C@@ AN@@ NOT tear it out but we can hide the memory of it .
and I will hide it ! '
at this point she recoll@@ ected her past with K@@ aren@@ in and how she had eff@@ ac@@ ed the memory of him .
'@@ Dol@@ ly will think I am leaving a second husband and that I am therefore certainly un@@ justifiable .
do I want to be justified ?
I can '@@ t ! ' she said to herself , and wished to cry .
but she immediately began to wonder what those two young girls could be smiling at .
the bou@@ levard and children .
three boys running about playing at horses .
and I shall lose everything and Sh@@ an '@@ t get him back .
yes , I shall lose everything if he does not return .
'@@ is anyone here ? ' she asked in the ante @@@ -@@ @ room .
that same Kit@@ ty with whom V@@ ron@@ sky was in love , ' thought Anna . ' she whom he remembered aff@@ ection@@ ately .
and of me he thinks with hate and regre@@ ts having joined himself to me ! '
when Anna arrived the two sisters were consulting about feeding the baby .
Dol@@ ly went out alone to meet the visitor who at that moment had come to interrupt their talk .
'@@ So you have not left yet ?
I was myself coming to see you , ' said Dol@@ ly . ' I had a letter from Steve to @@@ -@@ @ day . '
'@@ We also had a tel@@ eg@@ ram from him , ' replied Anna , looking round for Kit@@ ty .
'@@ He writes that he C@@ AN@@ NOT understand what Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich really wants , but that he won '@@ t leave without getting an answer . '
'@@ Yes , Kit@@ ty , ' answered Dol@@ ly with embarrassment . ' she is in the nur@@ sery .
'@@ i heard about it .
'@@ i will fetch it at once .
but he has not refused ; on the contrary , Steve is hopeful , ' added Dol@@ ly , pa@@ using at the door .
'@@ i have no hope , and don '@@ t even desire it , ' said Anna .
'@@ What does it mean ? Kit@@ ty considers it humiliating to meet me ! ' thought Anna when she was left alone .
I know that no respectable woman can receive me in my position .
I knew that from the first moment I sacrificed everything for him .
it is still worse for me ; it is harder than ever ! ' she heard the voices of the sisters confer@@ ring together in the next room .
it is no use appealing to her .
but it would be interesting to see Kit@@ ty and show her how I desp@@ ise everybody and everything : how indifferent everything is to me . '
'@@ i knew it all , ' she said , ' and it does not interest me in the least . '
I , on the contrary , am hopeful , ' said Dol@@ ly , looking at Anna with curiosity .
she had never seen her in such a strange and irrit@@ able mood . ' when are you leaving ? ' she asked .
Anna , scre@@ wing up her eyes , gaz@@ ed straight before her without answering .
'@@ is Kit@@ ty hiding from me then ? ' she asked , looking toward the door and bl@@ ushing .
'@@ Oh , what nonsense !
she is nursing her baby and has difficulty with it , and I was advising her ...
she is very pleased .
she will come directly , ' Dol@@ ly said awk@@ war@@ dly , not knowing how to tell an un@@ truth . ' Oh , here she is ! '
when she heard that Anna had come Kit@@ ty did not wish to appear ; but Dol@@ ly persuaded her .
having mu@@ stered up her courage , Kit@@ ty came in and , bl@@ ushing , went up to Anna and held out her hand .
'@@ i am very pleased - ' she began in a trembling voice .
'@@ i should not have been surprised if you had not wanted to see me .
I have got used to everything .
you have been ill ?
yes , you are changed ! ' said Anna .
she attributed that anim@@ osity to the awkward position Anna , who had formerly patron@@ ized her , now felt herself to be in , and she was sorry for her .
they talked about Kit@@ ty 's illness , about the baby , and about Steve ; but evidently nothing interested Anna .
'@@ i came to say good @@@ -@@ @ bye to you , ' she said , rising .
but Anna again , without repl@@ ying , turned to Kit@@ ty .
'@@ Yes , I am very glad to have seen you , ' she said with a smile . ' I have heard so much about you from everybody , and even from your husband .
he called on me and I liked him very much , ' she added , with obvious ill intent . ' where is he ? '
'@@ He has gone to the country , ' answered Kit@@ ty , bl@@ ushing .
'@@ Rem@@ ember me to him ; be sure you do ! '
'@@ i will be sure to , ' repeated Kit@@ ty nai@@ vely , looking comp@@ assi@@ on@@ ately into her eyes .
'@@ Well then , good @@@ -@@ @ bye , Dol@@ ly ! ' and kis@@ sing Dol@@ ly and pressing Kit@@ ty 's hand , Anna hur@@ ried away .
'@@ She is still the same and as attractive as ever .
charming ! ' said Kit@@ ty when she was once more alone with her sister . ' but there is something pathetic about her , terribly pathetic ! '
'@@ Yes , but to @@@ -@@ @ day there is something peculiar about her , ' said Dol@@ ly . ' when I was seeing her out , there in the ante @@@ -@@ @ room , I thought she was going to cry . '
Anna RE@@ SE@@ AT@@ ED herself IN THE CA@@ L@@ È@@ CH@@ E in a state of mind even worse than when she left home .
to her former tor@@ ments was now added a feeling of being aff@@ ron@@ ted and repudi@@ ated , of which she had been clearly sensible during the meeting with Kit@@ ty .
home ? ' asked Peter .
'@@ Yes , home , ' she said , now not even thinking of where she was going .
'@@ How they looked at me , as at something dreadful , incomprehensible , and strange ! ...
what can he be telling that other man so warmly ? ' she thought , gl@@ ancing at two pedestrians . ' how is it possible to tell another what one feels ?
I meant to tell Dol@@ ly , but it 's a good thing I did@@ n '@@ t .
she would have concealed it ; but her chief feeling would have been joy that I am punished for the pleasures she has envi@@ ed me .
Kit@@ ty would have been still more pleased .
she knows I was more than usually am@@ i@@ able to her husband .
in her eyes I am an immoral woman .
if I were immoral I could make her husband fall in love with me ... if I wanted to .
but he knows me as little as does anyone else in the world .
I know my appe@@ ti@@ tes , " as the French say .
( an absurd name . ) ]
I shall tell him that when he comes back , ' she thought and smiled .
but just then she recoll@@ ected that now she had no one to tell anything funny to . ' besides , there is nothing am@@ using or mer@@ ry .
they are ringing for V@@ esp@@ ers , and how carefully that trad@@ es@@ man is crossing himself , as if he were afraid of dropping something !
what are those churches , that ringing , and these lies for ?
only to conceal the fact that we all hate each other , like those cab@@ men who are so an@@ gr@@ ily sw@@ earing at one another .
Y@@ ash@@ vin says : " he wants to leave me without a shirt , and I him . "
with these thoughts , which occupied her so that she even forgot to think of her troubles , she arrived at the por@@ ch of their house .
'@@ is there an answer ? ' she asked .
'@@ i will look , ' he replied , and gl@@ ancing at his desk he took up and handed her the thin square envelope of a tel@@ eg@@ ram .
'@@ i C@@ AN@@ NOT return before ten - V@@ ron@@ sky , ' she read .
'@@ And the man has not yet returned ? '
'@@ no , ma '@@ am , ' answered the hall @@@ -@@ @ porter .
before qu@@ itting him for ever , I will tell him everything .
seeing his hat on the hat @@@ -@@ @ rail , she sh@@ ud@@ dered with aver@@ sion .
she imagined him now calmly convers@@ ing with his mother and the Princess Sor@@ ok@@ ina , and rejo@@ icing at her sufferings .
'@@ Yes , I must go at once , ' she thought , not yet sure where to go to .
she wished to get away as soon as possible from the feelings she experienced in that terrible house .
the servants , the walls , the things in the house , all rep@@ elled and ang@@ ered her , and oppressed her like a weight .
'@@ Yes , I must go to the railway station , and if I don '@@ t find him , I must go there and expose him . '
the train left at 8.2 p.m.
'@@ i shall have time . '
she gave the order to harness another pair of horses , and busi@@ ed herself packing her hand@@ bag with things necessary for a few days .
dinner was served . she went to the table , sm@@ elt the bread and cheese and as the smell of everything E@@ atable revol@@ ted her , she sent for the carriage and went out .
the house already threw a shadow right across the street ; the evening was bright , and the sun still warm .
Ann@@ ush@@ ka , who came out with Anna 's things , and Peter , who put them into the carriage , and the co@@ ach@@ man , who was evidently dissatisfied , were all objec@@ tionable to her and irrit@@ ated her by their words and movements .
'@@ Well , as you like , I don '@@ t care , ' she replied with anno@@ y@@ ance .
again I understand it all , ' Anna said to herself as soon as the carriage started and , roc@@ king slightly , ratt@@ led over the stones ; and again different impressions succeeded one another in her brain .
'@@ What was the last thing I thought of that was so good ? ' she tried to remember it .
Oh yes ! what Y@@ ash@@ vin said : the struggle for existence and hatred are the only things that unite people .
no , you are going in vain , ' she mentally addressed a company of people in a cal@@ è@@ che with four horses , who were evidently going out of town on a sp@@ ree . ' and the dog you have with you won '@@ t help you !
gl@@ ancing in the direction in which Peter was looking she saw a work@@ man , nearly dead @@@ -@@ @ drunk , with his head sw@@ aying about , who was being led off somewhere by a policeman .
'@@ That one is more likely to , ' she thought . ' count V@@ ron@@ sky and I have also been unable to find that pleasure from which we expected so much . '
and now for the first time Anna turned the bright light in which she saw everything upon her relations with him , about which she had always avoided thinking .
not so much love as the satisfaction of his van@@ ity . '
she remembered his words , the expression of his face , sugges@@ tive of a faithful set@@ ter 's , in the early days of their union .
everything now confirmed her view .
'@@ Yes , there was in him the triumph of successful van@@ ity .
of course there was love too ; but the greater part was pride in his success .
he bo@@ asted of me .
now that is past .
not to be proud but to be ashamed !
he has taken from me all he could , and now he does not need me .
he is weary of me and is trying not to act dis@@ hon@@ our@@ ably toward me .
yesterday he betrayed himself - he wants the divorce and a marriage in order to burn his boats .
he loves me , but how ?
'@@ That man wants to aston@@ ish everybody and is very well satisfied with himself , ' she thought , gl@@ ancing at a rosy @@@ -@@ @ faced shop @@@ -@@ @ assistant who was riding a hired horse . ' no , I have no longer the right flav@@ our for him .
if I go away he will , at the bottom of his heart , be pleased . '
that was not a sur@@ mis@@ e . she saw it clearly in the pierc@@ ing light which now revealed to her the meaning of life and of human relations .
'@@ My love grows more and more passionate and e@@ goti@@ stic , and his dwind@@ les and dwind@@ les , and that is why we are separating , ' she went on thinking . ' and there is no remedy .
for me everything centres in him , and I demand that he should give himself up to me more and more completely .
but he wants more and more to get away from me .
before we were united we really drew together ; but now we are irresisti@@ bly drifting apart ; and it C@@ AN@@ NOT be altered .
he tells me I am un@@ reasonably jeal@@ ous , and I have told myself that I am un@@ reasonably jeal@@ ous ; but it is not true .
I am not jeal@@ ous , but dissatisfied . but ... '
and this desire awak@@ ens dis@@ gust in him , and that ar@@ ouses anger in me , and it C@@ AN@@ NOT be otherwise .
Don '@@ t I know that he would not deceive me , that he has no designs on that Sor@@ ok@@ ina , that he is not in love with Kit@@ ty , and will not be un@@ faithful to me ?
I know all that , but that does not make it easier for me .
if , without loving me , he is kind and tender to me from a sense of duty , but what I desire is lacking - that would be a thousand times worse than anger !
it would be hell !
and that is just how it is .
and where love c@@ eases , there hate begins ...
I don '@@ t know these streets at all .
there is no end to them , and they all hate one another .
well , sup@@ posing I picture to myself what I want in order to be happy ?
well , I get divorced , and Alex@@ is Alexand@@ rovich gives me Ser@@ ez@@ ha , and I marry V@@ ron@@ sky ! '
'@@ Well , I get divorced and become V@@ ron@@ sky 's wife !
what then ? will Kit@@ ty cease looking at me as she did this afternoon ?
will Ser@@ ez@@ ha stop asking and wondering about my two husbands ?
and between V@@ ron@@ sky and myself what new feeling can I invent ?
is any kind - not of happiness even , but of absence of torture - possible ? no !
no ! ' she now answered herself without the least hesitation . ' it is impossible !
life is S@@ undering us , and I am the cause of his un@@ happiness and he of mine , and neither he nor I can be made different .
a beg@@ gar woman with a baby .
are we not all flung into the world only to hate each other , and therefore to tor@@ ment ourselves and others ?
Ser@@ ez@@ ha ? ' she remembered . ' I thought I loved him , too , and was touched at my own ten@@ derness for him .
yet I lived without him and exchanged his love for another 's , and did not complain of the change as long as the other love satisfied me . '
and she thought with dis@@ gust of what she called ' the other love . '
the clear@@ ness with which she now saw her own and every one else 's life pleased her .
she had quite forgotten where and why she was going , and only understood the question by a great effort .
'@@ Yes , ' she said , giving him her pur@@ se ; and hanging her little red hand@@ bag on her arm , she descended from the carriage .
as she moved among the crowd toward the first @@@ -@@ @ class waiting @@@ -@@ @ room she gradually recalled all the details of her position and the resolutions between which she vac@@ ill@@ ated .
and then she thought how happy life might still be , and how tor@@ ment@@ ingly she loved and hated him and how dread@@ fully her heart was beating .
two noisy men became quiet as she passed them on the platform , and one of them whispered to the other something about her : something nasty , of course .
she mounted the high step of the railway carriage and seated herself in an empty compartment on the dirty - though once white - cover of the spring seat .
Peter with a stupid smile raised his gold @@@ -@@ @ bra@@ ided hat to take leave of her ; an in@@ sol@@ ent guard s@@ lam@@ med the door to and drew the lat@@ ch .
a mis@@ shap@@ en lady with a bust@@ le ( Anna mentally stripped that woman and was horri@@ fied at her de@@ formity ) and a girl , laughing aff@@ ec@@ tedly , ran past outside .
'@@ Catherine Andre@@ evna has everything , ma tan@@ te ! ' cried the little girl .
in order not to see anyone , she rose quickly and sat down by the opposite window of the empty compartment .
a gri@@ my , mis@@ shaped peasant in a cap from under which his t@@ ous@@ led hair stuck out , passed that window , sto@@ oping over the carriage wheels .
'@@ There is something familiar about that mis@@ shaped peasant , ' she thought .
and remembering her dream she went to the opposite door , trembling with f@@ right .
the guard opened it to let in a husband and wife .
she went back to her corner and sat down .
the couple sat down opposite her , attentively but ste@@ al@@ th@@ ily examining her dress .
both the husband and the wife seemed to Anna disgu@@ sting .
the husband asked if she would allow him to smoke ; evidently not because he wanted to , but to enter into conversation with her .
having received her permission , he began speaking to his wife in French , about things he wanted to speak about still less than he wanted to smoke .
they talked nonsense in@@ sincerely , only in order that she should hear them .
and it was impossible not to hate such ugly w@@ ret@@ ches .
she heard the second bell ring , and then a moving of luggage , noise , shouting and laughter .
it was so clear to Anna that no one had any cause for joy that this laughter jar@@ red on her painfully , and she wished to stop her ears , not to hear it .
'@@ It would be interesting to ask him what he means by it , ' thought Anna , regarding him sp@@ it@@ efully .
Anna forgot her fellow @@@ -@@ @ travellers ; softly roc@@ ked by the motion of the carriage and inhal@@ ing the fresh air , she again began to think :
'@@ Where did I leave off ?
but when you see the truth , what are you to do ? '
'@@ R@@ eason has been given to man to enable him to escape from his troubles , ' said the lady , in French , evidently pleased with her phrase and min@@ cing with her tongue .
these words seemed to answer Anna 's thought .
'@@ To escape from his troubles , ' Anna mentally repeated .
and gl@@ ancing at the red @@@ -@@ @ che@@ e@@ ked husband and his thin wife , she saw that the sick@@ ly wife considered herself misunderstood , and that the husband deceived her and encouraged her in her opinion of herself .
directing her search@@ light upon them , Anna thought she saw their story and all the hidden rec@@ esses of their souls .
but there was nothing of interest there , and she continued her reflections .
'@@ Yes , it troubles me very much , and reason was given us to enable us to escape ; therefore I must escape !
why not put out the candle , if there is nothing more to look at ? if everything is re@@ pul@@ sive to look at ?
why did that guard run past holding the hand@@ rail ? why are those young men in the next carriage shouting ?
why are they talking and laughing ?
it 's all un@@ true , all lies , all deception , all evil ! .@@ ...
when the train stopped at the station , Anna got out with the crowd of passengers , and sh@@ unning them as if they were le@@ pers , stopped on the platform trying to remember why she had come there and what she had intended to do .
everything that had appeared possible before was now so difficult to grasp , especially in this noisy crowd of o@@ dious people who would not leave her in peace .
recoll@@ ecting that she meant to go on if there was no reply , she stopped a porter and asked him whether there was not a co@@ ach@@ man bringing a note from Count V@@ ron@@ sky there .
some one from there was here just now , to meet the Princess Sor@@ ok@@ ina and her daughter .
what is the co@@ ach@@ man like ? '
she opened it , and her heart sank even before she read it .
'@@ Very sorry the note did not catch me .
I shall be back at ten , ' V@@ ron@@ sky wrote in a ca@@ reless hand .
'@@ Yes , I expected it ! ' she said to herself with a malicious smile .
'@@ all right , you may go home , ' she said softly to Michael .
she spoke softly , because the rapid beating of her heart impeded her breathing .
the young men did not leave her in peace .
gaz@@ ing into her face and laughing and shouting un@@ naturally they again passed by .
the station@@ master asked her in passing whether she was going on .
a boy selling k@@ vas fixed his eyes on her .
'@@ o God ! where am I to go ? ' she thought , walking further and further along the platform .
some ladies and children , who had come to meet a spectac@@ led gentleman and were laughing and talking nois@@ ily , became silent and gaz@@ ed at her as she passed them .
she walked faster away from them to the very end of the platform .
a goods train was approaching .
the platform shook , and it seemed to her as if she were again in the tram .
suddenly remembering the man who had been run over the day she first met V@@ ron@@ sky , she realized what she had to do .
quickly and lightly descending the steps that led from the water @@@ -@@ @ tank to the rails , she stopped close to the passing tram .
a feeling seized her like that she had experienced when preparing to enter the water in bathing , and she crossed herself .
and at the same moment she was horror @@@ -@@ @ struck at what she was doing .
'@@ Where am I ?
what am I doing ?
she wished to rise , to throw herself back , but something huge and relentless struck her on the head and dragged her down .
'@@ God forgive me everything ! ' she said , feeling the impossibility of struggling ...
a little peasant mut@@ tering something was working at the rails .
part VIII
it was already the middle of the hot summer , but Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev was only now preparing to leave Moscow .
in Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev 's life during that time events of importance for him had taken place .
his book , the result of six years ' labour , entitled , An At@@ temp@@ t to Review the F@@ ound@@ ations and Forms of Government of Europe and Russia , had been finished a year ago .
the book had been issued last year after careful revision , and had been sent out to the book@@ sellers .
in Society , now particularly occupied with something else , absolute indifference re@@ igned .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev had calculated exactly the time necessary for a review to be written ; but a month passed , and another , and the silence continued .
at last , in the third month , a criticism appeared in a serious magazine .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev knew the author of the article .
the author was a very young and sick@@ ly journalist ; very bold as a writer , but extremely un@@ educated , and shy in personal intercourse .
despite his entire contempt for this man , Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev began reading the review most respec@@ tfully .
the critic had evidently understood the book in an impossible way .
all this was put with so much w@@ it that Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev himself would not have been averse to wiel@@ ding it ; and that was what was dreadful .
'@@ Did not I offend him in some way ? ' he asked himself .
and remembering how when he met him he had corrected the young man 's use of a word that betrayed ignorance Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev found an explanation of the article .
that review was followed by dead silence both in print and in conversation concerning the book , and Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev saw that his six years ' work , carried out with so much devotion and labour , was entirely thrown away .
his position was the more painful because , having finished his book , he no longer had any literary work such as had previously occupied the greater part of his time .
he was intelligent , well @@@ -@@ @ educated , healthy and active , but did not know how to employ his energy .
among the people to whom he belonged , nothing was written or talked about at that time except the Serbian war .
with much that was spoken and written on the subject Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev did not agree in detail .
he admitted that the papers published much that was unnecessary and exaggerated with the sole aim of drawing attention to themselves , each out@@ crying the other .
he saw there was much that was fri@@ vol@@ ous and ridiculous ; but he also saw and admitted the un@@ questionable and ever @@@ -@@ @ growing enthusiasm which was uniting all classes of society , and with which one could not help sympath@@ izing .
the massacre of our co @@@ -@@ @ religi@@ onists and brother Slavs ev@@ oked sympathy for the suffer@@ ers and indignation against their op@@ pres@@ sors .
and the hero@@ ism of the Serbs and Montenegr@@ ins , fighting for a great cause , aroused in the whole nation a desire to help their brothers not only with words but by deeds .
also there was an accompanying fact that pleased Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev . it was the manifestation of public opinion .
the nation had definitely expressed its wishes .
the more he went into this question , the clearer it seemed to him that it was a matter which would attain enormous proportions and become epoch @@@ -@@ @ making .
he devoted himself completely to the service of that great movement and forgot to think about his book .
his whole time was now so taken up that he was unable to answer all the letters and demands addressed to him .
Kat@@ av@@ asov , who had promised Levin to visit him , and had long been meaning to keep that promise , accompanied Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev .
one of the ladies who had met the Volun@@ te@@ ers spoke to Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev at the exit from the waiting @@@ -@@ @ room .
'@@ You too have come to see them off ? ' she asked in French .
and do you always come to see them off ? ' he asked with a slight smile .
'@@ How can one help it ? ' replied the Princess . ' is it true that eight hundred have already gone from here ?
'@@ More than eight hundred : counting those who did not go from Moscow direct , more than a thousand , ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev .
I said so ! ' the lady said joy@@ fully . ' and is@@ n '@@ t it true that about a million roubles have been collected ? '
'@@ Yes , I read it , ' he answered .
they were talking of the latest tel@@ eg@@ ram , confirming the report that for three consecutive days the Turks had been beaten at all points and were in flight , and that a decisive battle was expected next day .
'@@ Oh , I say ! there is a splendid young man who wants to go .
I don '@@ t know why they are making difficulties .
I wished to speak to you about him . I know him , please write a note for him !
having obtained such details as the Princess could give about the young peti@@ tion@@ er , Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev went into the first @@@ -@@ @ class waiting @@@ -@@ @ room , wrote a note to the person on whom the decision depended , and gave it to the Princess .
'@@ Do you know that the well @@@ -@@ @ known Count V@@ ron@@ sky is going by this train ? ' remarked the Princess with a triumph@@ ant and significant smile , when Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev had found her again and given her the note .
'@@ i heard he was going , but did not know when .
going by this train ? '
he is here . only his mother is seeing him off .
after all , it is the best thing he could do . '
'@@ Oh yes , certainly . '
while they were speaking the crowd rushed past them toward the dining @@@ -@@ @ table .
every one shouted ' Z@@ hi@@ vio ! ' and a fresh crowd surged into the refresh@@ ment @@@ -@@ @ room , nearly knocking the Princess off her feet .
what do you think of that ! ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky , be@@ aming with a joy@@ ous smile , as he suddenly appeared in the midst of the crowd . ' was@@ n '@@ t it fin@@ ely and cor@@ di@@ ally expressed !
Bra@@ vo ! ...
'@@ no , I am just going . '
'@@ To my brother 's in the country , ' answered Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev .
'@@ Then you 'll see my wife ; I have written to her , but you 'll see her sooner . please tell her you have seen me and it 's all right !
however , tell her , if you 'll be so kind , that I am appointed Member of the Committee of the Joint ...
did I tell you ? '
'@@ Yes , I have heard , ' replied Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev reluctantly .
'@@ What a pity you are going away , ' said O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky . ' to @@@ -@@ @ mor@@ row we are giving a dinner to two of those who are going to the war : Dmitry B@@ art@@ ny@@ ansky from Petersburg and our V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky - Vas@@ enka .
V@@ es@@ lov@@ sky married recently .
the Princess without repl@@ ying glanced at Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev .
but the fact that Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev and the Princess seemed to wish to get rid of him did not ab@@ ash O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky in the least .
he looked smil@@ ingly now at the fe@@ ather on the Princess 's bon@@ net and now about him , as if trying to remember something .
noticing a lady with a collecting @@@ -@@ @ box he bec@@ k@@ oned to her and put in a five @@@ -@@ @ rouble note .
'@@ i can '@@ t look calmly at those collecting @@@ -@@ @ boxes while I have any money , ' he remarked . ' and what a tel@@ eg@@ ram that was to @@@ -@@ @ day !
'@@ You don '@@ t say so ! ' he exclaimed , when the Princess told him that V@@ ron@@ sky was going by that train .
'@@ With all his faults one must do him justice , ' the Princess said to Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev as soon as O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky had left them . ' his is a thoroughly Russian , Slav@@ onic nature !
only I 'm afraid it will be painful for V@@ ron@@ sky to see him .
say what you will , that man 's fate touches me .
'@@ Yes , I might if opportunity offers . '
but this at@@ ones for much .
the bell rang .
everybody thr@@ ong@@ ed toward the door .
'@@ There he is ! ' said the Princess , pointing to V@@ ron@@ sky who , in a long over@@ coat and a black broad @@@ -@@ @ bri@@ m@@ med hat , was passing with his mother on his arm .
O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky walked beside him , talking with animation .
V@@ ron@@ sky was fro@@ w@@ ning and looking straight before him , as if not hearing what O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky was saying
probably at O@@ bl@@ on@@ sky 's indication , he looked round to where Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev and the Princess were standing and silently raised his hat .
on the platform ' God save the Tsar ' was struck up , followed by ' hur@@ rah ' and ' zhi@@ vio ' !
one of the Volun@@ te@@ ers , a tall , hollow @@@ -@@ @ ch@@ ested , very young man , was b@@ owing in a specially noticeable way , wav@@ ing over his head a felt hat and a bou@@ quet .
from behind him two officers and an elderly man with a large beard and a gre@@ asy cap thrust their heads out , and also bowed .
having taken LE@@ AV@@ E OF THE Princess , Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev with Kat@@ av@@ asov , who had joined him , entered the very crowded carriage , and the train started .
at the Ts@@ ar@@ itsy@@ no station the train was met by a melo@@ dious choir of young people singing Slav@@ sya .
[ a patriotic song . ] Again the Volun@@ te@@ ers bowed and thrust their heads out , but Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev did not pay attention to them : he had had so much to do with Volun@@ te@@ ers that he was already familiar with their general type and it did not interest him .
Kat@@ av@@ asov , however , whose scientific occupations had offered him no opportunities of studying the Volun@@ te@@ ers , was much interested in them and questioned Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev about them .
at the next station Kat@@ av@@ asov followed this advice .
as soon as the train stopped he changed carriages and made acquaintance with the Volun@@ te@@ ers .
he was evidently drunk and was speaking of something that had happened at his school .
opposite him sat an officer , no longer young , wearing a military jacket of the Austrian Guards .
he listened smil@@ ingly to the young man and tried to stop him .
the third Volun@@ te@@ er , wearing an artillery uniform , sat beside them on a trunk .
getting into conversation with the young man , Kat@@ av@@ asov learnt that he had been a rich Moscow merchant but had run through a large fortune before he was twenty @@@ -@@ @ two .
another , a retired officer , also produced an unpleasant impression on Kat@@ av@@ asov .
he was , apparently , a man who had tried everything .
he had had a post on the railway , been a ste@@ ward , and had started factories , and he talked about it all quite need@@ lessly , using inappropriate technical terms .
he was a modest , quiet man , who evidently deferred to the knowledge of the retired Gu@@ ard@@ sman and to the heroic self @@@ -@@ @ sacrifice of the merchant and did not talk at all about himself .
when Kat@@ av@@ asov asked him what prompted him to go to Serbia , he modest@@ ly replied :
one must help the Serbs .
'@@ Yes , it 's particularly artill@@ er@@ y@@ men they are short of , ' said Kat@@ av@@ asov .
'@@ But I have not served long in the artillery : perhaps they will put me in the infantry or cav@@ alry . '
'@@ Why into the infantry , when they need artill@@ er@@ y@@ men most of all ? ' said Kat@@ av@@ asov , concluding from the artill@@ er@@ y@@ man 's age that he must have risen to a considerable rank .
'@@ i did not serve in the artillery long . I am a retired Cad@@ et , ' he said , and began to explain why he had not passed the examination for a commission .
all this put together produced on Kat@@ av@@ asov a dis@@ agre@@ eable impression , and when the Volun@@ te@@ ers got out at a station to have a drink he wished to verify this un@@ favourable impression by a talk with somebody .
one of the passengers , an old man in a military over@@ coat , had been listening all the time to Kat@@ av@@ asov 's conversation with the Volun@@ te@@ ers . when they were left alone together Kat@@ av@@ asov addressed him .
'@@ What a variety there is in the positions of all these men who are going there ! ' Kat@@ av@@ asov remarked vagu@@ ely , wishing to express his own opinion but at the same time to draw the old man .
the old soldier had been through two campaigns .
he knew what a military man ought to be , and by the appearance and talk of those men , and by the sw@@ ag@@ ger with which they applied themselves to their fl@@ asks on the way , he considered them bad soldiers .
besides that , he lived in a provincial town and wanted to speak of a discharged soldier of his town who had volunte@@ ered , a drun@@ k@@ ard and thief whom no one would employ any longer .
'@@ Well , men are wanted there , ' he said , with laughing eyes .
and so they parted without either of them having expressed his opinion .
Kat@@ av@@ asov returning to his carriage involun@@ tarily prev@@ ar@@ icated ; and in telling Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev his observations of the Volun@@ te@@ ers , let it appear that they were excellent fellows .
when THE train ST@@ OP@@ PE@@ D at the Prov@@ in@@ cial capital , Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , instead of going to the refresh@@ ment @@@ -@@ @ room , walked up and down the platform .
the first time he passed the V@@ ron@@ sk@@ ys ' compartment he noticed that the blind was down .
but the next time he passed he saw the old Countess at the window .
'@@ Yes , so I heard , ' replied Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , stopping by her window and gl@@ ancing inside . ' what a fine action this is of his ! ' he added , noticing that V@@ ron@@ sky was not there .
'@@ Yes , but after his mis@@ fortune what could he do ? '
'@@ What a dreadful occurrence ! ' remarked Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev .
'@@ Oh , what I have endured !
Oh , what I have endured ! ' she repeated when Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev had entered and taken a seat beside her . ' you C@@ AN@@ NOT imagine it !
for six weeks he spoke to no one and ate only when I implo@@ red him to .
one could not leave him a moment alone .
we took away everything that he could kill himself with . we lived on the ground floor , but one could not tell what he might do .
you know he had once before shot himself on her account ? ' she said , and the old woman 's brows knit at the recoll@@ ection . ' yes , she ended as such a woman deserved to end .
even the death she chose was mean and low . '
'@@ It is not for us to judge , Countess , ' Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev remarked with a sigh , ' but I understand how dist@@ ressing it was for you . '
I was living on my estate and he was with me .
in the evening I had only just gone to my room when my Mary told me that at the station a lady had thrown herself under a train .
I felt as if I had received a blow ! - I knew it was she !
the first thing I said was : " Don '@@ t tell him ! "
his co@@ ach@@ man had been there and saw it all .
when I ran to his room he was beside himself - it was terrible to see him .
I don '@@ t know what happened there , but they brought him back like a corpse .
I should not have known him .
then came ra@@ ving madness , almost ! ... Ah , one can '@@ t speak of it ! ' exclaimed the Countess with a gesture of her arm .
only to prove something unusual .
she ruined herself and two splendid men - her husband and my unfortunate son . '
'@@ And how about her husband ? ' inqui@@ red Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev .
Alex@@ is at first agreed to everything .
but now he is greatly distressed at having given up his daughter to a stranger .
but he can '@@ t go back on his word .
K@@ aren@@ in came to the funeral ; but we tried to arrange so that he and Alex@@ is should not meet .
for him , the husband , it is better .
but my poor son had given himself up to her entirely .
he had thrown up everything - his career , me ; and then she did not even pity him , but deliberately dealt him a de@@ ath@@ blow .
no , say what you will , her death itself was the death of a hor@@ rid woman , without religion .
God forgive me ! I C@@ AN@@ NOT help h@@ ating her memory when I see my son 's ruin ! '
'@@ But how is he now ? '
'@@ It is a God @@@ -@@ @ sent help for us , this Serbian war !
I am an old woman and understand nothing about it , but for him it is a god@@ send .
but it can '@@ t be helped !
his friend , Y@@ ash@@ vin , had lost everything at cards and was going to Serbia .
he came to see him and persuaded him to go .
now it interests him .
please have a talk with him . I want him to have some distraction .
Un@@ luckily , too , his teeth have started aching .
but he will be very glad to see you .
please have a talk with him . he is walking about on the other side . '
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev said he would be very pleased , and crossed over to the other platform .
in THE slan@@ ting SH@@ AD@@ O@@ W of a pile of s@@ acks he@@ aped up on the platform , V@@ ron@@ sky , in a long over@@ coat , his hat pulled down low and his hands in his pockets , was walking up and down like an animal in a cage , turning sharply every twenty p@@ aces .
to Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev as he approached it seemed that V@@ ron@@ sky saw but pre@@ tended not to see him .
he was above any personal considerations with V@@ ron@@ sky .
in his eyes V@@ ron@@ sky at that moment seemed an important worker in a great cause , and Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev considered it his duty to encourage and che@@ er him .
he went up to him .
V@@ ron@@ sky paused , looked at Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , recognized him , and advancing a few steps to meet him , pressed his hand very very hard .
'@@ Per@@ haps you did not wish to see me , ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , ' but can I not be of some use to you ? '
'@@ There is no one whom it would be less unpleasant for me to meet than yourself , ' returned V@@ ron@@ sky . ' excuse me .
'@@ Oh no ! ' replied V@@ ron@@ sky , as if it cost him an effort to understand . ' if you don '@@ t mind , let us walk up and down .
a letter ?
no thank you . no introduc@@ tions are needed to enable one to die !
unless indeed to the Turks ! ... ' he added , smiling with his lips only .
his eyes retained their expression of angry suffering .
'@@ Yes , but it may be easier for you to establish connections ( which will be necessary anyway ) with some one who has been prepared .
I was very glad to hear of your decision .
the Volun@@ te@@ ers are being very much attacked and a man like yourself will raise them in public opinion . '
I am glad that there is something for which I can lay down the life which I not only do not want , but of which I am sick !
it will be of use to somebody , ' and he moved his jaw impati@@ ently because of the incess@@ ant gn@@ aw@@ ing pain in his tooth , which even prevented him from speaking with the expression he desired .
'@@ You will recover , I proph@@ esy it , ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , feeling touched . ' to free one 's brothers from oppression is an aim worth both dying and living for .
God grant you outward success and inward peace , ' he added , holding out his hand .
the acute pain in the strong tooth , filling his mouth with sali@@ va , hindered his speaking .
suddenly a quite different feeling , not of pain but of tor@@ m@@ enting inward discomfort , made him for a moment forget his tooth@@ ache .
he tried to recall his best moments with her but they were for ever poisoned .
he ceased to feel the pain in his tooth , and so@@ bs distorted his face .
having twice walked past the s@@ acks and mastered himself , he turned calmly to Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev :
'@@ You have not seen any tel@@ eg@@ ram later than yesterday 's ?
and having spoken about the proposed pro@@ clamation of Milan as King and of the immense results this might have , they returned to their respective carriages after the second bell had already sounded .
'A@@ ren '@@ t you ashamed of yourself for not letting us know ? ' she said , holding out her hand to him and offering her forehead for a kiss .
'@@ We got here first @@@ -@@ @ rate without troubling you , ' replied Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev . ' I am so dusty that I dare not touch you .
I was so busy that I did not know when I could tear myself away .
and you , as usual , ' said he ; smiling , ' are enjoying tran@@ qui@@ l happiness outside the currents in your peaceful shadows .
'@@ But I am not a ne@@ gr@@ o ! when I have had a wash I shall look like a human being ! ' Kat@@ av@@ asov said in his usual j@@ esting way , holding out his hand and smiling , his teeth looking particularly bright in contrast with his black face .
'@@ Ko@@ st@@ ya will be so pleased !
'@@ Always busy with his hus@@ band@@ ry !
" in the sh@@ allows " hits it exactly , ' remarked Kat@@ av@@ asov . ' and we in town can see nothing but the Serbian war !
surely not the same as other people ? '
'@@ Oh , nothing in particular - the same as everybody , ' Kit@@ ty answered , rather embarrassed and gl@@ ancing round at Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev . ' well , I 'll send for him .
'@@ It 's Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich and Kat@@ av@@ asov , the Professor , ' said she .
'@@ Oh , how trying in this heat ! ' said the Prince .
'@@ no , Pap@@ a , he is very nice , and Ko@@ st@@ ya is very fond of him , ' Kit@@ ty replied with a smile as of ent@@ reat@@ y , having noticed a sar@@ cas@@ tic expression on her father 's face .
'@@ You go and entertain them , dear , ' Kit@@ ty said to her sister .
and I will run to Mit@@ ya .
he will be awake now and is certainly screaming . ' and feeling the flow of milk , she went with rapid steps to the nur@@ sery .
it was not a mere guess - the bond between herself and the baby had not yet been sever@@ ed - and she knew surely by the flow of milk within herself that he was wanting food .
and so he was .
it was a fine healthy voice , only hungry and impati@@ ent .
the baby was convul@@ sed with hungry y@@ ells .
'@@ But one must , you know , ma '@@ am , ' said Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na , who was almost always in the nur@@ sery . ' he must be properly ti@@ died up !
go@@ o ! go@@ o ! ' she coo@@ ed to him , paying no attention to the mother .
at last , after desperate screaming and cho@@ king , matters went smoothly , and both mother and child felt cal@@ med and were silent .
'@@ It 's impossible !
if he knew anyone it would be me , ' Kit@@ ty replied to Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na 's statement , and smiled .
when I do like that , he quite bri@@ ghten@@ s up , the dear !
he bri@@ ghten@@ s up like a sunny morning , ' said Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na .
'@@ Well , all right , all right ! we shall see , ' Kit@@ ty whispered . ' but now go away , he is falling asleep . '
if God would only , send a little rain ! ' she said .
this hand disturbed Kit@@ ty ; she wanted to kiss it , but was afraid to do so lest she should wake her baby .
at last the arm ceased wav@@ ing and the eyes closed .
only now and then the baby , continuing his business , lifted his long cur@@ ved l@@ ashes and looked at his mother with mo@@ ist eyes that seemed black in the dim light .
I expect he has gone to the api@@ ary again .
though I am sorry that he goes there so often , yet I am also glad of it .
he is more cheerful now than he was in spring .
then he was so gloomy , and suffered so much , that I was becoming al@@ armed about him .
and how funny he is ! ' she whispered with a smile .
it was his want of faith .
'@@ Why has he been reading those philosop@@ hies for a whole year ? ' she thought . ' if it 's all written in those books , he can understand it .
if what they say is un@@ true , why read them ?
he says himself that he would like to believe .
then why does he not believe ?
it must be because he thinks too much .
he can '@@ t talk to us about everything .
I think he will be glad of these visitors , especially of Kat@@ av@@ asov .
he likes arguing with them , ' she reflected , and then turned her mind to the problem of where she had better arrange for Kat@@ av@@ asov to sleep - in a separate room or with Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev ?
and here a thought suddenly struck her which made her start with excitement and even disturb Mit@@ ya , who gave her a severe look in consequence .
'@@ i don '@@ t think the laun@@ dress has brought the things back and the spare sheets are all in use .
if I don '@@ t see to it , Ag@@ atha Mikha@@ y@@ lov@@ na will give Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich used bed @@@ -@@ @ linen ! ' and the very thought of this sent the blood into Kit@@ ty 's face .
'@@ Yes , I must see about it , ' she decided , and returning to her former train of thought she remembered that there was something important , something spiritual , that she had not yet thought out and tried to recoll@@ ect what it was .
'@@ Oh yes ! Ko@@ st@@ ya is an un@@ believer , ' she thought again with a smile .
'@@ Well , he is an un@@ believer !
better let him be that than be like Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l , or like what I wanted to be when I was abroad .
no , he will never pretend . '
then a recent proof of his kindness came vivi@@ dly to her mind .
two weeks before , Dol@@ ly had received a penit@@ ent letter from her husband .
he implo@@ red her to save his honour and to sell her estate to pay his debts .
Dol@@ ly was in despair ; she hated her husband , desp@@ ised him , p@@ iti@@ ed him , made up her mind to divorce him and to refuse ; but ended by con@@ sent@@ ing to sell part of her estate .
and his dre@@ ad of hurting anybody 's feelings , even a child 's !
everything for others , nothing for himself !
Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich quite regards it as Ko@@ st@@ ya 's duty to act as his ste@@ ward , and so does his sister .
and now Dol@@ ly and her children are his wards !
and then there are all those peasants who come to him every day as if it were his business to help them .
'@@ Yes , only be like your father , only be like him ! ' she whispered , giving Mit@@ ya to the nurse , and touching his cheek with her lips .
from that moment , without thinking about it and though he continued living as he had done her@@ et@@ o@@ fore , Levin never ceased to feel afraid of his ignorance .
moreover , he was vagu@@ ely conscious that what he had called his convictions were really ignorance and , more than that , were a state of mind which rendered knowledge of what he needed impossible .
for him the problem was this : ' if I don '@@ t accept the replies offered by Christianity to the questions my life presents , what solutions do I accept ? '
and he not only failed to find in the whole arsenal of his convictions any kind of answer , but he could not even find anything resembling an answer .
he was in the position of a man seeking for food in a to@@ y@@ shop or at a gun@@ sm@@ ith 's .
involun@@ tarily and unconsciously , in every book , in every conversation , and in every person he met , he now sought for their relation to those questions and for a solution to them .
and he studied pain@@ stak@@ ingly both the opinions of those people and the books which contained their answers .
besides , during the time of his wife 's confin@@ ement an extraordinary thing had happened to him .
he , an un@@ believer , began X@@ O pray , and while praying believed .
but that moment had passed , and he could not al@@ lot any place in his life to the state of mind he had then experienced .
he was painfully out of harmony with himself and strained all his spiritual powers to escape from this condition .
these TH@@ O@@ U@@ G@@ HT@@ S oppressed arid tor@@ m@@ ented him , now more and now less strongly , but never left him .
he read and thought , and the more he read and thought the further he felt from his goal .
his brother Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev advised him to read Hom@@ y@@ akov 's theological writings .
Levin read the second volume of them , and in spite of its pol@@ em@@ ical , polished , and wit@@ ty style , which at first rep@@ elled him , he was struck by its teaching about the Church .
he was struck by the thought that it is not given to isolated man to attain divine truth , but that it is given to a community united by love - the Church .
all that spring he was not himself and experienced terrible moments .
'@@ Without knowing what I am , and why I am here it is impossible to live .
yet I C@@ AN@@ NOT know that and therefore I can '@@ t live , ' he said to himself .
'@@ in an infinity of time , and in infinity of matter , in infinite space , a bubble , a bubble organism , separates itself , and that bubble maintains itself a@@ while and then bursts , and that bubble is - I ! '
this was a dist@@ ressing false@@ hood , but it was the sole and last result of centuries and the age @@@ -@@ @ long labour of human thought in that direction .
but it was not only false , it was the cruel mock@@ ery of some evil power : a wicked and disgu@@ sting Power , and one to which it was impossible to submit .
it was necessary to free oneself from that Power .
an end had to be put to that dependence on an evil power ; and there was one means - death .
and though he was a happy and healthy family man , Levin was several times so near to suicide that he hid a cord he had lest he should hang himself , and he feared to carry a gun lest he should shoot himself .
but he did not hang or shoot himself and went on living .
now , as if involun@@ tarily , he cut ever deeper and deeper into the earth , so that he , like a pl@@ ough@@ share , could not get out without turning the so@@ d .
for the family to live as their grand@@ fathers and fathers had been accustomed to live , that is at the same educational level , and so to bring up their children , was undoubtedly necessary .
it was just as necessary as to dine when hungry ; and therefore just as it was necessary to prepare dinner , so it was necessary to arrange the hus@@ band@@ ry at Pok@@ rovsk in such a way as to derive an income from it .
to do this he must not lease the land , but must farm it himself , keep cattle , man@@ ure the fields , and plant woods .
all this , with game @@@ -@@ @ shooting , and his new hobby of be@@ e@@ keeping , filled up the whole of that life of his which seemed to him , when he thought about it , to have no meaning .
but besides knowing definitely what he had to do , Levin also knew how to do it all , and which affair was the more important of any two .
he knew that he must hire lab@@ our@@ ers as cheaply as possible ; but that he must not take them in bond@@ age for less than they were worth by advancing them money , though this would be very profitable .
he might sell straw to the peasants in a time of shortage , though he felt sorry for them ; but an inn or a public @@@ -@@ @ house , although it brought in a revenue , must be done away with .
f@@ elling trees must be punished as severely as possible , but if peasants let their cattle str@@ ay he must not extract fines from them ; and though it griev@@ ed the watch@@ men and weakened discipline , the str@@ ayed cattle must not be detained .
he must lend money to Peter to liberate him from the usur@@ ers to whom he was paying ten per cent@@ . a month ; but he must neither reduce or postpone the payments of rent by the peasants who were in default .
the ste@@ ward must not be exc@@ used when the small me@@ adow was not m@@ own and the grass was wasted ; but grass must not be m@@ own on the eighty des@@ y@@ at@@ inas which had been planted with young trees .
whether he was acting well or ill he did not know and far from laying down the law about it , he now avoided talking or thinking about it .
thinking about it led him into doubts and prevented him from seeing what he should and should not do .
the DA@@ Y WH@@ EN KO@@ Z@@ NY@@ SH@@ E@@ V arrived at Pok@@ rovsk was one of Levin 's most dist@@ ressing days .
and this is done every year , all over Russia .
having lived most of his life in the country and in close contact with the peasants , Levin always felt , at this busy time , that this general stimulation of the peasants communicated itself to him .
'@@ Why is all this being done ? ' he wondered . ' why am I standing here , obli@@ ging them to work ?
why do they all make such efforts and try to show me their zeal ?
yet he loos@@ ens the she@@ aves and gives directions , sh@@ outs at the women , and quickly puts right the str@@ ap on the fly @@@ -@@ @ wheel .
and , moreover , not they only but I too shall be buried and nothing will be left .
he thought this , and at the same time looked at his watch to calculate how much they could th@@ resh in an hour .
he had to know this in order to set them their day 's task accordingly .
Theodore , black with the dust that stuck to his per@@ spir@@ ing face , shouted something in reply , but still did not do as Levin wished .
Levin went up to the roller , mo@@ tioned Theodore aside and himself began feeding the machine .
Theodore came from the farther village , the one where Levin had formerly let the land to be worked co @@@ -@@ @ oper@@ atively .
at present it was let to the in@@ n@@ keeper .
Levin got into conversation with Theodore about that land , and asked whether Plato , a well @@@ -@@ @ to @@@ -@@ @ do@@ . and worthy peasant of that village , would not rent that land next year .
'@@ the rent is too high , Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich , ' answered Theodore , picking out the ears of ry@@ e from the front of his damp shirt .
'@@ But how does Kir@@ ilov make it pay ? '
'@@ Why shoul@@ d@@ n '@@ t Mit@@ yu@@ ka ' ( as he cont@@ emp@@ tu@@ ously called the in@@ n@@ keeper ) ' make it pay , Constan@@ tine Dmit@@ rich ?
but as if D@@ addy Plato would ever skin a man ! he 'll lend , and sometimes let a man off , and so run short himself .
'@@ But why should he let anyone off ? '
Oh well , you see , people differ ! one man lives only for his own needs : take Mit@@ yu@@ ka , who only stuffs his own belly , but Plato is an upright old man .
he lives for his soul and remembers God . '
'@@ You know how : rightly , in a go@@ dly way .
you know , people differ !
take you , for instance , you won '@@ t inj@@ ure anyone either ... '
'@@ Yes , yes ! good @@@ -@@ @ bye ! ' uttered Levin , gas@@ ping with excitement , and turning away , he took his stick and walked quickly away toward home .
Levin W@@ ENT AL@@ ON@@ G THE H@@ IG@@ H @@@ -@@ @ RO@@ AD with long strides , attending not so much to his thoughts - he could not yet dis@@ ent@@ angle them - as to a condition of his soul he had never before experienced .
the words the peasant had spoken produced in his soul the effect of an electric spark , suddenly transforming and welding into one a whole group of dis@@ join@@ ted im@@ potent separate ideas which had always interested him .
these ideas , though he had been unconscious of them , had been in his mind when he was talking about letting the land .
he felt something new in his soul and prob@@ ed this something with pleasure , not yet knowing what it was .
'@@ To live not for one 's needs but for God !
for what God ?
what could be more senseless than what he said ?
and did I not understand those senseless words of Theodore 's ?
and having understood them , did I doubt their justice ? did I find them stupid , vague , or in@@ exact ?
'@@ no , I understood him just as he understands them : understood completely and more clearly than I understand anything in life ; and I have never in my life doubted it , and C@@ AN@@ NOT doubt it . and not I alone but every one - the whole world - only understands that completely .
nobody is free from doubt about other things , but nobody ever doubts this one thing , everybody always agrees with it . { ? ? }
'@@ Theodore says that Kir@@ ilov , the in@@ n@@ keeper , lives for his belly .
we all , as reasoning creatures , C@@ AN@@ NOT live otherwise .
and then that same Theodore says that it is wrong to live for one 's belly , and that we must live for Truth , for God , and at the first hint I understand him !
therefore goodness is beyond the chain of cause and effect .
'@@ It is exactly this that I know and that we all know .
{ ? ? } ' And I sought for miracles , regre@@ tted not to see a miracle that might convince me !
a physical miracle would have tempted me . but here is a miracle , the one possible , everlasting miracle , all around me , and I did not notice it !
'@@ What greater miracle could there be than that ?
that feeling was so joy@@ ous that it seemed questionable to him .
he was breath@@ less with excitement and , incapable of going further , he turned from the road into the wood and sat down on the un@@ cut grass in the shade of the as@@ pens .
taking the hat from his per@@ spir@@ ing head , he lay down , leaning his el@@ bow upon the ju@@ icy , broad @@@ -@@ @ bl@@ aded forest grass .
and in all of us , including the as@@ pens and the clouds and ne@@ bu@@ la@@ e , evolution is proceeding .
un@@ ending evolution and struggle ...
as if there could be any direction and struggle in infinity !
and I was surprised that , in spite of the greatest effort of thought on that path , the meaning of life , the meaning of my impulses and my aspirations , was not revealed to me .
'@@ i have discovered nothing .
I have understood the Power that not only gave me life in the past but is giving me life now .
I have freed myself from deception and learnt to know my Master .
he briefly reviewed the whole course of his thoughts during the last two years , beginning with the clear and obvious thought of death at the sight of his beloved brother hopelessly ill .
but he had done neither the one nor the other , yet he continued to live , think , and feel , had even at that very time got married , experienced many jo@@ ys , and been happy whenever he was not thinking of the meaning of his life .
what did that show ?
he had lived ( without being conscious of it ) by those spiritual truths which he had im@@ bi@@ bed with his mother 's milk ; but in thought he had not only not acknowledged those truths , but had stu@@ di@@ ously ev@@ aded them .
now it was clear to him that he was only able to live , thanks to the beliefs in which he had been brought up .
'@@ What should I have been and how should I have lived my life , if I had not had those beliefs , and had not known that one must live for God , and not for one 's own needs ?
nothing of that which constitutes the chief jo@@ ys of my life would have existed for me . '
and although he made the greatest efforts of imagination , he could not picture to himself the b@@ estial creature he would have been , had he not known what he was living for .
'@@ i looked for an answer to my question .
but reason could not give me an answer - reason is in@@ commensur@@ able with the question .
life itself has given me the answer , in my knowledge of what is good and what is bad .
and that knowledge I did not acquire in any way ; it was given to me as to everybody , given because I could not take it from anywhere .
was it by reason that I attained to the knowledge that I must love my neighbour and not thro@@ t@@ tle him ?
they told me so when I was a child , and I gladly believed it , because they told me what was already in my soul .
but who discovered it ?
reason has discovered the struggle for existence and the law that I must thro@@ t@@ tle all those who hinder the satisfaction of my desires .
but the law of loving others could not be discovered by reason , because it is unreasonable . '
'@@ ah yes ! pride ! ' he said to himself , turning over face down@@ wards and beginning to tie blades of grass into kno@@ ts , trying not to break them .
'@@ And not only mental pride but mental stupidity .
and chiefly ro@@ gu@@ ery of mind , precisely ro@@ gu@@ ery .
just mind @@@ -@@ @ sw@@ ind@@ ling , ' he repeated .
Levin remembered A REC@@ ENT scene between Dol@@ ly and her children .
left by themselves , the children had started cooking r@@ asp@@ berries over a candle , and pouring jets of milk into their mouths .
and Levin was struck by the quiet dull dis@@ belief with which the children listened to these remarks from their mother .
they were only griev@@ ed that their am@@ using game had been ended , and they did not believe a word of what she was saying .
and they could not believe it , because they could not imagine the whole volume of all they consumed , and therefore could not conceive that what they were destroying was the very thing they lived on .
'@@ That 's quite a different matter , ' they thought . ' and not in the least interesting or important , because those things always have been and always will be .
now we 've thought of putting r@@ asp@@ berries in a cup and cooking them over a candle , and of pouring milk into each other 's mouths like foun@@ tains .
that is am@@ using and new , and not at all worse than drinking out of cups . '
'@@ Don '@@ t we , and did@@ n '@@ t I , do just the same , when intellectually I sought for the meaning of the forces of nature and the purpose of human life ? ' he went on thinking .
'@@ Sup@@ posing now that the children were left alone to proc@@ ure or make cups for themselves and to milk the cows and so on .
would they play tricks ?
no , they would die of hunger !
suppose we , with our passions and thoughts , were left without the conception of God a Creator , and without a conception of what is good , and without an explanation of moral evil !
'@@ Tr@@ y to build up anything without these conceptions !
'@@ We destroy because we have our fill spiritually .
'@@ Wh@@ ence comes the joyful knowledge I have in common with the peasant , and which alone gives me peace of mind ?
'@@ Yes , what I know , I know not by my reason but because it has been given to me , revealed to me , and I know it in my heart by faith in the chief thing which the Church pro@@ claims .
Levin repeated to himself . he turned over , and leaning on his el@@ b@@ ows began looking at a herd of cattle in the distance approaching the river on the other side .
'@@ But can I believe in all that the Church prof@@ esses ? ' he asked himself , testing himself by everything which might destroy his present peace of mind .
he purpos@@ ely thought of those teachings of the Church which always seemed most strange to him , and that tried him .
by existence !
by nothing ! - The devil and sin ? - And how do I explain evil ? ...
a Saviour ? ...
'@@ But I know nothing , nothing ! and can know nothing but what is told to me and to everybody . '
and it now seemed to him that there was not one of the dog@@ mas of the Church which could disturb the principal thing - faith in God , in goodness , as the sole vocation of man .
lying on his back he was now gaz@@ ing at the high clou@@ dless sky .
'@@ Don '@@ t I know that that is infinite space , and not a rounded vault ?
Levin ceased to think , and only as it were hear@@ k@@ ened to my@@ stic voices that seemed to be joy@@ ously and ear@@ ne@@ stly discussing something .
that occurred to him only when the co@@ ach@@ man drove up and called to him .
'@@ the mistress has sent me !
your brother and another gentleman have come ! '
Levin got into the trap and took the re@@ ins .
as if just awakened from a dream , it was long before he could collect his thoughts .
his brother , his wife , and the unknown visitor appeared in a different light to him now .
it seemed to him that his relations with every one would now be changed .
'@@ Please leave it alone and don '@@ t teach me ! ' said Levin , anno@@ yed at the co@@ ach@@ man 's interference .
when they were still a quarter of a ver@@ st from the house , Levin saw G@@ ris@@ ha and T@@ anya running toward him .
M@@ ama is coming and Grand@@ pap@@ a and Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich , and some one else ! ' they cried , clam@@ bering into the trap .
'an aw@@ fully dreadful man !
and he goes like that with his hands , ' said T@@ anya , standing up in the trap and mim@@ icking Kat@@ av@@ asov .
'@@ Young or old ? ' asked Levin with a laugh , as T@@ anya 's gestures reminded him of some one .
'@@ Oh , if only it is not some one dis@@ agre@@ eable ! ' he thought .
Kat@@ av@@ asov was very fond of talking about philosophy , having a conception of it which he had acquired from natur@@ alists who had never studied it , and in Moscow Levin had lat@@ terly had many disputes with him .
one of those disputes , in which Kat@@ av@@ asov evidently thought he had been the vic@@ tor , was the first thing Levin remembered when he recognized him .
'@@ But I will not now on any account dispute or express my opinions lightly , ' he thought .
after ali@@ ghting from the trap and welcoming his brother and Kat@@ av@@ asov , Levin asked where Kit@@ ty was .
'@@ She has taken Mit@@ ya to Kola , ' which was a wood not far from the house .
'@@ She wanted to let him sleep there ; it 's so hot in the house , ' said Dol@@ ly .
Levin always advised his wife not to take the child into the wood , considering it dangerous , and this news was dis@@ agre@@ eable to him .
'@@ She w@@ and@@ ers about with him from place to place , ' said the old Prince with a smile . ' I advised her to try taking him to the ice @@@ -@@ @ cellar ! '
'@@ She meant to come to the api@@ ary .
she thought you were there .
'@@ Well , and what are you doing ? ' asked Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , lagging behind with his brother .
'@@ Oh , nothing particular .
busy with the estate as usual , ' answered Levin . ' have you come for a good stay ?
'@@ For about a fort@@ night .
he dropped his own eyes , not knowing what to say .
'@@ Have any reviews of your book appeared ? ' he asked .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev smiled at the obvious intent of the question .
'@@ no one concerns himself with it , and I least of all , ' he replied . ' look there , Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na ! it 's going to rain , ' he added , pointing with his umbrella to some white clouds that had appeared above the asp@@ en trees .
and those words were enough to re @@@ -@@ @ establish between the brothers the not exactly hostile , but cold , relations which Levin so wished to avoid .
'@@ How right you were to come ! ' he said .
'@@ no , I have not finished him , ' replied Levin . ' however , I don '@@ t need him now . '
'@@ Well , I have finally convinced myself that I Sh@@ an '@@ t find solutions of the questions I am concerned about in him , or in people of his kind .
now ... '
but he was suddenly struck by the calm and cheerful expression of Kat@@ av@@ asov 's face , and felt so sorry to lose the spiritual condition which he was evidently spo@@ iling by his conversation , that recoll@@ ecting his resolution he ceased speaking .
'@@ However , we 'll have a talk later on , ' he said . ' if we are going to the api@@ ary , it 's this way , along this path , ' he added , addressing the whole party .
trying to make as few br@@ us@@ que movements as possible and listening to the bees that flew past him more and more often , he went along the path to the hu@@ t .
at the very entrance a bee became ent@@ angled in his beard and began bu@@ zz@@ ing , but he carefully liberated it .
on the other side of the fence an old man was making a hoo@@ p and did not notice Levin , who stopped in the middle of the api@@ ary without calling him .
he was glad of this opportunity to be alone and recover from reality , which had already so lowered his spiritual condition .
he remembered that he had already got angry with Ivan , treated his brother col@@ dly , and spoken he@@ ed@@ lessly to Kat@@ av@@ asov .
'@@ Can it possibly have been but a mom@@ entary mood that will pass without leaving a trace ? ' he wondered .
but at that instant returning into that mood , he felt with joy that something new and important had occurred within him .
reality had temporarily veiled the spiritual tranqu@@ ill@@ ity he had found , but it remained with him .
and as , in spite of the bees , his physical powers remained intact , so his newly realized spiritual powers were intact also .
'@@ KO@@ ST@@ Y@@ A ! do YOU K@@ NO@@ W with whom Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich travelled coming here ? ' said Dol@@ ly , after she had distributed c@@ uc@@ um@@ bers and honey among the children .
'@@ Yes , and not alone , but is taking a squ@@ adron at his own expense ! ' said Kat@@ av@@ asov .
'@@ That is like him , ' said Levin . ' but are Volun@@ te@@ ers really still going ? ' he added with a glance at Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev did not reply , but with the blunt side of a knife carefully extracted from a bowl in which lay a wedge of white honey@@ comb a live bee that had stuck in the running honey .
you should have seen what went on at the station yesterday ! ' said Kat@@ av@@ asov , audi@@ bly b@@ iting into a c@@ uc@@ umber .
'@@ Well , how is one to understand it ?
in heaven 's name , Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich , explain to me where all these Volun@@ te@@ ers are going and whom they are fighting , ' said the old Prince , evidently continuing a conversation that had been started during Levin 's absence .
'@@ the Turks ! ' answered Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , quietly smiling , having extracted the bee which , black with honey , moved its legs hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ly@@ . as he shifted it from the knife to a firm asp@@ en leaf .
'@@ But who has declared war on Turkey ?
Ivan Ivan@@ ich R@@ ago@@ z@@ ov and the Countess Ly@@ dia Ivan@@ ovna , assisted by Mad@@ ame St@@ ah@@ l ? '
'@@ no one has declared war , but people sympath@@ ize with their suffering neighbours and wish to help them , ' replied Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev .
'@@ But the Prince is not talking of help , ' inter@@ posed Levin , taking his father @@@ -@@ @ in @@@ -@@ @ law 's side , ' but of war !
he says that private people C@@ AN@@ NOT take part in war without the consent of the Government . '
'@@ Ko@@ st@@ ya , look ! here 's a bee !
really , we shall get stun@@ g ! ' cried Dol@@ ly , wav@@ ing away a was@@ p .
'@@ But that 's not a bee , it 's a was@@ p , ' said Levin .
'@@ Well , and what is your theory ? ' asked Kat@@ av@@ asov with a smile , evidently challenging Levin to a discussion . ' why have private individuals no right ? '
on the other hand , by law and by common sense , in the affairs of State and especially in the matter of war , citizens renounce their personal will . '
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev and Kat@@ av@@ asov , ready with their rejo@@ inders , began speaking both together .
'@@ That 's just the point , my dear fellow , that cases may arise when the Government does not fulfil the will of its citizens and then Society announces its own will , ' said Kat@@ av@@ asov .
but Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev evidently did not approve of this reply .
our brothers by blood and religion are being killed .
well , say they were not even our brothers or co @@@ -@@ @ religi@@ onists , but simply children , women , and old people ; one 's feelings are outraged , and Russians ha@@ sten to help to stop those horrors .
'@@ But I would not kill the man , ' replied Levin .
if I saw such a thing , I might yield to my instinc@@ tive feeling ; I can '@@ t say beforehand .
'@@ Per@@ haps you have none , but others have , ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev with a dissatisfied fro@@ wn . ' among the people there live traditions of Orthodox Christians suffering under the y@@ oke of the " in@@ fi@@ del Mus@@ sul@@ man . "
'@@ Per@@ haps , ' said Levin ev@@ asi@@ vely , ' but I don '@@ t see it . I myself am one of the people , and I don '@@ t feel it . '
I was much griev@@ ed and thought I was a monster or that the Kar@@ ls@@ bad waters had that effect on me !
but on getting back I was relieved , for I see that there are others besides me who are only interested in Russia and not in their brother @@@ -@@ @ Slavs .
'@@ Personal opinions don '@@ t count in this matter ; ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev . ' it is not an affair of personal opinions , when all Russia - the people - has expressed its will . '
'@@ But , forgive me , I don '@@ t see it .
the people know nothing about it , ' said the Prince .
'@@ But what was there in church on Sunday ?
'@@ the people can '@@ t help knowing . a consciousness of their destiny always exists in the people , and at moments like the present it becomes clear to them , ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev positively , gl@@ ancing at the old be@@ e@@ keeper .
the handsome old man , with a black beard turning grey in places and thick sil@@ very hair , stood mo@@ tionless with a bowl of honey in his hand , gaz@@ ing kindly and calmly down from his height at the gent@@ le@@ folk , clearly neither understanding them nor wishing to understand .
'@@ That 's just so , ' he said to Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , and moved his head significantly .
he neither knows nor thinks about it , ' said Levin . ' have you heard about the war , Mikha@@ yl@@ ich ? ' he asked , addressing the old man .
'@@ What they read in the church ?
'@@ Why should we think ?
Alexander Nikol@@ ay@@ evich , the Emperor , has thought for us , and will think for us on all matters .
he can see better ...
shall I bring some more bread and give the l@@ addi@@ e a bit ? ' he asked Dol@@ ly , pointing to G@@ ris@@ ha , who was finishing his cr@@ ust .
what does that mean ? '
'@@ i tell you it 's not hundreds , and not the happy @@@ -@@ @ go @@@ -@@ @ lucky people , but the best representatives of the people ! ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , as irrit@@ ably as if he were defending the last of his possessions . ' and the donations ?
'@@ That word people is so indefinite , ' said Levin . ' cler@@ ks in district offices , school@@ masters , and one out of a thousand peasants , may know what it is all about .
the rest of the eighty millions , like Mikha@@ yl@@ ich , not only don '@@ t express their will , but have not the least idea what it is they have to express it about !
what right have we then to say it is the will of the people ? '
KO@@ Z@@ NY@@ SH@@ E@@ V , AN experienced dial@@ ec@@ tici@@ an , did not re@@ join but immediately turned the conversation into another region .
'@@ Well , if you want to gauge the national spirit arith@@ me@@ tically , of course that is very difficult to do !
voting has not been introduced in our country , and C@@ AN@@ NOT be because it does not express the people 's will , but there are other means .
not to mention the under@@ currents that have stirred in the mo@@ tionless sea of the nation and which are evident to every un@@ prejud@@ iced person , look at Society in the narrow@@ er sense !
the most divergent parties in the intellectual world , previously so hostile to one another , have all merged into one .
all differences are at an end , and all the social organs say one and the same thing , all have felt an el@@ emental force that has seized them and carries them all in one direction . '
'@@ Yes , all the papers say the same thing , ' said the Prince , ' that 's true .
so much the same that they are just like fro@@ gs before a storm !
they prevent our hearing anything else ! '
'@@ Fro@@ gs or no fro@@ gs ... I don '@@ t publish a newspaper and don '@@ t want to defend them , but I am speaking of the unanim@@ ity of the intelligent world , ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev , turning to his brother . Levin was going to reply , but the old Prince interrupted him .
'@@ Yes , he asked me to tell Dar@@ ya Alexand@@ rov@@ na that he has got the post , ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev dis@@ cont@@ ent@@ edly , considering that what the Prince was saying was not to the point .
'@@ So it is with the unanim@@ ity of the Press .
it has been explained to me : as soon as there is a war their revenue is doubled .
how can they help considering that the fate of the people and the Slavs - and all the rest of it ? '
'@@ There are many papers I don '@@ t like , but that is unfair , ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev .
'@@ i would make only one stipul@@ ation , ' continued the Prince . ' Alph@@ on@@ se Kar@@ r put it very well , before the war with Prussia .
" you think war unavoidable .
he who pre@@ aches war - off with him in a special legi@@ on to the assault , to the attack , in front of everybody else ! " -@@ '
'@@ the editors would be fine ! ' remarked Kat@@ av@@ asov , laughing loudly , and pic@@ turing to himself the editors of his acquaintance in that chosen legi@@ on .
'@@ Oh , but they 'd run away , ' said Dol@@ ly , ' and only be a hind@@ r@@ ance . '
'@@ And if they run , put grap@@ es@@ hot behind them , or Cossacks with whi@@ ps ! ' said the Prince .
'@@ That is a joke , and excuse me , Prince , not a good joke , ' said Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev .
'@@ i don '@@ t see that it is a joke , that ... ' began Levin , but Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev interrupted him .
'@@ Every member of Society is called upon to do his proper task , ' he said . ' and men of thought perform theirs by expressing public opinion .
the unanimous and complete expression of public opinion is a service rendered by the Press , and is also a grati@@ fying phenomenon .
twenty years ago we should have been silent , but now we hear the voice of the Russian people , who are ready to arise as one man and to sacrifice themselves for their oppressed brethren . that is a great step and a sign of power ! '
you know that expression is a puzz@@ ling one for a natur@@ alist .
what is a soul ? ' Kat@@ av@@ asov inqui@@ red with a smile .
'@@ Oh , you know ! '
'@@ no , I swear I have not the slightest idea ! ' said Kat@@ av@@ asov , laughing loudly .
'@@ That 's just so ! ' repeated the old man , who was standing near by , answering a glance that was accidentally thrown at him .
'@@ no , my dear sir ! you are beaten ! completely beaten ! ' shouted Kat@@ av@@ asov mer@@ r@@ ily .
Levin fl@@ ushed with anno@@ y@@ ance , not at being beaten , but because he had not ref@@ rained from the dispute .
'@@ no , I must not dispute with them , ' he thought . ' they are cl@@ ad in im@@ penetr@@ able arm@@ our , and I am naked . '
he saw that it was not possible to convince his brother and Kat@@ av@@ asov , and still less did he see any possibility of himself agreeing with them .
what they advocated was that same pride of intellect that had nearly ruined him .
we joy@@ fully promise complete obedience .
all lab@@ ours , all humili@@ ations , all sacrifices we take upon ourselves ; but we will not judge or decide ! '
but the people now , according to his brother , were ren@@ ouncing that exemption they had purchased at so high a price .
he wanted to ask why , if public opinion is an inf@@ alli@@ ble judge , is a Revolution and a Commun@@ e " ' not as lawful as the movement in favour of the Slavs ?
but all these were thoughts that could not decide anything .
the PR@@ IN@@ CE AND KO@@ Z@@ NY@@ SH@@ E@@ V GO@@ T IN@@ TO THE TRA@@ P and drove off ; the rest of the party , ha@@ st@@ ening their steps , went home on foot .
but the cloud , now wh@@ iter now bl@@ acker , approached so rapidly that it was necessary to hurry still more to reach home before the rain came .
the fore part of the cloud , low and black like soo@@ ty smoke , rushed with unusual swi@@ ft@@ ness across the sky .
when they were still about two hundred p@@ aces from the house the wind had already risen , so that at any moment a down@@ pour might be expected .
Dol@@ ly , struggling with difficulty with the skirts that cl@@ ung to her legs , no longer walked but ran , her eyes fixed on the children .
the men , holding their hats , went on with long strides .
they were just reaching the por@@ ch when a large drop broke against the edge of the iron g@@ utter .
'@@ in K@@ olo@@ k , I expect , and Nur@@ se is with them . '
Levin s@@ nat@@ ched up the pl@@ aids and rushed to the K@@ olo@@ k .
in that short time the centre of the cloud had already so moved over the sun that it was as dark as during an eclipse .
a white curtain of pouring rain was already descending over the distant wood and half the neighbouring field , and was advancing rapidly toward the K@@ olo@@ k .
the moisture of the rain , shattered into minute drops , filled the air .
'@@ Oh God !
Oh God ! only not on them ! ' he said .
having run to the spot where they generally went , he did not find them there .
they were at the other end of the wood , under an old lime tree , and were calling him .
two figures in dark dresses ( they had been light @@@ -@@ @ coloured before ) stood bending over something .
they were Kit@@ ty and the nurse .
the rain was already passing and it was growing lighter when Levin reached them .
the bottom of the nurse 's dress was dry , but Kit@@ ty 's dress was wet through and cl@@ ung close to her .
though the rain had stopped , they were still standing in the same post@@ ures that they had adopted when the storm began : they stood leaning over a per@@ am@@ bul@@ ator with a green hood .
safe ?
thank God ! ' he mut@@ tered , running up to them and spl@@ ashing through the p@@ ud@@ dles with one shoe half off and full of water .
Kit@@ ty 's wet and rosy face was turned to him , tim@@ idly smiling beneath her be@@ dr@@ agg@@ led hat .
I don '@@ t understand how one can be so im@@ prudent ! ' he repro@@ ached his wife in his v@@ ex@@ ation .
I was just wishing to go when he became rest@@ less .
we had to change his things .
we had hardly ... ' Kit@@ ty began exc@@ using herself .
Mit@@ ya was safe and dry and slept un@@ disturbed .
I don '@@ t know what I am saying ! '
after the rain it was too wet to go out walking , besides which the thunder @@@ -@@ @ clouds had not cleared from the horizon , and , now here now there , passed th@@ undering and dark@@ ening along the borders of the sky .
no more disputes arose ; on the contrary , after dinner every one was in the best of spirits .
Koz@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev too was in good spirits and at tea , led on by his brother , exp@@ ounded his views of the future of the Eastern question , and did it so simply and well that every one listened attentively .
only Kit@@ ty could not hear him to the end , she was called away to bath Mit@@ ya .
a few minutes after she had gone , Levin too was called to her in the nur@@ sery .
leaving his tea and regre@@ tting the interruption in the interesting conversation , yet uneasy as to why he was sent for , as this only happened on important occasions ; Levin went to the nur@@ sery .
he did not now recall , as he had done before , the whole course of his thoughts ( he did not now need to ) .
he at once returned to the feeling that directed him , which was related to those thoughts , and he found that feeling in his soul yet more powerful and definite than before .
now it was not as it used to be with him when he@@ . had invented ways of tranqu@@ illi@@ zing himself and had been obliged to recapit@@ ulate the whole train of reflections in order to arrive at the feeling .
now , on the contrary , the feelings of joy and tranqu@@ ill@@ ity were more vivid than before and his thoughts could not keep pace with them .
just as he was entering the nur@@ sery he remembered what it was he had hidden from himself .
it was that if the principal proof of the existence of a De@@ ity is His revelation of what is good , why is that revelation confined to the Christian Church alone ?
what relation to that revelation have the Buddhist and the Ma@@ hom@@ ed@@ an faiths , which also teach and do good ?
it seemed to him that he had a reply to that question ; but he had no time to express it to himself before he entered the nur@@ sery .
Kit@@ ty was standing , with her sle@@ eves rolled up , beside the bath in which the baby was spl@@ ashing about , and hearing her husband 's step she turned her face toward him , bec@@ k@@ oning him with a smile .
with one hand supporting the head of the pl@@ ump kicking baby who floated on his back , with the other she squeezed the water from a spon@@ ge over him , regularly exer@@ ting the muscles of her arm .
'@@ There , come and look ! look ! ' she said when her husband came up .
the point was that Mit@@ ya had that day obviously and undoubtedly begun to recognize his own people .
directly Levin approached the bath he was shown an experiment which succeeded perfectly .
the cook , who had been called specially for the purpose , bent over him .
Kit@@ ty bent over him , and his face lit up with a smile , he pressed his hand into the spon@@ ge and bub@@ bled with his lips , producing such a cont@@ ented and peculiar sound that not only Kit@@ ty and the nurse , but Levin too went into unexpected rap@@ tures .
you said you felt nothing for him . '
'@@ no , did I say I felt nothing ?
I only said I was disillu@@ sioned . '
'@@ What ! disillu@@ sioned with him ? '
'@@ Not so much with him as with my own feeling ; I had expected more .
I had expected that , like a surprise , a new , pleasant feeling would awaken in me .
and then instead of that , nothing but re@@ pulsion and pity ... '
she listened attentively , replacing on her sl@@ ender fingers , across the baby , the rings she had taken off to bath Mit@@ ya .
'@@ And above all , the anxiety and pity were far greater than the pleasure .
'@@ W@@ ere you very frightened ? ' she asked . ' I was too , but to me it appears more dreadful now that it is past .
but how nice Kat@@ av@@ asov is !
and in general the whole day has been so pleasant .
and you are so nice to your brother when you like ...
it is always hot and ste@@ am@@ y here after the bath . '
when ON leaving THE nur@@ sery Levin was alone , he at once remembered the thought that had not seemed quite clear .
instead of going back to the drawing @@@ -@@ @ room , wh@@ ence came the sound of voices , he stopped on the ver@@ and@@ ah and leaning on the bal@@ u@@ str@@ ade gaz@@ ed at the sky .
it had grown quite dark , and to the south , where he was looking , the sky was clear .
the clouds were in the opposite direction .
there lightning fl@@ ashed and distant thunder rolled .
Levin listened to the rhyth@@ m@@ ical dri@@ pping of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps from the lime trees in the garden , and looked at a familiar triangular const@@ ellation and at the Mil@@ ky Way which with its branches inter@@ sec@@ ted it .
at every flash of lightning not only the Mil@@ ky Way but even the bright stars vanished ; but immediately afterwards they re@@ appeared in the same places , as if thrown there by some un@@ er@@ ring hand .
'@@ Well , what is perpl@@ exing me ? ' Levin asked himself , feeling in advance that the solution of his doubts , though as yet unknown to him , was already in his soul .
'@@ And could the astronomers understand and calculate anything if they took into their calculation the whole of the complicated and varied motions of the earth ?
the question of other cre@@ eds and their relation to the De@@ ity I have not the right or possibility of deciding . '
but she would not have been able to discern its expression had not a flash of lightning that eff@@ ac@@ ed the stars lit it up .
by the light of that flash she saw the whole of his face and , noticing that he was calm and happy , she smiled at him .
shall I tell her or not ?
yes , I will ... '
be good and go to the corner room and see how they have arranged things for Sergi@@ us Ivan@@ ich !
'@@ Yes , certainly I will , ' said Levin , standing upright and kis@@ sing her .
'@@ no , I had better not tell her , ' he thought when she had passed out before him . ' it is a secret , necessary and important for me alone , and in@@ expres@@ sible in words . '
'@@ This new feeling has not changed me , has not rendered me happy , nor suddenly illuminated me as I dream@@ t it would , but is just like my feeling for my son .
it has not been a surprise either .
but be it faith or not - I do not know what it is - this feeling has also entered im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly through suffering and is firmly rooted in my soul .
