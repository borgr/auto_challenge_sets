this was the dedication of the altar , in the day when it was anointed , by the princes of Israel : twelve chargers of silver , twelve silver bowls , twelve spoons of gold :
and Moses , and Aaron , and all the congregation of the children of Israel , did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so did the children of Israel unto them .
and those men said unto him , We are defiled by the dead body of a man : Wherefore are we kept back , that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel ?
and when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle , then after that the children of Israel journeyed : and in the place where the cloud abode , there the children of Israel pitched their tents .
and they departed from the mount of the LORD three days ' journey : and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days ' journey , to search out a resting place for them .
shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them , to suffice them ? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them , to suffice them ?
the LORD is longsuffering , and of great mercy , forgiving iniquity and transgression , and by no means clearing the guilty , visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation .
and Aaron took as Moses commanded , and ran into the midst of the congregation ; and , behold , the plague was begun among the people : and he put on incense , and made an atonement for the people .
and whatsoever is first ripe in the land , which they shall bring unto the LORD , shall be thine ; every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it .
but the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation , and they shall bear their iniquity : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations , that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance .
thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes , which ye receive of the children of Israel ; and ye shall give thereof the LORD 's heave offering to Aaron the priest .
then the priest shall wash his clothes , and he shall bathe his flesh in water , and afterward he shall come into the camp , and the priest shall be unclean until the even .
then came the children of Israel , even the whole congregation , into the desert of Zin in the first month : and the people abode in Kadesh ; and Miriam died there , and was buried there .
and they came to Balaam , and said to him , Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor , Let nothing , I pray thee , hinder thee from coming unto me :
then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam , and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way , and his sword drawn in his hand : and he bowed down his head , and fell flat on his face .
and the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam , Go with the men : but only the word that I shall speak unto thee , that thou shalt speak . so Balaam went with the princes of Balak .
who can count the dust of Jacob , and the number of the fourth part of Israel ? let me die the death of the righteous , and let my last end be like his !
and when he looked on Amalek , he took up his parable , and said , Amalek was the first of the nations ; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever .
command the children of Israel , and say unto them , My offering , and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire , for a sweet savour unto me , shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season .
but ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering unto the LORD ; two young bullocks , and one ram , and seven lambs of the first year : they shall be unto you without blemish :
also in the day of the firstfruits , when ye bring a new meat offering unto the LORD , after your weeks be out , ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work :
but ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD for a sweet savour ; one young bullock , one ram , and seven lambs of the first year ; they shall be unto you without blemish :
these six cities shall be a refuge , both for the children of Israel , and for the stranger , and for the sojourner among them : that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither .
because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest : but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession .
so ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are : for blood it defileth the land : and the land CANNOT be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein , but by the blood of him that shed it .
and they said , The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel : and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters .
so shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe : for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers .
and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands , and brought it down unto us , and brought us word again , and said , It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us .
then we turned , and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea , as the LORD spake unto me : and we compassed mount Seir many days .
meddle not with them ; for I will not give you of their land , no , not so much as a foot breadth ; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau for a possession .
and this land , which we possessed at that time , from Aroer , which is by the river Arnon , and half mount Gilead , and the cities thereof , gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites .
but the LORD hath taken you , and brought you forth out of the iron furnace , even out of Egypt , to be unto him a people of inheritance , as ye are this day .
and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD : that it may be well with thee , and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers ,
who fed thee in the wilderness with manna , which thy fathers knew not , that he might humble thee , and that he might prove thee , to do thee good at thy latter end ;
and the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera : there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest 's office in his stead .
at that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi , to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD , to stand before the LORD to minister unto him , and to bless in his name , unto this day .
and it shall come to pass , if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day , to love the LORD your God , and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul ,
there shall no man be able to stand before you : for the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon , as he hath said unto you .
and thou shalt stone him with stones , that he die ; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God , which brought thee out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage .
for the poor shall never cease out of the land : therefore I command thee , saying , Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother , to thy poor , and to thy needy , in thy land .
thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock , and out of thy floor , and out of thy winepress : of that wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him .
then thou shalt take an aul , and thrust it through his ear unto the door , and he shall be thy servant for ever . and also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise .
and it be told thee , and thou hast heard of it , and inquired diligently , and , behold , it be true , and the thing certain , that such abomination is wrought in Israel :
thou shalt not remove thy neighbour 's landmark , which they of old time have set in thine inheritance , which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it .
but thou shalt utterly destroy them ; namely , the Hittites , and the Amorites , the Canaanites , and the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites ; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee :
but he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn , by giving him a double portion of all that he hath : for he is the beginning of his strength ; the right of the firstborn is his .
and they shall say unto the elders of his city , This our son is stubborn and rebellious , he will not obey our voice ; he is a glutton , and a drunkard .
but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing ; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death : for as when a man riseth against his neighbour , and slayeth him , even so is this matter :
in any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down , that he may sleep in his own raiment , and bless thee : and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God .
and it shall be , that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead , that his name be not put out of Israel .
and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee , that thou shalt set thee up great stones , and plaister them with plaister :
blessed shall be the fruit of thy body , and the fruit of thy ground , and the fruit of thy cattle , the increase of thy kine , and the flocks of thy sheep .
the LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses , and in all that thou settest thine hand unto ; and he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee .
and thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other gods to serve them .
thou shalt betroth a wife , and another man shall lie with her : thou shalt build an house , and thou shalt not dwell therein : thou shalt plant a vineyard , and shalt not gather the grapes thereof .
ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God ; your captains of your tribes , your elders , and your officers , with all the men of Israel ,
and the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel , according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law :
and he said unto them , I am an hundred and twenty years old this day ; I can no more go out and come in : also the LORD hath said unto me , Thou shalt not go over this Jordan .
and Moses wrote this law , and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi , which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD , and unto all the elders of Israel .
my doctrine shall drop as the rain , my speech shall distil as the dew , as the small rain upon the tender herb , and as the showers upon the grass :
were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy , lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely , and lest they should say , Our hand is high , and the LORD hath not done all this .
bless , LORD , his substance , and accept the work of his hands : smite through the loins of them that rise against him , and of them that hate him , that they rise not again .
and thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant , saying , When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan , ye shall stand still in Jordan .
and Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan , in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood : and they are there unto this day .
and he brought the family of Judah ; and he took the family of the Zarhites : and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man ; and Zabdi was taken :
and he brought his household man by man ; and Achan , the son of Carmi , the son of Zabdi , the son of Zerah , of the tribe of Judah , was taken .
and the ambush arose quickly out of their place , and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand : and they entered into the city , and took it , and hasted and set the city on fire .
they did work wilily , and went and made as if they had been ambassadors , and took old sacks upon their asses , and wine bottles , old , and rent , and bound up ;
and they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal , and said unto him , and to the men of Israel , We be come from a far country : now therefore make ye a league with us .
and they said unto him , From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God : for we have heard the fame of him , and all that he did in Egypt ,
and these bottles of wine , which we filled , were new ; and , behold , they be rent : and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey .
them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite : and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and the half tribe of Manasseh .
all the kingdom of Og in Bashan , which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei , who remained of the remnant of the giants : for these did Moses smite , and cast them out .
this then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families ; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast .
and the east border was the salt sea , even unto the end of Jordan . and their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan :
and the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir , and passed along unto the side of mount jearim , which is Chesalon , on the north side , and went down to Beth @-@ Shemesh , and passed on to Timnah :
and the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side ; and the border went about eastward unto Taanath @-@ Shiloh , and passed by it on the east to Janohah ;
and the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua , saying , Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit , seeing I am a great people , forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto ?
and Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph , even to Ephraim and to Manasseh , saying , Thou art a great people , and hast great power : thou shalt not have one lot only :
and was drawn from the north , and went forth to En @-@ Shemesh , and went forth toward Geliloth , which is over against the going up of Adummim , and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben ,
and then the coast turneth to Ramah , and to the strong city Tyre ; and the coast turneth to Hosah ; and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib :
that ye come not among these nations , these that remain among you ; neither make mention of the name of their gods , nor cause to swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow yourselves unto them :
else if ye do in any wise go back , and cleave unto the remnant of these nations , even these that remain among you , and shall make marriages with them , and go in unto them , and they to you :
and Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem , and called for the elders of Israel , and for their heads , and for their judges , and for their officers ; and they presented themselves before God .
now therefore fear the LORD , and serve him in sincerity and in truth : and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood , and in Egypt ; and serve ye the LORD .
and Joshua said unto the people , Ye CANNOT serve the LORD : for he is an holy God ; he is a jealous God ; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins .
namely , five lords of the Philistines , and all the Canaanites , and the Sidonians , and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon , from mount Baal @-@ Hermon unto the entering in of Hamath .

and the princes of Issachar were with Deborah ; even Issachar , and also Barak : he was sent on foot into the valley . for the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart .
that the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel , which said unto them , Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , I brought you up from Egypt , and brought you forth out of the house of bondage ;
and he said unto them , Look on me , and do likewise : and , behold , when I come to the outside of the camp , it shall be that , as I do , so shall ye do .
thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel , so that they lifted up their heads no more . and the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon .
and Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother 's brethren , and communed with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother 's father , saying ,
and his mother 's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words : and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech ; for they said , He is our brother .
and the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah , Therefore we turn again to thee now , that thou mayest go with us , and fight against the children of Ammon , and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead .
then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah , and he passed over Gilead , and Manasseh , and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead , and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon .
and she said unto her father , Let this thing be done for me : let me alone two months , that I may go up and down upon the mountains , and bewail my virginity , I and my fellows .

and he said , Ye have taken away my gods which I made , and the priest , and ye are gone away : and what have I more ? and what is this that ye say unto me , What aileth thee ?

and his master said unto him , We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger , that is not of the children of Israel ; we will pass over to Gibeah .
so the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten : for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites , because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah .
the LORD grant you that ye may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband . then she kissed them ; and they lifted up their voice , and wept .
so Naomi returned , and Ruth the Moabitess , her daughter in law , with her , which returned out of the country of Moab : and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest .
and she went , and came , and gleaned in the field after the reapers : and her HAP was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz , who was of the kindred of Elimelech .
and she said , I pray you , let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves : so she came , and hath continued even from the morning until now , that she tarried a little in the house .
then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said unto him , Why have I found grace in thine eyes , that thou shouldest take knowledge of me , seeing I am a stranger ?
and when Boaz had eaten and drunk , and his heart was merry , he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn : and she came softly , and uncovered his feet , and laid her down .
now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing , for to confirm all things ; a man plucked off his shoe , and gave it to his neighbour : and this was a testimony in Israel .
and as he did so year by year , when she went up to the house of the LORD , so she provoked her ; therefore she wept , and did not eat .
and the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel : and when they joined battle , Israel was smitten before the Philistines : and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men .
and it came to pass , while the ark abode in Kirjath @-@ jearim , that the time was long ; for it was twenty years : and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD .
and when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh , the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel . and when the children of Israel heard it , they were afraid of the Philistines .
and the LORD said unto Samuel , hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee : for they have not rejected thee , but they have rejected me , that I should not reign over them .

now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was Kish , the son of Abiel , the son of Zeror , the son of Bechorath , the son of Aphiah , a Benjamite , a mighty man of power .
then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom , and wrote it in a book , and laid it up before the LORD . and Samuel sent all the people away , every man to his house .
and all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines , and that Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines . and the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal .
and there was trembling in the host , in the field , and among all the people : the garrison , and the spoilers , they also trembled , and the earth quaked : so it was a very great trembling .
and the people flew upon the spoil , and took sheep , and oxen , and calves , and slew them on the ground : and the people did eat them with the blood .
and Saul said , They have brought them from the Amalekites : for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen , to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God ; and the rest we have utterly destroyed .
so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone , and smote the Philistine , and slew him ; but there was no sword in the hand of David .
and Saul was very wroth , and the saying displeased him ; and he said , They have ascribed unto David ten thousands , and to me they have ascribed but thousands : and what can he have more but the kingdom ?
and Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin ; but he slipped away out of Saul 's presence , and he smote the javelin into the wall : and David fled , and escaped that night .
then Ahimelech answered the king , and said , And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David , which is the king 's son in law , and goeth at thy bidding , and is honourable in thine house ?

but it came to pass in the morning , when the wine was gone out of Nabal , and his wife had told him these things , that his heart died within him , and he became as a stone .
and she arose , and bowed herself on her face to the earth , and said , Behold , let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord .
and Abigail hasted , and arose , and rode upon an ass , with five damsels of hers that went after her ; and she went after the messengers of David , and became his wife .
and , behold , as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes , so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD , and let him deliver me out of all tribulation .
Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master 's servants that are come with thee : and as soon as ye be up early in the morning , and have light , depart .
and they cut off his head , and stripped off his armour , and sent into the land of the Philistines round about , to publish it in the house of their idols , and among the people .
and they mourned , and wept , and fasted until even , for Saul , and for Jonathan his son , and for the people of the LORD , and for the house of Israel ; because they were fallen by the sword .
and David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh @-@ Gilead , and said unto them , Blessed be ye of the LORD , that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord , even unto Saul , and have buried him .
and they caught every one his fellow by the head , and thrust his sword in his fellow 's side ; so they fell down together : Wherefore that place was called Helkath @-@ hazzurim , which is in Gibeon .
and they took up Asahel , and buried him in the sepulchre of his father , which was in Bethlehem . and Joab and his men went all night , and they came to Hebron at break of day .
and they set the ark of God upon a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah : and Uzzah and Ahio , the sons of Abinadab , drave the new cart .
so David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David : but David carried it aside into the house of Obed @-@ Edom the Gittite .
I will be his father , and he shall be my son . if he commit iniquity , I will chasten him with the rod of men , and with the stripes of the children of men :
and he said , If the Syrians be too strong for me , then thou shalt help me : but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee , then I will come and help thee .
and the Syrians fled before Israel ; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians , and forty thousand horsemen , and smote Shobach the captain of their host , who died there .
and when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel , they made peace with Israel , and served them . so the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more .
and David said to Uriah , Go down to thy house , and wash thy feet . and Uriah departed out of the king 's house , and there followed him a mess of meat from the king .
and she had a garment of divers colours upon her : for with such robes were the king 's daughters that were virgins apparelled . then his servant brought her out , and bolted the door after her .
and it came to pass , while they were in the way , that tidings came to David , saying , Absalom hath slain all the king 's sons , and there is not one of them left .
for we must needs die , and are as water spilt on the ground , which CANNOT be gathered up again ; neither doth God respect any person : yet doth he devise means , that his banished be not expelled from him .
then the king answered and said unto the woman , Hide not from me , I pray thee , the thing that I shall ask thee . and the woman said , Let my lord the king now speak .
to fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing : and my lord is wise , according to the wisdom of an angel of God , to know all things that are in the earth .
so Joab came to the king , and told him : and when he had called for Absalom , he came to the king , and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king kissed Absalom .
and one told David , saying , Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom . and David said , O LORD , I pray thee , turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness .
then said the king to Ziba , Behold , thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth . and Ziba said , I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight , my lord , O king .

and Hushai said unto Absalom , Nay ; but whom the LORD , and this people , and all the men of Israel , choose , his will I be , and with him will I abide .
therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee , from Dan even to Beer @-@ sheba , as the sand that is by the sea for multitude ; and that thou go to battle in thine own person .
and the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai , saying , Deal gently for my sake with the young man , even with Absalom . and all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom .
then said Joab , I may not tarry thus with thee . and he took three darts in his hand , and thrust them through the heart of Absalom , while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak .
and Joab said unto him , Thou shalt not bear tidings this day , but thou shalt bear tidings another day : but this day thou shalt bear no tidings , because the king 's son is dead .
and David sat between the two gates : and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold a man running alone .

and after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite . and the Philistines were gathered together into a troop , where was a piece of ground full of lentiles : and the people fled from the Philistines .
and Abishai , the brother of Joab , the son of Zeruiah , was chief among three . and he lifted up his spear against three hundred , and slew them , and had the name among three .
and his father had not displeased him at any time in saying , Why hast thou done so ? and he also was a very goodly man ; and his mother bare him after Absalom .
and while he yet spake , behold , Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came : and Adonijah said unto him , Come in ; for thou art a valiant man , and bringest good tidings .
and the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest , and Nathan the prophet , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and the Cherethites , and the Pelethites , and they have caused him to ride upon the king 's mule :
then she said , I desire one small petition of thee ; I pray thee , say me not nay . and the king said unto her , Ask on , my mother : for I will not say thee nay .
and it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD ; and , behold , he is by the altar . then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , saying , Go , fall upon him .
Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead , in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites , and of Og king of Bashan ; and he was the only officer which was in the land .
